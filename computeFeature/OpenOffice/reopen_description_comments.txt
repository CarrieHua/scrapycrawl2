id=82067	Now OO 2.3.0 saves files with embedded MathML formulas into MS Word 2007 just asembedded OpenOffice Math objects - but since MS Word 2007 have native supportfor editable formulas in it we should (: or even must :) save formulas in nativeMS Word 2007 format (look like it called Office MathML -OMML)If to be truly - now MS Office even can`t open docx file saved from OOWriter2.3.0 which contain (for example) only one small formula ("sqrt 4") - it reportabout "file is corrupt". When i look inside this file i notice that math objectstored as OOMath object instead of native OMML. So i will not report error about"saving with embedded math not work" because i think this module must be notjust fixed but rewrited.With best wishes,Slavp.s. It is my first bug report to OpenOffice.org :) Createdfile with sqrt 4 formula saved as docx (MS Word 2007 format)@AMA: Please have a look..What OpenOffice.org version do you use? "Normal" OOo2.3.0 has no "save as" or"export to" docx-format.i use russian build of OpenOffice 2.3.0 - look like it contain novell`s plugin(OO port for) here is written - "Novell'scontribution to the ODF Converter project is porting and integration withOpenOffice.org" in this case where i can place bugs? what if i install latestdeveloper build of OO?where did you get that build?From link at openoffice.org, maybe OO 2.3 while install inherit plugins fromprevious version - novell`s plugin probably was just inherited from previous OO.I remember that i evaluate it some time ago but denied it because poor quality.By the way since Novell without warning drop developing XForms plugin for IE inot trust to Novell at all. Is Microsoft-sponsored odf-converter code can beused for including in OO code?Fridrich, please have a look.If you replace the Novell edition of OOo with an upstream version, whenever youtell OOo to save as OOXML, it will save a simple ODF because there are somehooks missing in the version of OOo that allowed to use a command-line tool. Thesolution is either to use the Novell edition of OOo that can be found here:or simply uninstall the plugin extension so thatit does not misslead you believing that you are saving in docx file-format. Theupstream version of OpenOffice.org is not yet able to save as docx although weare jointly (Novell/Sun) working on this possibility and will have it readysometimes in the 3.x release cycle.BTW, in case you really really need to convert those documents, the ooo-buildbased version is releasing a preview version of our joint filters in 2.3. Forbeing able to export, you still will have to use this ooo-build based versionwith the updated odf-converter plugin(Please let's try to use consistent terminology here, "extension" and not"plugin". Sure, they mean about the same I guess, but in OOo it's "extension".)Unfortunately there is no way (as far as I know) for the odfconverter extension(as installed from the .oxt file) to tell the hosting OpenOffice.org that itrequires features so far only present in the ooo-build builds (including NovellEdition), i.e. the pre- and postprocessing hooks.The odfconverter extension is just compiled and packaged by Novell, with theactual code we have very little to do.That's really situation that Microsoft Office customers do not have any problemwith OppenOffice files, but OpenOffice customers can't open Microsoft Office2007 files. The simplest way to not have any problems is to pay and install MSOffice and forget about OpenOffice...close the invalid issueit is not true - it can be implemented
id=36144	The ability to select the color of the font (Format/Chatacter/Font Effects)needs to be added. When the font color is Automatic, the shadow color is LightGray. Any other color and it turns black. This has been a missing piece for a long time. It is a significant annoyance tohave to return to Word just to get the correct shadow, or have to use FontWorkin a place that disrupts the format management of the document.This may seem minor but the lack of basic operations such as this gives newusers the impression that this is an unfinished product and not ready forprime-time. Clearly untrue but perception becomes the reality in the minds ofpotential users. reassigned to BH.Putting Draw objects into a Writer document is a suboptimal solution and has possibly undesireable implications for flow and layout in some cases, in addition to the obvious UI considerations. Long-term, it would be verynice to have UI for this in Writer. Ideally, it would also be nice to beable to change the depth/position of the shadow on text, like you can do onframes and tables and so on -- FontWorks does that too (well, position), but there's no UI for it in Writer, and if implemented it logically would belong in the same place as the UI for shadow color. That could be considered beyond the scope of this bug and separate, though.This DESIGN DEFECT (is is not an "enhancement") still exists in 2.3.1, it mustbe addressed.Looks like a duplicate of(Feature)This has been a design DEFECT (not a feature enhancement) since before 2004.

Anyway, 3.0.0 willnot be included in Ubuntu 8.10 which will be released next month. That means wemay need to wait around 6 months to get OOo work by default after installingUbuntu and also other distributions.Is it possible to point us to some patches for backport?The fixes for issues 89262 and forprobably solved this problem here.If Ubuntu needs to stay with OOo2.4.1 I really recommend that they integrate these fixes into their build.Here are the minimal patches for the backport:?r1=1.154.102.2&r2=1.154.102.3ClosedIf you check this issue by using the test document attached with OpenOffice3.0.0rc1 20080904 you will see for yourself how this issue is NOT yet resolvedfor OpenOffice 3.0.0rc1 20080904! Rendering / Printing Errors still exist forsome Thai fonts. Garuda and Norasi are two notable examples. Are there others?CreatedSample test document >> Checked against OOo 3.0.0rc1 20080904Well, I think we have here different problems (printing, rendering) so that theyshould be treated separately.I will only treat the rendering problem here.I has a look at your last attachment: "Thai Langauge rendering Test Doc 03.odt" Test environnement: with OOO300m7 on Ubuntu 8.10 alpha.Fonts present in the document and on my system:- Garuda - Lucida Sans- Waree- NorasiFonts present in the document but NOT on my system:- Arial- Angsana New- Times New RomanYour problem: Though you wrote "correct/incorrect" I guess we can express theproblem with: the diacritical signs of some letters are sometimes not placed onthe letter, sometimes crushed together. Is that correct?My results: At anytime I could reproduce the rendering problem of diacriticalsas it shows on your screen shots.NEEDMOREINFO:- Please send me by mail all the fonts listed above which show the problem.Write the issue number in the subject line.- Test if this rendering problem does/doesn't show *with the same fonts* inother non OOo application (Text Editor, Mailer, other word processor)of course I meant: "at NO time I could reproduce..."Waiting for information.I can give the exact problem explanation here.The real problem is sara-um, "ำ". This character consists of 2 parts which oneof them must be rendered on previous character, e.g., "อำ". This problem willoccur with upper character after sara-um for example "่" in "ตำแหน่ง".One thing I can notice is that it seems this problem only occurs withdistribution specific binary. Note that it occurs on many distributionsincluding ubuntu and mandriva. However, there is no problem for binary from OOo.Other applications on ubuntu has no problem like this.I will try to send all fonts to you. Hope my guess of your email is correct.binary from OOo.Now that is interesting. The difference between the builds is that the ICU-version used in OOo-builds is patched, while the distributions prefer the straight version. To fix this problem they probably shouldn't build with "--use-system-icu" unless they are sure that their system-icu is better.Though OOo's layout code could easily handle newer versions of ICU's layout engine, so that the corresponding system-icu wouldn't need the patches, other parts of OOo still depend on specific versions. Seefor the khong's progress on that frontier.I suspect that all applications that use ICU for layout (instead of pango) have the same problems with the same fonts.Correction to the above:is about the using the newer version of icu"There is no problem for binary from OOo"So we can close here.closedSorry for the slow reply.I'm confused by the latest responses from sugree and es.Am I missing something because the formatting errors I have listed as exampleshave been generated with the OOo binary on Windows XP NOT Linux.I am also confused because:- 2 (smackoz, sugree and more) people reported different problems. Sugree'sproblem is solved as "WORKSFORME"- smackoz: you say it happens on Windows, not Linux but in your first commentsyou talk about Ubuntu and the screenshot is on Linux... so what?- Not all the "problems with Thai fonts" are the same problem.So please be clear:- which font on which system makes which problems? Send me the fonts and*describe* the problem (not only with screenshots)- also check in other applications what happens *with the same font*: the linuxscreenshot shows a wrong rendering in OOo compared with a correct rendering in adialog box.

But thanks Hanya, and the patch should be reviewed and/or committed to trunk soon.Add me.4.2.0 build Rev. 1722749 linux-32.The patch works correctly for a vertical sort A1:A4, but it doesn't seem to fix the problem for a horizontal sort -- A1:D1 -- assuming I'm doing the selection correctly. I'll be happy to commit this one, however. Would like additional feedback.(In reply to Kay from)Works for both column and row sorting on my environment. Could you try again or attach some example you have troubled?Since the attached patch influences all functions which use collator service to compare strings like sorting all over the office, these result should be the identical anywhere in the office.I found a problem about sorting with the attached patch in Commen 7. In Writer's table, sorting with/without Match case option gave me the same result.Comment onPatch to set upper first if ignore case is not specifiedSeefor the reason.I tried to analyze about the sorting behavior in Writer's table. Data: b B a AOn 4.1.2, without Match case: a A b B or A a B bOn 4.1.2, with Match case: a A b B (stable but wrong result)Patched, without Match case: a A b B or A a B bPatched, with Match case: A a B b (stable, correct order)Sort again without Match case option, you can observe the change of the order.The observation was wrong which described in. The sorting in Writer's table is not stable, the result is correct. The attached patch is not obsolute but some people might miss judge the result at first observation.Comment onPatch to set upper first if ignore case is not specifiedNot obsolete as per.CreatedSimple writer document with 4 x 4 tableSorts as expected either across first row or down first column.Leaving Case sensitive unchecked sorts with caps before lower case as expected.Using case sensitive sorts with lower case first.CreatedSimple calc doc with some valuesfor 4.1.2 on Linux-32Left to right sort of 1st row does nothing no matter what.Top to bottom of first column produces the following results for me regardless if Case Sensitive is selected or not:aAbBIf Case Sensitive is NOT selected, the normal collation sequence should produce the following results:AaBbLinux-32 on 4.1.2I've added two little test documents that I'm using.My findings so far is that the sort of table elements in Writer works correctly, whereas the sort in Calc does not. Case insensitive -- the normal collation sort -- should produce capital letters before lower case. Case sensitive should do the opposite.Writer uses the phrase "Match case" while Calc uses "Case Sensitive" but I think these phrases should mean the same thing to a user., 18 and 19 are incorrect. in general the comments all seem to indicate that Case Insensitive means sorting in REVERSE collating order. That is NOT what Case Insensitive means. Case Insensitive is NEITHER Upper Case before Lower Case NOR Lower Case before Upper Case. It IGNORES case. Hence the name: Case Insensitive.Case insensitive: ABC = abc = AbC = aBcA case sensitive sort takes the case of a character into account. The collating sequence of ASCII and UNICODE for the ASCII characters is identical. Upper case comes first. So a case sensitive sort should sort the above as: ABC AbC aBc abcIf Lower Case is to be sorted first, that is a Reverse Case Sensitive sort. It is NOT a Case Insensitive sort.A Case Insensitive sort is important. Sort: nice, Nicer, nicest, Nicely, jump Case insensitive: jump, nice, Nicely, Nicer, nicest Case sensitive (Natural Order): Nicely, Nicer, jump, nice, nicest Case sensitive (Reverse Order): nicest, nice, jump, Nicer, NicelyNOTE: Case Insensitive would be preferred when sorting a list of names where some may be capitalized and others not. It is also the sort that would be used by either a Dictionary or Encyclopedia.(In reply to Alan from)You are correct in your assessment. My comments were in relation to what apparently "case insensitive" means within OpenOffice for an alphabetic sort.

According to thecurrent OpenFormula draft:In an OpenDocument document, if an error value is the result of a cellcomputation it shall bestored as if it was a string. That is, the office:value-type of an error valueis string; if thecomputed value is stored, it is stored in the attribute office:string-value.Note that thisdoes not change an error into a string type (since the error will be restored onrecalculation); thissimply enables applications which cannot recalculate values to display the errorinformation.Currently in OOo, calculating FLOOR(-2.5) shows as an error but is saved withvalue-type float and value 0, causing other applications to display thecalculated value incorrectly.

As theslide was removed from the document and placed in the undo, this api slide wasdisposed. After executing undo, that slide still was disposed (as there is nocomming back from a disposed state) and so the xml export failed.I fixed this by changing the lifetime of an api slide.

RPMs areuseless to many users. tar.gz will work for all Linux users. I sent an email to(second time, with correct emailaddress). Hopefully, it should appear in their archive atMail was sent at 2006-12-24 / Dec 2006.***has been confirmed by votes. ***take this one. plan: look for possiblilty to provide those archive with the next snapshots.reassignI refer the developers to my comments in 44102.The ordinary user of 1.x could use a universal installer in any variant oflinux. The ordinary user of 2.x had to struggle with .rpm files instead. 44102was allegedly "fixed" by adding facilities to the build method which were of nouse at all to ordinary users trying to download from the web site, as none ofthe extra facilities mentioned in the alleged "fix" of 44102 made it to thedownloadable versions. Only the .rpms continued to be offered in .tar.gz form[1]. I stand by the idea of re-instating something like the universal installer forordinary users of Linux. Read most of 44102 to see why.[1] Perhaps the title of this issue should be "give users back the universalinstaller"?I think that Sun is trying to impose RPM as standard (because [Open]SuSE use RPMtoo), but tar.gz is better because any distro can use this format.I use OpenSuSE, but only RPM/DEB is useless and tar.gz is more compatible.As discussed in the releases@ooo list, this is a wont-fix.Someone might to set up a mirror and provide it, but the OOo mirrors won't havethe tar.gz uploaded. That would mean deleting a lot of "older but stillsupported" versions and it would make it hard to add new languages.See cloph comments onalso.Closing issue.Well, the users could, in a non-official way, provide the tar.gz files throughtorrent.Asrail, why you close this issue?Workarrounds (as comment by cloph in 44102 issue) can't close this issue!Non-Official way (as torrent) can't close this issue!next time, if you're not willing to fix an issue, don't stall your users bytelling them to open new bug reports. don't waste my time for defects you're notwilling to / cannot fix.Renato,wontfix does not means it was resolved, means we don't have enough resources toresolve it now.Sun has nothing with [Open]SuSE, by the way.RPM is defined as the package format for the "linux standard base":LSB is not mandatory, but it's interesting in case of conflicts, like this.Towsonu,you've participated of the discussions. No one had declared that one finished,but we don't have new mail there for two days and no advocate mail for 6 days.You or someone else could (can) give a strong argument for this.You can still voting, as the issue could be reopened.all arguments were provided atin the meantime, releases@ooo should have discussed this in the bug report sothe users could keep an eye on the discussion.I feel that the attitude over this issue has, from the start, been high handed and arrogant.I /like/ OOo very much, and admire the availability of the issuezilla system. In general it works well. But it is not an efficient method of establishing 2-way communications on non-techincal decisions.I have seen nothing that justifies the original change to .rpm packaging. There were no issues saying "the universal installer in 1.1 does not work" nor user clamour for change. If you combine the various reactions in the various issuezilla issues with the feelings on the oooforums.org site there is a lot of difficulty with the .rpm solution, and a lot of unhappiness among the people who matter most to the project, the ordinary users.Now "wontfix" is at least a decision, which is better than some of the infinite dangling that goes on with other matters. But I don't consider it a sensible one until a detailed, argued, case has been plainly put in public - perhaps on the download page for linux - explaining why the software cannot be released in the universal manner that 1.1 was, or ready-to-run binary like firefox.Maybe it is OOo's policy that linux distos should have thier own pacakage format in thier own online repository, because that will serve the users better. If so, please say so politely and with conviction and in public. Maybe there are testing resource limitiations that the universal installer identified. So let us know, informatively and in detail. The original issue had over 50 votes. This one has 14 already. It obviously matters to people.I remain astonished that in 44102 we were told that the work had been done to support varied distribution methods, and here we are being told that work will not be capitalised upon!Issue Tracker is not an efficient way of establishing communication onnon-technical decisions and was not intended to it and for each issue we have tohave a different report.The universal installer was dropped because it was hard to maintain. We hadn'tpeople to still developing it and to test on different platforms.It's too hard to understand we're lacking resources?The project have to maintain old releases in the servers, because some usershave to use an older release for some reason (a bug in newer releases thatdoesn't allow them to open a document, for instance).We already are dropping the releases too early, because we're providing newmajor versions quickly.All of you have to understand the comments on the issues aren't read by almostanyone.The issue exists to tell there is a problem, you can cite it, etc.You may want to check the "discuss" list if you wanna a discussion with a greatvisibility:There are more people in the "releases" list than here listening to this threadand were told to discuss it there, everyone were able to join.It already has been discussed there, so it would be better use the "discuss"list first, mentioning this issue.Another thing: as already said a lot of times, a tar.gz can be created from theRPM files, you can see it in the comments of.Supporting a new package officially also means a lot more of efforts to test itand assure it works, as the packaging may include some bugs.About the universal installer, as the project is made up from volunteers, wedon't have anyone interested in making one right now. We have a lot of importantissues to resolve.I'm reopening this one for the complaints.set target 3.01Âº- yes, rpm is the LSB package, but that doesnt mean that everyone agree withit. A rpm can also be made from a tar.gz package, but as convert from rpm totar.gz, convert tar.gz to rpm is a pain...2Âº- tar.gz everyone can use it, tar and gzip are included in all distros, rpmmight not be and even worst, rpm converters arent for sure installed by defaultin any distro.3Âº- you now have a .deb package, so there are resources for it, but not for asingle tar.gz?i would suggest that OOo build a tar.gz (or tar.bz2) ONLY for the latestversion, it would help 99% of the users that want tar.gz and for those that needolder versions, they can fallback to the rpm conversion.i can even offer myself to build the tar.gz (upon test, if enough smaller, iwould prefer tar.bz2) if OOo would agree in distributing then just like the .rpmand the .devproblem actually is the distribution of the tarballs, might be possible if wedrop the version not including the jre.i actually vote the opposite... drop the version WITH the JRE... most distrosalready have java included or have packaged available. For those without, candownload the JRE from the java.com site. Also, most users will not even need thefeatures that require the java.just having the OOo with Jre is a (little) waste of space/bandwidth, speciallyfor those with slow net connections and/or traffic limitsI agree with higuita: the java version bundled in OOo is almost useless on anymodern Linux distro. If you need space, drop the version with java.I donÂ´t waste my time on this issue anymore!We are talking about this since(from 2005)!FOUR years is enough!This is the true:"Hey, we like just RPM, and go to the hell if you need a tarball!"This is bullshit:- "We donÂ´t have resource enough to do this"- "We donÂ´t have space enough on our servers/mirrors to add a new package"- "We donÂ´t have time enough to test all instalation sets"
id=107847	Hi devs,I know this is a strange report since it can't be reproduced easily. But pleasehave a look at the link in the URL field above. We are seeing in the forumreports about recovered files changed to hashes especially after a power loss.But not only. And OS is not only Windows.This problem has clearly started with 3.0 version. I've linked as many threadsas I could find in one of the post. They tend to prove that there is somethingbehind that. It's not a general issue (else we would have much more of them).But I'm sure there is some application maybe interfering with temporary files.In the past, if temporary files were touched, OOo could not save the file butthat was all; in this new problem, the content is changed to hashes or pound signs.Thanks to have a look. Are there at least some precise questions to be asked tothe users in such cases? @hagar_de_lest: in support forums or in a bug track system: a problem must be*reproducible* in order to be handled. We already closed other issues mentioningthis because we (and also the reporter) could not reproduce it.Reading further pages "of the Internet" won't help.If you can sum um this with:- a non broken file- a detailed system description and OOo version (please use the latest developerversion)- an exact scenario which leads to...- ...a broken filethen feel free to reopen this issue.For now this report is like "OOo sometimes crashes".ClosedNot my job. Sorry.No further comments.I'd like to reopen this bug.It was closed rather quickly IMHO. Perhaps it will be different now with the new community.See:The list is longer each month.Note that we also have reports with 4.0.We have the same flow of lamentations about document losses in the french forum.The user says that its computer ran out of power and after that its document opens with the ASCII filter. An analysis shows that it contains only bytes of value zero.The corruption appears when working on any application : Writer, Calc , Impress, Base. And also on the most recent versions of Apache OpenOffice.The french forum has a specific section on recovery. Browse it :Here is the translation of most thread titles:document rempli de dieses = document filled with hashesfichier corrompu = file corruptederreur de format = format error (message at opening)perte de document = document lossfiltre ASCII = ASCII filterMost users now work on a laptop, this increases the probability of power loss.The environment and usage of a computer by an ordinary user is not as clean as for a power user like the developers. This is a Quality issue. OpenOffice must be reliable enough for its ordinary users, or they will switch to another Office suite.Cross withThis is very hard or nearly impossible to reproduce. I tried on Mac, create a new file, edit save, edit -> kill the process. Restart and the document recovery recovered the document successful. I would expect the same when the computer turned off.Is it possible to get further information about the used system, file system (nfs, hpfs, etc.)?The thread indicated inlists the OS and OpenOffice versions found in the english forum.In the french forum we have a similar pattern :- mostly Windows, from XP to Windows 8.1, some Linux, a few Mac. This reflects the omnipresence of MS-Windows on the market- any version of OpenOffice up to the most recent.- people complain because they have lost a document they have been working on for weeks, for example a student work. So this is never a simple one-page document.I don't think it is reproducible at will (and I could not reproduce). Killing the soffice process is not same as pulling the plug from mains.Developers should inspect the processes of document saving and document restoration, keeping in mind that the computer may stop anytime.It could be that during the restore process, due to incorrect data, OpenOffice does not really restore but writes null bytes instead, effectively destroying the last save of the document.Keep in mind that documents are often stored on USB stick (or external disk).As MS-Word, users embed many pictures in documents and then, dramatically increase the file size.All bad behaviors contribute to this issue.The problem with AOO working directly on a USB key is known and I've not taken into account those issues in the post that lists all the reports.That still makes... 157 cases of severe data loss.I started with OOo 2.0 in 2005, using it 8 hrs a day at work and never heard about it until the first topics in the forum. The 2.3 version seems to be the starting point.the info with USB drives and external disks is interesting , it goes in the direction of which file system is used. Nevertheless it is really a damn issue and not easy to reproduce.
id=3740	In Excel 97 I create two spreadhseets:In "A" I have a coloumn of numbers, and I assign the name 'test' to the range.In "B" I use a sum() referring to the file A and its named range test. This works properly.If I look at those files in OpenOffice, the reference to the named range in file "B" is lost, and a name error occurs, ie, the conversion goes wrong. I cannot set it manually either; if I select the range in "A", it does not recognize it as a named range.I have put the two files ontoand OOo Calc does not support external named ranges, so the Excel import filter has to procuce an error.I change this item from defect to enhancement. Maybe it is possible to implement this feature.FT->NN: This is an import/export issue. Please verify and retarget it(if necessary).This is not planned for 2.0.***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***My issue number 44292 was closed as a duplicate of this issue, and similarly amore recent issue number 45705 was also closed as a double.This is NOT just an import/export issue as one responder said.Sure, it comes up as a major problem loading spreadsheets from excel intoOpenOffice and basically makes such importing impossible from my perspective,since OpenOffice Calc fails to support properly such a basic function.But even ignoring the excel import issue and considering writing wholly newspreadsheets in Calc without any intention of exporting them it is still a basicneed to reference other Calc files, and using named ranges to do this solvesmany problems which can occur when the referenced file is updated. i.e. when areferenced file is changed, the location of a specific cell may move, say if youhave added a new row, but by referencing it by cell number in the second sheet,you will lose the link. However, if you have referenced by name, then itdoesn't matter how the cell is moved around, it will still be referenced correctly.There does seem to be a messy work around in OpenOffice using DDE, as I noted inmy issue number 44292, which included example attacments. But it would bepreferable if Calc performed this function properly.To my mind this is a basic failing in Calc which makes it unusable in mybusiness, not just a nice enhancement.If the funtion works when using DDE, then why cannot the same code be used tomake it work for normal referencing or when importing/exporting?Please consider introducing the correct functionality as soon as possible.regards.IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE========================There are situations when users need to access data inside a complex spreadsheet(e.g. a master spreadsheet stores uniquely some basic data, and multiple usersin various departments need this data in their work). There are 2 ways to do this: * using DDE-links between the 2 spreadsheets * using a direct reference to the data inside one spreadsheet [aka writing a formula to reference this external data][Please note that the first mechanism does NOT currently work in OOo IF the datarange contains formulas! Therefore, users will be forced to use the 2nd mechanism.]Currently, OOo Calc users will need to reference directly the data inside themaster-spreadsheet, because the external reference mechanism does NOT support*named ranges*.Why are *named ranges* such important?A.) CORRECT RANGE=================Well, IF the user wrote the master-spreadsheet he may be able to recall in whichrows/columns he did store the relevant data. BUT how well will he remember thesedesign details in 2 weeks? And in 2 month?And what are the chances, that a different user will reference the correct range?B.) CHANGING RANGE==================Another even worse problem arises when the initial data range changes: say, onehas to add another data row, so *ALL END USERS* will have to correct theirspreadsheets that link to this master-spreadsheet.This is a formidable task and one that generates numerous *hard-to-trace errors*.These are the main reasons, why it is desirable to link to a named range!To give some better perspective on this issue, lets consider by analogy the C++classes: classes have both private and public methods. End users are howeverable to use only the public methods. These hide the implementation details ofthe private methods. IF something changes internally, the external user shouldnot be affected. It is the same as the OOo UNO-copmonents. This is what namedranges are good for.I hope that my explanation will foster handling named ranges in the externalreference code.----added myself to ccI'm taking ownership.accepting the issue.is reserved specifically for the Excel import issue.Let's target this for 3.1.Ah, maybe not. 3.x that is.turns out that we have to aim for the 3.1 integration.Added this issue to cws mooxlsc.fixed in mooxlsc cws. All issues raised during development have been resolved,so I think it's reasonable to call this "fixed".I have just downloaded OpenOffice 3.0.0 which I assumed would have this issuefixed and it is certainly not fixed. OpenOffice does not work with Excel filesusing named ranges referencing another file. There seems to be no difference inits behaviour in version 3 from version 2. However named ranges within aspreadsheet seem to be accessible. Whist checking this I also found that mostof the DDE links I use do not work though encouragingly when opening aspreadsheet with DDE links it said that the file contained links to another fileand asked if I wanted them updated. I responded Yes but unfortunately they didnot update. However DDe links from one source did update so it could be a nonstandard usage in the other program but either way it will prevent me migratingto Open Office. The failed DDE links look like this if I have not updated links=DDE("TRADER";"LSE\INDICES";"UKX\mid") but return the previous value and lookthe same if I have updated links but return a blank, as opposed to zero ( I haveview zero switched on) . Also although in Options I have update links set to on request at least onespreadsheet automatically updates links to another spreadsheet resulting in nameerrors so I cannot show the link format, However one spreadsheet correctly asksif I want them updated and if I say no the link format is shown as follows:='file:///C:/My Documents/Excel files/OPTVAL.xls'#$A.$D$9I think what distinguishes the spreadsheet that asks about updating links formthe one that does not is the presence of DDE links in it. With spreadsheet onlylinks it goes straight to update. If I update links the result looks like this Err:508The same happens whether it is a named range or a cell reference like this. Dou you have to convert all files to Calc files for links to work or create newlinks from within OpenOffice. I tried this having saved both files in odsformat and following the help instructions using the navigator to create a linkand got a message that the link could not be updated so I will give up onOpenOffice again.I have been linking spreadsheets since Supercalc 30 years ago so this isdisappointing.@fabianfinlay: Note the target of this issue: OOo3.1The implementation is in a CWS not yet integrated. You may track thestatus of the CWS atFor more information on CWSs seeAnd please don't mix in other issues. Query the issue tracker if yourproblem about non-updating links was already reported, and if not filean issue and attach a set of test case documents to reproduce. Thanks.It is sad that this issue continues to drag on.I first commented in March 2005, when they were still developing version 2.0beta.I even gave a bunch of examples and suggestions (Issue number 44292).But then my issue number was cancelled because it duplicated this even earlierone which goes way back to 2002!Now here we are at version 3.0 and still no progress.Maybe it will appear in 3.1, but I wouldn't bet on it.As I've said before, this is a major stumbling block that stops many people frombeing able to use Calc at all.Even Excel 2.0 from 1987 could do something this simple!And while I can't afford to buy the latest Microsoft crap, my Excel 97 stillworks fine.I made a mistake when I said I had been doing this from the days of Supercalc. Yes I had been doing it with Supercalc, Lotus and then Excel but I startedlinking spreadsheets as long ago as Visicalc though I have to say that back thenI don't think it was as easy as using named ranges. Remember that program. Program and data files would fit on a 64k floppy disk and to build anything bigyou had to link them.Sorry I mixed issues. They seem largely related to me as to functionality but Iwill try and do better next time but will wait and see how the fix on namedranges works before I test the other aspects.Reopening.@kohei: Though external references within Calc now work in cws mooxlsc, thesubmitter's test case documentdoesstill produce a #NAME error. Apparently the name does exist,ScExternalRefCache::getRangeNameTokens() finds it, but returns a token arraythat contains one token of type svByte with OpCode ocBad.Well, updating the link does fix it, so it's a matter of importing the cachedname range correctly.Still looking into it.Well, the reason was simple; I forgot to parse range references in the cachedexternal range records in xls. Adding a handler for that fixed the issue.OTOH, I swear I thought I had covered this. Well I guess this simply slipped mymind... :-/fixed again.kohei,Does this mean there is a version we can download now and try out for this issue.fabian@fabianfinley: No, no yet. The only way to test this feature is to download thesource from the cws and build it yourself. The sources can be downloaded bysvn co svn:///ooo/cws/mooxlsc(I think this is right...)Sigh.. I have to reopen this again. The external defined name referencescurrently are not stored in ODF. This has to be specified first. Due to thetight time schedule that would result in the entire CWS mooxlsc not being readybefore OOo3.1 feature freeze. Instead, I remove this issue from the CWS andretarget it to OOo3.2 for a follow-up CWS; the code will remain in place, butthe named reference will not be resolved.set to invalidWhy on earth is this invalid?***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***OOo 3.2 is in show-stopper stage. This issue is re-targeted to OOo 3.x. If thisissue is critical for the current release please target it back.@er: Are there currently any specification efforts on this? If so, can you place some comments on the progress here ? (or maybe in another ticket)So... Any ideas about when will we see this fixed?I saw today there is already a beta version for OOv3.3.Does it happen to store the names in the ODF alerady?Is there annother issue where we can track the specification/implementation progress for storing external defined name references in the ODF?Reset assignee on issues not touched by assignee in more than 1000 days.

That's the answer I've got from MOSIX developers about this problem:"The "mmap" system-call with MAP_SHARED is in fact requesting that themapped file be used as shared-memory. You can find in the MFS documentationthat this feature is not supported: it would be very difficult to supportsuch generic cluster-wide shared-memory (DSM), and even if implemented,the performance would be disastrous, and of course, being a form ofshared-memory, MOSIX would have to force all such processes that use thisfeature to stay on their home-node.I don't know what to suggest at this time other then investigate whyOffice requires this feature: in most cases, this is not really intendedas true shared-memory, but rather as a form of lazy-write: if so, it shouldbe converted to map with MAP_PRIVATE (at least if mapping with MAP_SHAREDfailes), then use the "write" system-call instead of msync/close."Any ideas how to fix this? TM->FT: I think this one is more a request for a feature or anenhancement than a bug. Please have a look at it. Thanks !Can you please give good reasons why we should put resources in thisIMO rather scarce problem?Thx.Well, this makes open office not usable on MFS. And that means thatthere's no suitable technology for SSI-like linux system based oncluster of linux workstations as major (only) office software will notwork on this system. The only solution of this problem withoutmodification of Open Office code I can see is usage of NFS forhomespace and this will run slower. I'm afraid I cannot give betterreason then this. Any way if you will decide that this problem is not worth you effort,why not put into documentation/release notes that Open Office is notMFS compatible?Hi Evgeniy,Well, at least I haven't ever heard of a MFS filesystem, and probablyothers as well. That might be the reason why it's not mentioned at all.But back to the facts. The reason why this happens at all, is that the'fs_type' returned by 'statfs()' is not recognized as a 'remote' file-system like NFS. In case it would have been recognized as such, thecode involved would have switched back to 'read()' / 'write()' systemcalls instead of 'mmap()'.I have no proper solution for now, but I'll take this issue. And thanksfor the detailed diagnose, that saves the debugging stage for me.MatthiasReassigning to myself.Module 'ucb/store' doesn't recognize MFS (MOSIX File System) as remote.Look at 'fs_type' check in 'porting/sal/osl/unx/file.c', function'osl_getVolumeInformation', which currently recognizes NFS and SMB asremote via their respective superblock magic numbers.Well, I've got the idea, nice that it can be corrected.Two ways, either I patch MFS statfs call to pretend to be NFS, but this is potentially dangerous. So better to patch Office code, the magic number for MFS is:statfs.f_type=235466776 Meanwhile I can try to set the same handling as for NFS in 'porting/sal/osl/unx/file.c', function 'osl_getVolumeInformation' and test it.Silly question, where do I get the sources of the stable 1.0.0 release? I don't want to deal with snapshots as there can be other buggies :@)EvgeniyHi Evgeniy,Thanks for the 'magic' number.Silly, or not, a link to download the source is in the left navbar onthe main web page: Downloads - Application / Source / Developer.If you haven't compiled the source before, you probably need to be warnedthat OpenOffice.org is quite large. But you only need to build up to the'sal' project, which happens to one of the lowest level modules.Good luck,MatthiasHi Hennes,Reassigning to you, as discussed.Should go into OOo 1.0.1, if possible.Thanks,MatthiasAccepted.Added magic number for Mosix file system to /sal/osl/unx/file.c.51.2.8. Committed to branch OOO_STABLE_1.Hi,The bug is still there in 1.0.1 though there is some code in source infile.c to handle MFS, If I install a binary, I still get the same crush.??RegardsEvgeniyremoved keyword "ooo1.0" in favour of a target milestone "OOo 1.0.2".Don't have further informations needed to fix the bug..is this still an issue ?mav: Please take over..

id=13408	When adding an arrow to a circle arc and horizontally flipping it, it flips thearrow too (so that the arrow continues to turn in the same way). I'm not surethis is the desired behavior. This is reproduceable in 1.1.beta and in a current internal version.Set to new.Reassigned to Armin. Please, have a look.AW: I am taking a look. I am pretty sure i know where the problem is, we will see...AW: Yes, this is a known weakness. Problem is in svdocirc.cxx that the original implementor did not want to exchange the LineStart/LineEnd items when object is mirrored since if this is done that items get hard attributes which is not wanted. There are several solution possibilities. Main problem here is to keep compatible to all existing binary files (where that state is not saved). This issue will be addressed in one of the next versions.This is also reproducible on Win XP, OOo 3.2.1(In reply to)...and also in AOOo 3.4. Didn't you say "This issue will be addressed in one of the next versions", nine years ago? Why is this "RESOLVED INVALID", then?ALG: Yes, i did. Needed for this are real transformations which in ongoing work on aw080. That again I hope to get into versions after 3.4 asap (actively working on it currently). Sorry for the delay...I just wanted to give this issue "life again" :)This is not a vital issue for anyone (comprending me), but AFAIK "RESOLVED INVALID" means "this is not a bug", thus I just wanted to bring attention here again ;)Delay isn't a trouble for a minor issue, if it's not dead...Let's keep it open then, while waiting for aw080 to be integrated (no hurry) and for the many other benefits this integration will bring.Hi,Can you provide more information on the issue and the necessary steps needed to replicate the bug?Thanks in advance,Jose Miranda11/14/13(I'm using the Italian version, I'm guessing the English labels in the GUI)Hi Jose,I'm attaching a Writer document with a single arc, inserted by (an hidden-by-default button of) Draw toolbar, and added an arrow on its upper right end by using the sidebar.Select it and, in "Format" menu, choose Flip -> Flip horizontally.The arrow is now on the bottom, instead of the top.An analogous thing happens if you flip it vertically: you expect the arrow to move to the bottom, but it's moved to the left.I figure out the same happens in Draw documents, but at the moment I can't remember where to find the "Arc" tool.CreatedExample ODTALG: As described inand 7 this will be solved with aw080 which is ongoing. With the current core, the circles cannot really be 'mirrored', but mirroring is applied to start and end angles without changing polygon orientation. The reason for that again is that hard attributing line start and end (what would be needed) will make these objects no longer listen to the styles, thus no good solution before aw080.

In these cases the * my be omitted.So* matches all.*.myclass is equivalent to .myclass*#myId is equivalent to #myID(In reply to Armin Le Grand from)Yes, both rect elements match the * selector, but the first one gets its actual stroke and fill colors from the ID-selector rule, because that is more specific. The second rect element gets its stroke-width from the * selector, because css has precedence over svg attribute.(In reply to Armin Le Grand from)There are several * selectors per file possible, same as for other selectors.Hi Regina, thanks so far. I will also need to add support for*.myclass is equivalent to .myclass*#myId is equivalent to #myIDor in short: When no '*' alone, delete it.Should this not be only one standalone '*' one?

The drag is initiated but the drop never takes place and the AcceptDrop() method of the edit window is never called.Adding the flavor application/x-openoffice-internal fixes this bug. Previously this was the only flavor used for drag-and-drop of the table column.I still have to understand why exactly the drag-and-drop operation is aborted.CreatedAdd additional data flavor application/x-openoffice-internalAdd the application/x-openoffice-internal data flavor always when no system flavor is part of the transferable.First tests showed no problems with other drag-and-drop operations but an exhaustive test of all combinations of drag sources and drop targets is nearly impossible.I dug a little deeper. Here is what I found out.The aqua DropTarget class in its initialize() method registers the set of data flavors it wants to be called for by the system, when a drag-and-drop operation is active that supports at least one these data flavors. This set consists of what DataFlavorMapper::getAllSupportedPboardTypes() returns plus NSFilenamesPboardType.When the transferable does not contain any of the registered flavors then the DropTarget is never called.The attached patch works because it adds one of the registered flavors to every transferable that does not yet have any registered flavor. Once the transferable is accepted and is dropped on a receiver (drop target) the other, not registered, flavors can be used to extract information that then is pasted."af" committed SVNinto trunk:#i120481# Add registered transferable flavor to make the Writer acceptChecked in the patch.verified on the build aoo3.5_r1378446Hello,MacOsX 10.8.2No fixed with 3.4.1 !

I see the error already in OOo1.1.5.It might be connected to.I have reduced "Importance", because AOO do not write such files, and authors who work directly on the file format, can add an additional M0 0 command to workaround the problem.Grepping, will have a look ASAP...Checked the svg:d parser, all works well there. Problem is not the svg:d, but how it is used in our model.A SdrPathObj cannot be smaller/bigger than the contained polygon, so the polygon *defines* the objects size.In your correction you have 'achieved' that by adding (0,0) as a first, one-point polygon, so the SdrPathObj contains a PolyPolygon made up of two polys, the 1st with just one point.The svg:d we write (and read) is the unified PolyPolygon plus scaling (due to the fromer core need that integers are used in-between, thus unit coordinates [0.0 .. 1.0] would have been lost).This automatically means that it will always have a bounding box containing a minimum X and Y being 0.0.That is the reason that our viewBoxes always start with two zeros and have the size of the boundrect of the contained polygon.To be honest, I have no clue why ODF uses a viewBox at all; the only adaption that is made is at load time (see SdXMLPathShapeContext::StartElementline 1517) is to scale the polygon from the viewBox range to a range constructed by viewBox x,y (so the same) and the loaded object size (svg:width and svg:height). This would allow a scaling of the defined polygon (by svg:width/viewBox:width in x and svg:height/viewBox:height in y), but *no translation* of it, since minX and minY for both rabnges are defined equal, so even when using values different from zero in viewBox:x and y nothing would happen. This has been like this in all AOO versions and cannot be changed in the installed versions.The true bound rect of the imported PolyPolygon is not used currently at all. Thus, the viewBox usage in ODF has nothing to do with the intention of this statement in svg, I would have not added it initially at all, it makes things just more complicated here.So, whoever writes these files, please tell them- the polygons have to be unified, but scaled (no mirror (aka no negative scale), no shear, no rotation, no translation)- thus, the bound rect of this will have a minX/minY of 0.0- the viewBox should have a x,y of 0.0 and a width/height identical to svg:width and svg:height- the rest of the object transform should move to (a) when not rotated, mirrored sheared: svg:x, svg:y for translation (b) else, do not use svg:x, svg:y (or set to zero) and use the draw:transform to define the full transformation, starting from the unified, scaled polygon, so scale is already in the polygon, but mirror is not. Thus, when mirrored, the transformation has to start with a scale in x and/or y of -1.0.Adding a 'M0 0' is *no* correction to be advised; as explained, this will create a PolyPolygon which looks nice, but 'artificially' expands the SdrPathObj shape. We had something similar with one of the CustomShapes, and this was leading to problems, e.g. in slideshow this single point polygons were painted and visible, do not do that please.All in all there is no error in the svg:d reader, but there are limitations in the usage of viewBox in odf that the original inventors left behind for us, without clearly specifying what intentions they had for viewBox at all. As said, the viewBox intention of svg - to scale some content somewhere and leaving white space somehere between object and content - is not even possible with the SdrPathObj in our model implementation (and makes no sense - why should a object have a size different from the bounding box of its content?).I do not find, where the bezier curve is shifted, so that its bound rectangle starts in svg:x, svg:y. I have looked through \xmloff\source\draw\ximpshap.cxx, but in SdXMLPathShapeContext::StartElement in line#1583 the variable aSourcePolyPolygon still has the absolute values in regard to the page as it would be for a svg-element.I see the conflict between the way, that the bounding box of a path element is aligned with the svg:x, svg:y position (draw-interpretation), and the demand, that the M command in the path is honored (svg-interpretation).But I see no reason, why not use the svg-interpretation on import and change position. This does not effect old documents, because the values were written in a way, that the svg-position interpretation results in the same position as the draw:path interpretation, and using the UI it is not possible to get such M command. It makes it possible to write paths directly, without the need to calculate bounding boxes manually. You are right, that the clipping properties of svg:viewBox in svg-graphics is not used in draw:path elements. But why not use the coordinate transformation given by svg:viewBox? I think, that this was the intention in the specification, to fit the unit-less svg:d values to the svg:x, svg:y, svg:width, and svg:height values by an implicit linear transformation. AOO core interprets it as 100th mm, but that is not mentioned in any place in the specification (as far as I know).CreatedMisinterpretation Bezier Curve (with "M 0 0 " in start of path) - "Content.xml" only.CreatedODG file with problems with Bezier CurvesThis file contains Bezier Curves misinterpretated.A prefix "M 0 0 " at start of the path not has been omitted.All lines with "00_Epures" uses control point coordinates of each Bezier arc, sames as Bezier curves, and are correctly intrerpreted.Additionally, this ODG is successfully repaired during loading.The good method for drawing Bezier uses the following steps:// ViewBox must be used // Steps: // 1 - Calculate viewbox parameters // -- Find maxi et mini of the points control // --> obtaining ViewBoxX, ViewBoxY, ViewBoxL, ViewBoxH // 2 - Translate all points with tx = -ViewBoxX et ty = -ViewBoxY // 3 - Draw curve with avec svg:x="<ViewBoxX>", // svg:y="<ViewBoxY>", // svg:width="<ViewBoxL>", // svg:height="<ViewBoxH>", // svg:viewBox="0, 0, <ViewBoxL>, <ViewBoxH>",See the following code========================procedure Todg.DessinPolyBezier(const QStyle: string; var BezierArcs: array of TBezierArc; const QClosed, QFilled: boolean);const FM1 = '%.0f, %.0f '; var ViewBoxX, ViewBoxY, ViewBoxL, ViewBoxH: TScalaire; BB_X1, BB_Y1, BB_X2, BB_Y2: TScalaire; Qx1, Qy1, Qx2, Qy2: TScalaire; i:integer; coords: String; sname: String; EWE: TBezierArc; WU: String; // translater les arcs pour les mettre dans la ViewBox procedure TranslaterArcs; var BBCx1, BBCy1, BBCx2, BBCy2 : TScalaire; MonArc: TBezierArc; A: Integer; procedure Miou(const qx, qy: TScalaire); begin BBCx1 := min(qx, BBCx1); BBCx2 := max(qx, BBCx2); BBCy1 := min(qy, BBCy1); BBCy2 := max(qy, BBCy2); end; begin // Etape 1: Calcul des min/max BBCx1 := +BIGMAX; BBCy1 := +BIGMAX; BBCx2 := -BIGMAX; BBCy2 := -BIGMAX; for A := 0 to High(BezierArcs) do begin MonArc := BezierArcs[A]; Miou(MonArc.P1.X, MonArc.P1.y); Miou(MonArc.PC1.X, MonArc.PC1.y); Miou(MonArc.PC2.X, MonArc.PC2.y); Miou(MonArc.P2.X, MonArc.P2.y); end; // Etape 2: Paramétrage des viexbox ViewBoxX := BBCx1; ViewBoxY := BBCy1; ViewBoxL := BBCx2 - BBCx1; ViewBoxH := BBCy2 - BBCy1; // Etape 3: Translation for A := 0 to High(BezierArcs) do begin MonArc := BezierArcs[A]; MonArc.P1.X := MonArc.P1.X - ViewBoxX; MonArc.P1.Y := MonArc.P1.Y - ViewBoxY; MonArc.PC1.X := MonArc.PC1.X - ViewBoxX; MonArc.PC1.Y := MonArc.PC1.Y - ViewBoxY; MonArc.PC2.X := MonArc.PC2.X - ViewBoxX; MonArc.PC2.Y := MonArc.PC2.Y - ViewBoxY; MonArc.P2.X := MonArc.P2.X - ViewBoxX; MonArc.P2.Y := MonArc.P2.Y - ViewBoxY; BezierArcs[A] := MonArc; end; end; procedure DrawArc2(var QCoords: string; const BA: TBezierArc; const Idx: integer); begin if (Idx = 0) then QCoords += Format('M ' + FM1, [BA.P1.X, BA.P1.Y]); QCoords += Format('C ' + FM1, [BA.PC1.X, BA.PC1.Y]); QCoords += Format(FM1, [BA.PC2.X, BA.PC2.Y]); QCoords += Format(FMT_2V_CMM, [BA.P2.X, BA.P2.Y]); end;Begin Inc(FNbCourbesBeziers); // Pour dessiner un Polybezier, il est nécessaire d'utiliser ViewBox // Etapes: // 1 - Calculer les paramètres de la viewbox // -- Rechercher les maxi et mini des points de controle // --> on obtient ViewBoxX, ViewBoxY, ViewBoxL, ViewBoxH // 2 - Translater les points avec tx = -ViewBoxX et ty = -ViewBoxY // 3 - Tracer la courbe avec svg:x="<ViewBoxX>", // svg:y="<ViewBoxY>", // svg:width="<ViewBoxL>", // svg:height="<ViewBoxH>", // svg:viewBox="0, 0, <ViewBoxL>, <ViewBoxH>", // calcul des translations TranslaterArcs; // composition du texte à passer en paramètre de path="" if (QFilled) then coords := 'M 0 0 Z ' // tout polygone (ou courbe) rempli est encadré de deux Z en début et en fin de chemin else coords := 'M 0 0 '; // Le Z de tête indique que l'objet est rempli // Le Z de queue indique qu'il est fermé // L'objet n'est rempli que s'il y a un Z de queue for i := 0 to High(BezierArcs) do begin EWE := BezierArcs[i]; DrawArc2(coords, EWE, i); end; // polygone fermé ? if (QClosed) then coords += 'z'; // début de la chaine de paramètres WU := ''; AddAttribute(WU, 'draw:style-name', QStyle, false); AddAttribute(WU, 'draw:name', Format('Polybezier%d', [FNbCourbesBeziers]),false); AddAttribute(WU, 'svg:x' , Format(FMT_CMM, [ViewBoxX]), false); AddAttribute(WU, 'svg:y' , Format(FMT_CMM, [ViewBoxY]), false); AddAttribute(WU, 'svg:width' , Format(FMT_CMM, [ViewBoxL]), false); AddAttribute(WU, 'svg:height' , Format(FMT_CMM, [ViewBoxH]), false); AddAttribute(WU, 'svg:viewBox' , Format(FMT_4V_CMM, [0.0, 0.0, ViewBoxL, ViewBoxH]), false); AddAttribute(WU, 'svg:d', coords, false); BeginSection(FPointerToFileContent, 5, 'draw:path', WU); WriteLnUTF8(FPointerToFileContent, StringOfChar(' ', 6 * 2) + '<text:p/>'); EndSection(FPointerToFileContent, 5, 'draw:path'); // move to last point for further painting with lineto DessinMoveTo(EWE.P2.x, EWE.P2.y); end;@Regina: You can find it starting at the four cases 'OWN_ATTR_BASE_GEOMETRY', two for bezier and two for non-bezier. These use SdrPathObj::TRGetBaseGeometry and SdrPathObj::TRSetBaseGeometry where on the latter you can read in the comment:// sets the base geometry of the object using infos contained in the homogen 3x3 matrix. // If it's an SdrPathObj it will use the provided geometry information. The Polygon has // to use (0,0) as upper left and will be scaled to the given size in the matrix.Thus, to write the polygon in the currently used form in ODF, you need two things:(a) the normalized, but scaled PolyPolygon [0.0 .. fabs(scale)] in X and Y(b) the complete transformationThe viewBox will then use the [0.0 .. fabs(scale)] range and the polygon will also use that form. This makes the PolyPolygon definition in the ODF independent of the transformation, except the scale which is there for historical reasons (already explained).There is one more caveat with beziers: the BoundRect and thus the scale used for the bezier is without the control points (also due to what the original implementors did). This makes the BoundRect unfortunately non-trivial to calculate since the bezier needs to be split at it's exreama points to getthe correct BoundRect. See getRange and getRangeWithControlPoints in basegfx for more info.History: When the integer polygons were used this was done by using a copy of the polygon converted to line segments, with the result that the BoundRect was always wrong by +-10 100thMM units since that adaptive subdivision is always only a approximation. Thus, the geometry changed slightly at each save/reload...Again: Please do *not* add a 'M 0 0', this will add extra geometry to the polygon which leads to other problems later. This was already done in other circumstances and is known to have its own problems.What you do when adding this is to make the polygon seemingly conform to the requirements by always giving it a minX and minY at (0,0), but thats not a good thing to do. Instead, the transformation and viewBox needs to be correctly adapted, e.g. for a polygon having a BoundRect with a MinX of 100 and a minY of 200 to really use that in the transformation ad viewBox. This is not done in the nitial examples and that is the problem there.@JP CASSOU: Looks pretty good, but as desribed above: The BoundRect needs to be the BoundRect of the curve without the control points, but including the extremas. This makes it not easy to calculate, but is what the initial implementors defined. To see how to do that, plesae refer to the module 'basegfx' of AOO, the classes B2DPolygon, B2dPolyPolygonn and the methods getRange and getRangeWithControlPoints there. These use a temporary split of the bezier at the exreamas to ensure the correct calculation of the BoundRect without the control points.HTH!taking over for verificationUnfortunately, I am not experienced enough to verify a possible fix.I am also not sure, if this issue has been fixed as I did not see any code changes.Can somebody please clarify the status of this issue? Thx in advance.No, it has not been fixed. It is not even clear where to fix it, because changes in SdrPathObj::TRGetBaseGeometry and SdrPathObj::TRSetBaseGeometry would have deep impacts and solutions might be different for AW080, and such cases only come from foreign application or manual manipulations. Please ask Armin.There is nothing to fix currently, all works well in AOO (and others based on that code do probably still the same). This task is about clarification what exactly is currently done when representing polygon shapes in ODF to allow others more easy to also use this shape type. Of course aw080 will do some stuff differently, but will in principle keep the pair of normalized, scale dpolyfon and transformation. It cannot be changed in existing files and to keep compatible it should not. There is also no reason for a change it works as intended (by the original implementors, of course).To make things more clear, another explanation (hopefully simpler):The representation of a draw shape containing a path in ODF format uses basically two objects:(a) The DrawObject itself containing the object transformation, either as x,y,width,height or as transformation if more aspects as translate and shear are used.It has to be split to x,y and a transformation part when mirror x/y (negative scales), rotation or shear is used. This is because:The object transformation is seen as the transformation from object unit coordinates (the object is at 0,0 and has size 1,1) to the target transformation; the x,y represents the translation, the width,height the scale. There is a logical order in which the aspects are applied:- scale- mirror- shear- rotate- translateThis comes from simple considerations; scaling only works as long as the object is at (0,0); shear and rotate has to be done around top-left, so this has to be (0,0); shear defines the relation between the X and Y axes, thus is only useful before rotation.In ODF when x,y, width, height and transformation would be used the order of applying to builtd the whole object transformation would be: scale width/height, move x,y, apply transformation. The problem here is that translation would be added *before* the transformation which contains evtl. rotation/shear. To solve this, x,y has to be 0 in those cases and the translation part has to be moved to ODFs transformation part to apply it after the roation/shear parts.(b) the path geometry. This is in principle the path geometry in object unit coordinates (the object is at 0,0 and has size 1,1). For historical reasons (integer transport) the scale is included, so path data has a bound rect of (0, 0, width, height). This also defines that the path geometry always has a minX and minY of 0.Imagine the path geometry being transformed by first removing it's own scaling again and then applying the complete object transformation (see (a)).The viewBox part of this then also has a x,y of 0, thus this is practically not used in ODF. The only part of viewBox that is used is the width/height part. If this is different from the objects (a) width,height a scaling will be applied to the path geometry.The BoundRect used from the path geometry is *without* control points for historical reasons; to calculate this see tipps in comments above. Do *not* simply build the BoundRect including the control points if a bezier is used (!)I hope this makes the relationships clearer and why viewBox is a not needed part in ODF for path objects at all.Some additions: (a) is pretty much the same for all draw objects represented in ODF. The need to add stuff of the complete object transformation happens in two cases, so with the 'normal' case that there is just scale and transformation (without mirroring) there are three:(1) transformation has scale without mirror (positive in X and Y) and translation: AOO will use svg:x, svg:y, svg:width and svg:height, no transformation will be written(2) transformation uses mirror (scale X and/or Y is negative; addon: when X and Y is negative, it's equal to a 180 deg rotation, rotation is preferred): AOO will use svg:width and svg:height for scale (in absolute values since svg does not allow negative values for these), svg:x and svg:y will not be used (or zero), a transformation containing mirror (scale -1 in X or Y) and the translation (which would have been in svg:x and svg:y)(3) transformation uses mirror, and/or shearX (shearY also possible, but can be expressed as rotation 90 deg and shearX combination, so shearX is preferred) and/or rotation: AOO will use svg:width and svg:height for scale absolute values, svg:x and svg:y will not be used (or zero), a transformation containing mirror (scale -1 in X or Y), shearX, rotation and the translation (which would have been in svg:x and svg:y)For paths, (b) is simply to be seen as an addon carrying the path data in normalized object coordinates (plus the exception with the positive scale). In normalized object coordinates to have this data as independent from the object as possible (added zoom for historical reasons is the exception here).

The pasted GDI image is right next to the original copied table.Had the same issue before upgrading from OO 3 to OO 4, but usually repeating the copy/paste commands would copy the whole thing eventually... p.s. the behaviour is exactly the same when pasting the table to other OO apps; verified in Writer and Draw.Copy from Calc and paste in Draw is truncated.Rev. 1525015 Win 7Confirmed also in AOO401m5(Build:9714) - Rev. 15249582013-09-20 11:54 - Linux x86_64ALG: First check: Paste special/as Bitmap does paste all, the last two columns get not clipped.

There, the PageSize is taken, multiplied by 2 (comment is: 'limit OLE object to double of page size') and then the visible size is calculated and set using SetVisArea.

But it seems possible to add a parameter to ScTransferObj::InitDocShell() to define if the value for SetVisArea shall be limited in relation to PageSize or not.

id=33336	At the moment the previwe window in draw has only a limited benefit. It would bepossible to have this window for navigating in the document. Asmall frame in thepreview could show the current zoomed area in the complete document. Shiftingthis frame would shift the current view on the document.

id=110506	The previous version of OOO 3.2 that I was using (I am not sure which build) hadproblems with 3D objects displaying and copying correctly, but I used themanyway. I assume some changes were made to the code handling these objects. Aside effect of these assumed changes is that at least one of the objectinteractions that worked before no longer work. At least the "Go to page orobject:xxx" interaction is broken. Please attach a document to reproduce. Did you use the version 3.1.1 before?Created2 slides that should interact but do notI am no longer sure what version I was using before. I thought and reportedthat it was 3.2. However, when I choose Start->All Programs I see an emptyOpenOffice.org 3.1 folder that I used to use and a new OpenOffice.org 3.2 folderthat has the newer version. I suggest it is safe to assume I was using 3.1 before.In the attached file, there are 2 slides out of about 100 that I had workinginteractions for. Each of the 3D triangular objects in the lower half representbuttons. Press one (in particular the yellow one) and a new slide should appear(in particular, the next slide.) The interaction that used to be there (Go topage or object SetupDsp) is no longer there. In addition, I cannot add a newone nor replace the one that should be there.I cannot confirm this on Solaris x86. Interactions work well. Tested withOOO320_m14 and I cannot confirm this on Windows using OOo 3.2.0 release buildprovided by SunI am a little confused.I uninstalled the m12 build I was using and again downloaded the build providedby the OO.org website for Windows. The Help-About information confirms thebuild is m12 provided by Sun. The problem I have described is still present.ja indicates that the problem cannot be confirmed on Solaris x86, build m14. Onthe surface, it seems the test was done on a different operating system with adifferent build. Yet the comment also says the problem cannot be confirmed onWindows using the release build provided by Sun. Was the confirmation testperformed using build m12 on Windows XP, or was it done on Solaris using build m14?I can contribute additional information:To continue using my slides as I wish, I "uninstalled" 3.2 and reinstalled 3.1. Trying to open the file directly caused OO to crash and the recovery processdid not work. Opening OO then opening the odp file allows me to see the slidesbut all interaction is missing. But at least now I can recreate theinteractions whereas in 3.2 I could not do even that. This suggests to me thereis something about storing the interactions in the file that is messed up.I have loaded your file in version 2.11, 3.0., 3.1.1 and 3.2 and in none of themthere is a target assigned. The interaction is assigned but without a target.I loaded the file in 3.1.1 again, assigned an interaction and saved it. Loadingit in 3.2 and m75 shows me no interaction target. Additional the selection ofthe 3d object is not possible using the mouse. TAB helps to select it.@kerryober: is that why you could not assign an interaction?Reassigned.It is true that the file I sent you does not have any interactions. I believethis is true because 3.2 destroyed them. (But I may be wrong, see my previouscomment.) I tried to add an interaction using 3.2 but could not. The purposeof the file was to provide a case where interactions that existed in 3.1 do notwork in 3.2. Each of the 3D "buttons" in the main slide had a "Go to"interaction in 3.1. I only included the slide for the yellow button "Go to" inthe file. I can provide others if you want/need.When I used 3.2 on the file I sent you I did not have any problems that Inoticed using the mouse to select any of the 3D objects. I could select anobject with a left click, open the object menu with a right click, selectInteraction from the menu to display the interaction dialog, choose the "Go toobject or page:" action, select a page from the list, and click OK. However,performing those actions did not create/store an interaction.I should make it clear that 2D interactions still work in 3.2 (I use some ofthose too) so the issue is 3D object related only.this is a dupe I already fixed it some time ago. please check OOo 3.2.1 versionclosingI downloaded 3.2.1 fromand installed it on mymachine. The problem as described is still present.I notice that I do not even get the option to try to create an interaction in3.2.1 as I could in 3.2 (which did not work) and in 3.1. From a userperspective this problem is getting worse, not better.
id=68585	Unfortunately, while the bug in i67013 was fixed, the fix seems to have causedanother focusing-problem, which causes the context-menu to stay open in another testcase. Attached: a testcase which shows the problem. Happens both under Linux and Solaris. Reminder Fredrikh: Remove workaround when task is fixed. CreatedTesttool-scriptCorrection; this is a "Solaris only"-bug. The problem is that the context menuis open when the testtool tries to close the document, which results in an errormessage.adjusted title accordinglypl->gh: I'm not sure how this is supposed to work. As far as i can see, the"gMouseClick" statement of the script will be evaluated inautomation/source/server/statemnt.cxx and basically calls the Click method of awindow. However the popup menus are closed in the window frame proc (how systemevents get evaluated). The correct method to post mouse events would IMHO beApplication::PostMouseEvent. However that one is asynchronous which might be whyit is not used in automation ? The solution could be a synchronous"CallMouseEvent" on Application; however my first naive try to simply makePostMouseEvent synchronous failed miserably.I don't know who closes the popups in most cases, but it is not the click eventas far as i can see.Please advise.this problem has nothing to do with the fix of i67013 as it is also in m177the correct method to close a menu without selecting anything is menuselect 0which I tried and it workedto PL: it is planned to switch to Application::PostMouseEvent (andApplication::PostKeyEvent) soon but thorrough testing has to be done (scheduledfor XMas 2006).Directly after i67013 was fixed, several tests failed due to context-menus which stayed open, where they earlier without any menuselect (0) had closed. The workaround is, as you mention a menuselect (0), but since this wasn't needed before i67013 was fixed, I see this as a regression.Set target milestone to 2.2Reopening this issue. It is neither resolved nor invalid.Furthermore, MenuSelect(0) is not a valid call because slot 0 is not a validslot. It leads to a crash with shells that do not support any slots. Theseshells have to provide at least one entry in their slot map. This by default isone for slot 0, which is an invalid id that must not be dispatched.

id=71486	Reading other discussions I got the idea that a default disappearing mouse waschosen for Impress presetations, but that you could choose to have it visiblewith the corresponding presentation option.However I have to reset this option everytime I open the file, since the choiceis not saved with the file. This is of course unfortunate, since I often forgetto switch it on beforer starting a presentation.The "mouse visible" is an important property when using presentations asuniversity lectures in quantitative sciences like I do, as it is frequentlynecessary to point at specific formulas or passages in a slide while discussing it.Thanks for the attention, Andrea Prio changed, reassigned.set to new and change the target.I can reproduce the bug.Please have a look.I do not accept this as a bug, it works as designed.Having the mouse cursor visible during a slideshow depends on the hardwaresetting where you hold the slideshow. Therefore it depends on the hardware OOois installed on. F.e. in one setting you use a large beamer and need the mouseto show things on screen, in another setting you use a smaller display and canpoint out things with your finger, so you don't need the mouse button.I see your point, but if we change this there will be other people who willargue "I don't want to see that mouse pointer during slideshow, each time I geta new presentation I have to change this"closingI am sorry to bother again, but sincerely I have difficulties in grasping themeaning of the last post by cl. I beg you PLEASE have a look at what follows.FIRST point: the "mouse visibile during presentation" property is a local, individual fileproperty, right? I mean, it is NOT an application general property that you setonce and stays the same for any file you open, right? At least it SHOULD be,since (as you correctly point out) not all presentations are shown on the same"hardware" and context, so it is perfectly reasonable to desire a visible mousefor your interactive lecture but not for you open distance presentation wheremouse should not be there.SECOND point: I am certainly not pretending that the property is set "on" as default - let itstay off as default, no problem. What I find very reasonable is that if a userwants it to be "on" as default for a certain presentation, this can be set andremembered by the file. What happens with my interactive presentations now isthat I usually rush into the classroom and start the presentation forgettingabout mouse visibility, and then I have to stop it, go set the property and thenrestart it when I realize the mouse is not permanently visible!IF - but only if - the property is actually an application property and it ispositively impossible to turn it into a specific file property (since thesetting is never saved it is not possible to understand which of the two istrue), then let it "OFF" by default, but let the user set it "on" permanently ifhe wants to. This is of course second best to having a specific file property.However I cannot see how a user that does never want the mouse visible couldprotest: if he never switches it "on" he will never even know the possibility isthere.If you do not find all of the above sensible, then perhaps I am missing something.Lastly - I know the rule "one problem, one issue", but let me say that the"mouse as pen" option could benefit form a rethinking: the "pen" icon is way TOOsmall, almost invisible; the color, transparency and width of the mark you drawshould be user-choosable (the present green is very light and the width isreally narrow); the line drawn is too irregular since it is mirrors the phisicalmouse movement: it should be possible to apply some kind of automatic smootherto the line you draw. I never use the option as it is now but would instead if Icould configure it as above.Thanks again for listening,set target from 2.x to 3.x according to
id=118919	Similar toalso the internal module main/writerperfect has an incompatible license. On a second thought the module has been contributed to OpenOffice.org via the SCA, from where its files have been granted to the Apache Foundation via the SGA-2 so it is ready to be relicensed under the ALv2.Solved by Andrew with.@hdu (or anyone who knows): Could you clarify the status of main/writerperfect? I was ready to remove the directory now, based on the fact that it is unused, see also(and I actually verified that a normal build does not need the main/writerperfect directory, so it can simply be removed).But does your comment above mean that we can keep it? (In that case, then it would be better to use it)(In reply to Andrea Pescetti from)Looking at --Why were some items relicensed and others not?"pescetti" committed SVNinto trunk:#i118919# Remove main/writerperfect (currently unused).In the end I removed main/writerperfect since it's unused and I prefer to be on the safe side. But if the discussion in this issue had resolved in favor of keeping it, I can surely restore it. So I'm not closign the issue, pending clarifications.

For example, another bug is that when the clipboard contains a picture that can't be inserted, the paste button on the panel is disabled (this is right), but the menu item Paste in the Edit menu is still enabled. Somehow, the buttons on the panel and the menu items are not synchronized, it seems. Remember that Copy and Cut buttons don't work too in Basic IDE.IMHO, all these bugs could be fixed together with this and similar bugs as a whole:* The menu Repeat (Ctrl Shift Y) is always disabled.* The Ctrl C shortcut works irrelatively to the Copy menu item state. Even if nothing is selected, Ctrl C will copy empty string to clipboard.The document needs to be saved, or exist, then the buttons are activated, ok another bug.Somehow I missed that, while testing this in the cws.The whole undo/redo machanism in basic is not that optimal, but that would also be another bug.dev300m106 - the buttons Undo and Redo are unusable.

Inter-word spacing: Reduced maximal by [0Â·0em] Extended maximal by[1em|Auto|None]2. Intra-word spacing: Reduced maximal by [0Â·0em] Extended maximal by[0Â·2em|Auto|None]Per default the inter-word spacing should at least 3 times wider than theintra-word spacing.

id=1753	A picture is worth a thousand words, so I sent in a screenshot of my enhancement request ( cursorbug.png ).Here is how to duplicate the issue: 1. Create a table. 2. Resize the table so that the right table boundary is less than the width of the page. 3. Click on the rightmost column in the table. 4. Move the right indent marker beyond the right table boundary. 5. Enter text until it goes past the right table boundary.The cursor keeps moving past the table edge but the user does not see any of the text that is entered. In Microsoft Word 2000, when you move past the right table edge the cursor disappears until the text wraps onto the next line.Granted, I'm not saying you should copy everything Microsoft does, but this behaviour where the cursor keeps moving without the text displaying is weird. Users might get confused when this issue happens.As a compromise, when the user exceeds the table edge, perhaps you could display the text in a "greyed out" font until it wraps around to the next line.I'm not sure if this should be classified as a bug or an enhancement. CreatedScreenshot of the issue(Mis)using features other people are happy to have "without limits", one always finds a way to mess up a document (i.e. so that some text is not visible) Therefore I see this as an enhancement.Reassigned to Falko.Hi Frank, what do you think about this behaviour? RFE or Bug?This is a general problem with indents in SO (in frames, on a normalpage). I guess that our current ruler implementation does not coverthose issues.There are several problems with the current ruler implementation.(i.e.you can drop te right indent over the left indent)Fl: Back to you for decissionThis issue is re-assigned to Christian Jansen for further evaluation.We should fix this issue, because the current behavior with thevisible cursor in a non editable area makes no sense.can reproduce in AOO3.5_r1400796Reproduced on Windows 7 using OO 4.0.1I agree this should be fixed so that text in the table remains visible.Tyler Charles 09/23/2014I successfully duplicated the issue, by following the provided instructions. As long as the right indent marker is positioned to the right of the table boundary the text will continue to be inserted until it reaches the indent marker and wraps around to the second line of the table column. A simpler set of steps to replicate this issue would be: 1. Create a table. 4. Move the right indent marker beyond the right table boundary. 5. Enter text in the right table column until it goes past the right table boundary.
id=2313	Especially resizing ! It is quite noticable how easy images are to manage in Word as opposed to Open Office.Two examples:1) Word appears to Anchor as Character by default so importing two images places them one after the other is some fashion (side by side or one below the other). Open Office by contrast defaults to Anchor to Page which means that importing two, or more, images results in them all sitting on top of each other !2) Dragging the left or right hand image resizing widget in Word 2000 automatically takes care of the margins. (Well that's not quite true ! Dragging to the left results in the right hand margin getting smaller or vanishing off the page altogether. The left margin then has to be move to the left !) In Open Office the maximum image size is fixed firmly to the current margin / page size. Messing about with the margins can lead to all sorts of fun and games ! Reassigned to Falko.This issue is re-assigned to Christian Jansen for further evaluation.1. Word users don't have the choice to place the anchor of an objectto different items like page, paragraphs etc. The problem with anchorsis that every default has a lot of pros and cons. Anyway, may weshould invest some time to evaluate a better solution.2. A soultion could be to handle graphics like in DTP applications.Graphics in those apps are placed in frames and could be resized,dragged or what ever real easy. The solution from MS even not realeasy to handle.I am in strong agreement with point 2 in CJ's comments. For OOo to be able tohandle images in a similar way to, say, QuarkXPress would be a massive bonus forthose of us who do use OOo as a DTP package.Or, if this already exists / is available via a practical workaround, it needsto be better signposted.CJ: Reopened. Set target to Later.Tyler Charles 09/23/2014I successfully recreated this issue by uploading multiple images into a word document. I noticed tat the images are placed on top of each other when uploaded together, but when uploaded separately the second image in placed in a new document separate from the first image. Uploading multiple images to a single document becomes tedious when the user has to manually resize and reposition each individual image in the document.

Caolan McNamara has said that reverse engineering Visio would be veryvery unpleasant (and he should know he reverse enigineered theMicrosoft Word format).

MSDN is giving more support to develop around .vxd than .vsd :-)document (word 2000).In that case perhaps you would consider marking this as a duplicate ofOr if you want to leave this open as a seperate bug, you might want toclarify, perhaps change the summary to include the ".vxd" or "VisioXML".

There is a general problem that no equation fields are imported from any version of Word to any version of Writer on Windows.***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***Reassigend to MRU.CreatedSmaple of formula field in Ms WordWriter does not support formula fields like in the attached sample.I see two different solutions for this.1. implement such a feature in Writer2. converting the field to a StarMath objectConverting the fields one by one in the document is not a solution (insome documents I have hundreds of such fields!).Needed is the implementing of equation fields.I totally disagree the need of implementation of equation fields in Writer. I'm the author of aMath (, a MS Word template facilitatingthe creation of math texts used by a great number of math teachers) and have agreat experience of these fields. The equation fields in MS Word are only alegacy feature that is fast and easily scriptable but doesn't provide a lot offeatures. Oo Math component is far better and MS Word equation fields should beconverted to Oo Math. The difficulty is that MS Word equation fields are oftenused with custom constructs like "\s\up2(\f(3;5))" to have the fraction 3/5moved up for a better aligment. The ideal import solution would give thepossibility to configure how equation are transformed from equation fields toMath formula for instance using a set of regexp: in this case"\\s\\up2(\\f\((.*);(,*)\)\)" to "$1 over $2".Why is this issue marked as fixed as it is not the case?Again: why is it marked as fixed/resolved as it isn't the case?I've had a look at the filter's source code. It seems that only to types ofequation fields are converted: combined characters like \o(\s\up Y(XXX),\s\doY(XXX)) and ruby text (?) other kinds of equations are simply ignored.What about importing them as hidden text? This would give people having customeq fields in Word, the posibility to write a macro converting their Word EQfields to whatever they want.I completely agree with mguillem. This IS an issue. I reported it more than twoyears ago, and it is absolutely not fixed. For that reason, it is not possibleto say that OOo is compatible with MS Word because it is not true. I have all mywork (hundreds of hours) wrote with MS equation fields and I can't use OOo forthat reason. To fix this for my own use I wrote (two years ago) a MS macro toconvert MS equation fields into text. I thought then import this into OOo andwrite a macro in OOo language to convert into OOo equations.

id=14934	Hi,I would like the ability to clear the Load URL history list and feel this should be easily available to the user via the UI. Eg right click and clear for example.As a consultant I have seen many people wanting to clear their browser history list because of inappropriate URL's and I have had to show them how to clear the history.OO does not appear to provide the user with the ability to do this.In my own case I have wanted to explore this feature further. What order are the files listed, are passwords kept in the history etc.Without the ability to easily clear the list it is too hard to get a handle on what is happening in the feature.By the way I think the feature is really good, but I doubt that many other people care about it until they are shown what it can do.ThanksKelvin Reassigned to Bettina.I thought I would update the OOo release on old issues if still relevant.Changing platform, OS, version and confirming.Can confirm also with 680m36.Hi Kelvin,change the common.xcu by hand is a thing that is not intended to users.I know a lot of people that are afraid of to change these things, some areunable to do this.It souds like an easy thing to you, but is very annoyng.There are some things in user-faq talking about to change settings by hand, butis not a very good thing.I think that OOo should provide, at least, a list of things that you can do byediting some files by hand.***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***To grep the issues easier via "requirements" I put the issues currently lying onmy owner to the owner "requirements".Current version 4.0.1 has Clear entry to remove all entries from the Recent file list.

id=11559	I would appreciate if I could edit graphics (don't matter how) embeddedin an OOo document. This feature was present in staroffice 5, but was removedin staroffice 6. Do you plan to support such editing in the future? This could be achieved in the following way:1) In OOo Preferences the user defines any number (every graphic program has its own specific set of specialized featurs) of graphic editor programs by: Path, Name, ev. commandline parameters (e.g. '%1 -e').2) When the user in OOo [word processor] rightclicks any type of graphic (gif, bmp, png, jpg, etc.) the appearing context menu contains a menu item 'Edit [graphic type]' with submenu items: These submenu items are the names of the former defined graphic editor programs.3) Clicking one of the submenu items copies the graphic to a temporary directory. Then OOo [word processor] calls the resp. graphic program with the graphic file in the temp directory on the commandline (all graphic programs are able to open a file passed on the command line).4) The user then can edit the graphic in the graphic program and then save the graphic (in most graphic programs the default Save-command saves the file in the same format and same path as the graphic loaded on the command line).5) Because OOo [word processor] is monitoring the graphic file in the temp directory it notices when the graphic program saves the file, so after every file change the graphic embedded in the OOo [word processor] document is updated.6) When the user closes the graphic program (monitored by OOo) OOo deletes the temporary file in the temp directory.7) The user goes back to OOo [word processor] and finds his file edited without the time consuming hassle of having himself to save and load the graphic several times.reassigned to***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***To grep the issues easier via "requirements" I put the issues currently lying onmy owner to the owner "requirements".edit graphics possible.AOO410m14(Build:9760) - Rev. 1583418Rev.1583418Win 7(In reply to Edwin Sharp from)How do you *edit* an embedded picture like it was able in StarOffice 5?Have I overlooked a new implementation of the old Image modul?How do you simply rotate an inserted image (not copied from draw or impress!)?Please explain.

Thank you very much!Well, the summary says both1) Editing Hyperlink is too difficult; 2) add context menu entryAnd the description refers to a discussion that is no longer available:So what is the point?ad 1) Editing hyperlinks has been eased for OOo2.3 by making it possible toselect a hyperlink with a mouse click (rather than triggering the browser). Ifthe user then clicks the Hyperlink control in the toolbar she gets all optionsOOo offers to edit the hyperlink.ad 2) True, we still do not have a context menu entry to call the Hyperlink dialog.BTW there is also, with the request to remove hyperlinks with thehyperlink dialogMaybe we ask Utomo if he still recommends to implement a context menu item toopen the hypelink dialog. Is this the essence of the issue?Competitive AnalysisMSWord XP offers for non-hyperlink text the context menu items:1) Hyperlink... to open the Hyperlink dialogFor hyperlinks it offers the context menu items:1) Edit Hyperlink...2) Select Hyperlink3) Open Hyperlink4) Copy Hyperlink5) Remove HyperlinkIn my opinion 1 and 5 are essential.However, if we do something here we have to make sure that we do not interferewith the spellchecking context menu.IMO, assigning an RFE issue back to the submitter is not a good issue handling...Set target to OO later.So many time slipped by this issue was created.

id=24926	When typing information into a cell that starts the same as a cell above it, OOo will complete the information to match the previous cell. If the return key is pressed at that time, the cell will be auto-completed with that information, and the cursor will move on to the cell below it. An arrow button can be used in the same way as the return key, but the cursor will move in the direction of the arrow key pressed.When the tab key is pressed, if there is more than one possible match it will move to the next match rather than simply completing the cell and moving to the cell to the right. (If a cell contains the word dog, and the cell below it contains the work dragon, and the letter "d" is typed into the next cell down, the result will be d"og". If the tab key is then pressed, it will show d"ragon" instead of moving to the cell to the right.) I don't know if cycling through the possible auto-complete options is a feature or not, but I would much prefer to continue typing or simply copy the cell from one place to the other rather than use the tab key to cycle through if it means that I lose the use of the tab key for moving to the next cell.Long story short...The tab key should function the same way as the enter key except for the direction the cursor moves. This issue directly effects my productivity when using this product, and I would very much appreciate the change.Thank you Hi Bettina,if we do not use the TAB Key for cycling through the possibilities, what keyshould we use ?So I would sugest to close this as wontfix.FrankThe arrow keys seem like a much better option for cycling through the possibilities than using the tab key in a spreadsheet. When entering a large amount of data into a spreadsheet it is very cumbersome to have to move a hand from the "home row keys" just to be able to get to the next cell on the right. If I really want to get the next possibility for auto-complete, I'll continue typing a letter or two and it will come up. I have rarely if ever used any key to cycle through the different possibilities other than to continue typing as I just described. However, I am constantly using the tab key to get to the next cell. I would be willing to wager that most people used to Microsoft Excel would wholeheartedly agree with me, and since that's what most spreadsheets are made with you're going to need to provide functionality on par with what Microsoft has. People are willing to use Microsoft Office for more reasons than that they simply feel locked in. The functionality of the tab key in Microsoft Excel is far superior to what I have seen in OOo. I would very much like to see OOo match and even surpass Microsoft in all areas of office productivity. You may think that you have surpassed them in functionality with the way you have allowed people to cycle through auto complete possibilities. I might even agree with your point, but not when it compromises the functionality I have come to expect with the tab key. Have you really gotten that much positive response from using the tab key to cycle through different auto complete possibilities that you aren't even remotely willing to think of another possible key option? If you try to enter a matrix of data into an Excel spreadseet that is five columns across and ten rows deep by using the tab key across each row and using the enter key at the end of each row, you will see why I think that Microsoft has found a much better use of the tab key than you have. I truly hope that you consider my request seriously. I have heard others voice similar complaints. I am just trying to suggest a simple change that can have a big impact on user experience.I was searching through previous issues and I was able to find a few that weresimilar to this one though the initial motivation may have been different. Another possible solution would be to do the following:Add "Press Tab to move selection" to the list of"TOOLS-OPTIONS-SPREADSHEET-GENERAL-Iput Settings" with a drop down list justlike the one for "Enter". This setting would probably have to disable the tabscrolling for autocomplete.I don't want to disable the autocomplete feature. I just want it to play nicelywith the way I want to work.Are you simply ignoring this issue now?Hi BH, Your reminder. maybe you can consider for next version ? ThanksEveryone always talks about how one of the best things about open source is"choice." All I'm asking for is an option to change the behavior of the tab keysince what I (and many other Excel users) am used to and prefer isn't thedefault and isn't actually available. I'm not even asking you to change thedefault (even though some people would probably prefer it).Please consider making this enhancement. I don't know how to make the codingchanges or I would try and submit them.To grep the issues easier via "requirements" I put the issues currently lying onmy owner to the owner "requirements".

Once sample macros on how to do this were inOpenOffice.org, I was offering to help communicate to end users their existencevia user forums I assist on such asand. :-)I think vreid47362 worded it well when he said he wished there was "some genericcode and wizards to help end-users utilize this code" within OO.o somewhere.Side note: My emphasis on the word *right* was because I know some of the code Ihave borrowed from others to make my documents work were using non-standardcalls that were not formally the way to do it and the macros stopped workingwhen I upgraded OO.o.By far, the database application that I've used over the years that was easiestto create macros for was Lotus Approach, which was part of Lotus Smart Suite. This product had an extensive macro creation "guide/wizard" that make it verysimple for non-programmers to do basic automation tasks using macros.Since IBM/Lotus is implementing Lotus Symphony to replace Lotus Smart Suite,they may be interested in this issue also. In addition, I agree with safway. The macros or code generator or whatever theend product is needs to be based on good coding practices that use stable API's,not half-off hacks that may not work from version to version.Also, there are two extensions by Roberto Benitez:andthat provide some ofthe base macro creation and switchboard creation functionality that needs to beincluded. I believe that this code could be added to and made accessible in auser-friendly set of rapid application development wizards to get some of theneeded functionality into the Base product. This functionality could even bemaintained as an extension and installed like the Sun Report Builder.From previous communications I understand if licensing agreements allow, thatOO.o development team might take those very good addons and make them part ofthe core OO.o product.vreid47362's comment that "this functionality could even be maintained as anextension" might dovetail into those plans. I note, however, that their arealready extensions to do this. Therefore, it might be less work for thedevelopers if they simply work with the already-existing extensions????For me, the extension atalmost does itexcept for the "The extension can only be opened from a Registered Basedocument." requirement.Disclosure: I am in no way affiliated with the creator of any extension.To grep the issues easier via "requirements" I put the issues currently lying onmy owner to the owner "requirements".
id=27782	Hi,It would be nice if the Activex control could be enabled or disabled within the Tools -> Options area without resorting to performing a set up.For example, IIRC with Acrobat reader I can open the reader stand alone and enable/disable browser integration.Within the Internet Explorer when viewing a PDF file I can also disable the Acrobat reader.I don't think users expect to have to rerun install to switch this type of feature on and off.ThanksKelvin reassigned to bhStill present in 1.9.88.Confirming.Not sure if I understand why you would uninstall it if you chose to install it,but I think that this is one that is okay, because it is like installing acomponent or add-in. This is a feature that exists outside of OOo, so itwouldn't really be an internal option.I am marking as invalid, as I don't think this is an approriate or feasiblerequest. If you disagree, please reopen.Hi,I don't think you understand the request and most likely have not investigated how Acrobat Reader works in this area.With Acrobat Reader by default, when clicking on a PDF link in Internet Explorer, the PDF document is opened. It is often desirable to not open the PDF document, but to have the default be to be presented with the Save dialogue and have the PDF file saved to the hard disk for later reference.Acrobat Reader allows the user to select and change the default behaviour without uninstalling Acrobat Reader.With OpenOffice.org once the ActiveX option is installed clicking on a link to an OpenOffice.org document will open the document in the browser. This is fine. To change the default behaviour so the user is prompted to Save the document requires uninstalling the ActiveX option. This is very unfriendly. IMHO the user should not have to uninstall the option when they simply want to toggle the behaviour as Acrobat Reader allows. Would you tolerate having to uninstall and reinstall Acrobat Reader to change the default behaviour. I certainly wouldn't.I was simply suggesting the default behaviour for OpenOffice.org ActiveX control to be able to be turned on or off by the user via Tools -> Options.As uninstalling is the only way to currently do this, since reporting this issue I now don't install the ActiveX control. If I could toggle the feature on and off without installing/uninstalling, it would be a useful feature. At the moment it is not.Thanks for your time.KelvinTo grep the issues easier via "requirements" I put the issues currently lying onmy owner to the owner "requirements".
id=29152	Even though the webdav functionality as provided is very useful, having the ability to use webdav locking is really necessary - especially when sharing the editing permissions with other distributed authors. As an example webdav authoring with plone (plone.org) or the oocommunity sitewhere we would find the locking feature very useful. CPH Hi Kai,can you please have a look into this?Thanks,MatthiasSome general comments. This is not just about extending the WebDAV-UCP. Actually this task is a subtask for a bigger, new and more general Officefeature: support for collaborative work on documents. This must not berestricted to WebDAV, although it fits perfectly here. Implementing this newOffice feature is certainly much more work than extending the UCP.Any movement on this ? Maybe with some more description the community could help.Andreas, please take care.acceptedIn business context the collaborative ability is a natural extension to traditional standalone desktop office work (word processing and so on).Today the situation is as simple as following : to share documents, in an heteregoneous environment Linux/Mac/Windows with minimal locking there are 2 solutions :- using smb : it works well with Msoffice AND Openoffice, but it is not what I call a standard, despite the great work of samba team.For remote roaming users (out of the office) accessing a smb server trough various clients is a secure manner is not so simple as smb "needs" many ip ports to be opened.- using dav : supported by apache server, we can set up a common business set of "working group folders", each restricted to authorized user for viewing and modifying documents. This is standard, works gracefully with firewalls, easy to secure by tunneling http in SSH tunnel protected by use of ssh2 keys. Tunneling smb in ssh is possible but only with windows XP and not 9x/NT because XP supports virtual network cards.And I do not want too promote particularly XP in the company.Unfortunately today the support of dav locking is best in...Ms Office.Shortly there are 3 ways to use webdav in windows (2 in 9x/Me/NT and one more in 2k/XP) :...FOLLOW ON of my previous comments, since I typed "enter" too soon.....1/ by entering a "folder" url in internet explorer and open it as "Web Folder" : well funny but not so useful..2/ by creating a "permanent" network shortcut to a dav folder :then, with ms office versions from mso2000 to 2003 you can DOUBLE CLICK on any mso doc and it opens gracefully alerting about locking if another person has already opened the doc simply by dblclicking on it (no need to put a lock explicitely with a property sheet as is Novell NetDrive for example or the too simple "Dossiers Web libres".This works very well. and probably the most reliable solutions in Windows world...3/ refinement on 2k/XP : using -transparently- the Webclient service one can "MOUNT", I should say "MAP", a dav folder url to a local virtual drive (as we commonly do with SMB shares): interesting thing, giving the opportunity to DBL CLICK on ANY type of documents in remote locations (eg oo docs) BUT WITH ALMOST NO LOCKING SUPPORT: even for msoffice docs the webclient locking support between different versions of msoffice DOES NOT WORK (eg : no locking support between off2k and off2003, whereas with solutions 2/ it was ok...)I do not want of course to talk about the "sharepoint service" which is only a non standard MS "moneyware" MS wants to impose as a replacement for the "good" dav mechanism.Well finally it is a strategic business issue that :1/ oo supports oo interlocking access to a common dav folder.2/ AND, if possible, a shell extension in windows world and maybe in other platforms, allowing the DBL CLICK on a dav locations mounted locally as "network shortcut" (a MSwin particularity) and/or as a drive.3/ for "bad" interoperabilty reasons, be able to manage locking ON "MSoffice" docs CONCURRENTLY with other machines accessing the same docs not with oo but with MSOffice: ie transparent concurrency on msoffice docs WITH either other oo clients OR MS OFFICE clients.Hope this will help....FOLLOW ON of my previous comments, since I typed "enter" too soon.....1/ by entering a "folder" url in internet explorer and open it as "Web Folder" : well funny but not so useful..2/ by creating a "permanent" network shortcut to a dav folder :then, with ms office versions from mso2000 to 2003 you can DOUBLE CLICK on any mso doc and it opens gracefully alerting about locking if another person has already opened the doc simply by dblclicking on it (no need to put a lock explicitely with a property sheet as is Novell NetDrive for example or the too simple "Dossiers Web libres".This works very well. and probably the most reliable solutions in Windows world...3/ refinement on 2k/XP : using -transparently- the Webclient service one can "MOUNT", I should say "MAP", a dav folder url to a local virtual drive (as we commonly do with SMB shares): interesting thing, giving the opportunity to DBL CLICK on ANY type of documents in remote locations (eg oo docs) BUT WITH ALMOST NO LOCKING SUPPORT: even for msoffice docs the webclient locking support between different versions of msoffice DOES NOT WORK (eg : no locking support between off2k and off2003, whereas with solutions 2/ it was ok...)I do not want of course to talk about the "sharepoint service" which is only a non standard MS "moneyware" MS wants to impose as a replacement for the "good" dav mechanism.Well finally it is a strategic business issue that :1/ oo supports oo interlocking access to a common dav folder.2/ AND, if possible, a shell extension in windows world and maybe in other platforms, allowing the DBL CLICK on a dav locations mounted locally as "network shortcut" (a MSwin particularity) and/or as a drive.3/ for "bad" interoperabilty reasons, be able to manage locking ON "MSoffice" docs CONCURRENTLY with other machines accessing the same docs not with oo but with MSOffice: ie transparent concurrency on msoffice docs WITH either other oo clients OR MS OFFICE clients.Hope this will help.Anything new in this issue?ABI->KSO: As discussed ....Any news?KSO->TKR: Please take care of this issue..I've implemented the locking into the WebDAV UCP in ooo-build, you can see the patch here:So far it needs few more patches from ooo-build (gnome-vfs related) to work properly; I'll attach a bit cleaned up version soon for review.We can change the type to PATCH even now I think ;-).kendy: Thanks alot. As this patch is pretty large, may I kindly ask you toexplain at a conceptual level what this patch does. How is it exposed atapplication level? Some UI to check "lock it" upon opening a document or is itimplicit? ...After a very quick lock, some first notes from me:- don't use comphelper::getProcessFactory(). This is bad style. Keep, pass anduse always the process service factory that was used to create the UNO objectinstance. In theory, there can be more than one service factories in one OOo process- how is the XStream stuff related to webdav locking? Or is this another (IMOneat) feature? If so, please supply a separate patch to keep things more easyand straigthkso: Thank you for looking at this! Yes, I plan to separate the patch a bit so that it's easier to understand. But at least few answers now ;-)Generally, most of what the patch does is that it adds support for XActiveDataStreamer sinks, because that is the only way [I found ;-)] to be able to have the document open for all the time the user edits it - which is needed to be able to unlock the file after closing. The rest of the changes more or less depends on it - eg. the extension of the NeonInputStream to XStream (XActiveDataStreamer needs to get a full XStream).Another thing that needs comments is the "SupportsActiveStreaming" property. I've implemented it in another patch in ooo-build (,- I hope I did not forget other cases), because the code in sfx2 treats local files differently from others (even though everything should be provided by UCB), and for the XActiveDataStreamer to work in all the cases, this had to be extended.To answer your questions:Yes, the locking is implicit (similarly to the locking of files), if the document is locked on the server, it is opened read-only locally. The check for being locked needs a bit of an improvement, the response of the DAV server has to be checked if it is really 'document locked' error.comphelper::getProcessServiceFactory() is a crude hack, and I'm aware of that, but unfortunately it is impossible to avoid without even more growing the size of the patch :-( The reason is that ucbhelper::IsDocument() creates no interaction environment, but DAVAuthListener_Impl::authenticate() needs that to be able to provide the authentication dialog or information. When I added the creation of the interaction environment directly to ucbhelper::IsDocument(), I started getting error dialog boxes on OOo startup (harmless, but irritating). The other occurrence is in the stream destructor - again no idea how better to pass the service factory there :-( Already in the constructor? - ideas appreciated.XStream is needed for the XActiveDataStreamer as described above, the write when/if the NeonInputStream is dirty is still a TODO (but it seems not to be a problem for now).Please correct me if my assumptions above are wrong :-) Thank you!cc tbeset target 3.xSo - I'd like to create a CWS for this ;-) It will also contain a gnome-vfs locking work we did in the gvfs UCP. Please, could you help me getting it polished? I'm afraid there are going to be some controversial parts; in many cases, the there are hardcoded checks for 'file' protocols which I had to change to for 'SupportsActiveStreaming' property, etc.Things like the getProcessServiceFactory() could be hopefully cleaned up in a follow-up CWS (if really necessary). What do you think?kendy: Sounds good. Go ahead and let me know if you need any help.If we don't change the UI. We could set the target to OOo 3.0Committed to CWS webdavandgvfslocking1, now I'll try if it's warning-free etc. [it's a verbatim commit of the patches from ooo-build].Setting target to 3.0, the CWS contains no GUI changes. Please have a look - I'll be happy to answer any questions :-)kendy: Some comments after quickly reading the diff for CWS webdavandgvfslocking1.- Seems, that you put your fix for #i84137# "Remove gnome-vfs from startupprocedure" into this CWS (without adding the task to the CWS, btw.) As you knowI cannot accept this fix, because it violates UCB design constraint not to usesolar libs. OTOH, I cannot see how this changes are related to gnome-vfs filelocking. Please remove the changes for #i84137# from this CWS. Let's deal withthis problem another time.- remove comphelper::getProcessServiceFactory() calls. Use the servicefactory/component context that was used to create the UCP.- remove the hack to create your own Interaction Handler in case none isavailable (DAVResourceAccess::createCommandEnvironment()). The code calling theUCB must be changed to provide the right Interaction Handler, if one is needed.- remove the hard cast from XStream to NeonInputstrem you're doing inwebdavcontent.cxx in order to be able to call NeonInputStream::SetLock(). Thisis a hack, isn't it.- I don't really like that locking is only done in case an XActiveDataStreameris supplied with the "open" command. What about XOutputStream, XActiveDataSink"open"-variants?- Is the implementation of property "IsReadOnly" and "SupportactiveStreaming" isnot acceptable as it is now => Remove the "if ( rProperties.getLength() == 1 )"stuff. What is this good for?- "IsReadOnly" implementation seems to be a hack, too. Why is the value onlyavail in case m_bForceReadOnly is true? The property should always be available.The correct value should be obtained by inspecting the webdav-locking state ofthe resource.More comments to follow after I found the time to do a detailed analysis of yourchanges ;-)kso: I knew this was not going to be easy ;-) So:Sorry, this was a mistake during commit (forgot that our GnomeVFS section contains a bit more than just the locking patches), reverted in the CWS.I thought that the agreement in the above was to clean up this in a follow-up CWS. If you really want to have it cleaned up now, the patch will get even more complex and harder to integrate :-( But of course, I can do it.This opens another ugly can of worms :-( Of course I tried it first, but then even more parts of OOo had to be touched - eg. you get tons of dialogs like 'File blahbleh.xcu is not available' during startup if there was always an interaction handler available, etc.Removed on the expense of adding 2 more parameters to GET() - hopefully better now.I did not find a way do that, unfortunately :-( The stream in these case does not stay open, it is just read, and thrown away. You get no information when the document is closed, so you have no way to unlock the file again.Of course, the stream is locked while performing save (using the other UCB access methods), but that was there already before my changes, and it co-operates (uses the same lock store).not acceptable as it is nowOh - such stuff was in the WebDAV UCP itself ages before when the gnome-vfs locking was introduced (see eg. checking for 'Title' property in OOG680_m*), and I just mimicked that at that time (and I did not update it after it vanished).Fixed in the CWS now.Well - I need to return 'true' there when we are locked - so that the UI can react accordingly, and has nothing to do with the fact if the resource is really read-only on the remote end, or not. If we had better way to present the user that it is locked, I would use that one ;-)The fact that 'IsReadOnly' property is not implemented (got from the remote end) is not really my problem here ;-) - but of course can be addressed in a follow-up CWS if necessary.Oh - please don't make it too bad, or I'll run away screaming ;-) BTW, why are there the abstract classes (DAV*.hxx)? Do you have a different implementation (not using neon) in StarOffice? Or is it just remnant of some other implementation, and would deserve cleanup as well?Thank you a lot for your feedback!kendy:>Okay. Thanks.>I suggest to change it in this CWS. I'm afraid, it would stay that bad forever,otherwise. ;-)>We have to find a solution for this problem in this CWS. You have to find theplaces where to supply an IH and where not. Always supplying an IH is obviouslynot working.>Thanks. Sure.>I thought about this some time ago. IMO, we need a "close" command for the UCBthat is executed by the application framework whenever a document gets closed.>Cool.>The property IsReadOnly has a predefined semantics. If you need somethingsimilar, but nt exactly the same semantics, you have to introduce a differentproperty name. How about "IsLocked"? BTW, you should talk to tbe (on CC here) about a better way to present the userthat a document is locked. IIRC, he's working on something like this right now.Would be great if we could join efforts here.IIRC, it's actually your problem, because you introduced support for thisproperty, but sort of "incomplete". But I'd go for the "IsLocked" propertyapproach...>Please don't get me wrong. Your work is highl appreciated. as you said, yourpatch is kind of incomplete and needs some polishing.No, we don't have a different implementation for StarOffice. The abstractclasses are actually of no use. Feel free to remove them, if you like.Even if I promise? ;-) Well - I'll have a look.Well, I don't know how to solve it then :-( What I had was the following IIRC:#--- comphelper/source/misc/mediadescriptor.cxx#+++ comphelper/source/misc/mediadescriptor.cxx#@@ -754,9 +754,12 @@ sal_Bool MediaDescriptor::impl_openStreamWithURL(const ::rtl::OUString& sURL)# throw(::com::sun::star::uno::RuntimeException)# {# // prepare the environment#+ css::uno::Reference< css::lang::XMultiServiceFactory > xFactory( ::comphelper::getProcessServiceFactory(), uno::UNO_QUERY );# css::uno::Reference< css::task::XInteractionHandler > xOrgInteraction = getUnpackedValueOrDefault(# MediaDescriptor::PROP_INTERACTIONHANDLER(),#- css::uno::Reference< css::task::XInteractionHandler >());#+ css::uno::Reference< css::task::XInteractionHandler > (#+ xFactory->createInstance( rtl::OUString( RTL_CONSTASCII_USTRINGPARAM("com.sun.star.uui.InteractionHandler") ) ), css::uno::UNO_QUERY )#+ );# # StillReadWriteInteraction* pInteraction = new StillReadWriteInteraction(xOrgInteraction);# css::uno::Reference< css::task::XInteractionHandler > xInteraction(static_cast< css::task::XInteractionHandler* >(pInteraction), css::uno::UNO_QUERY);dIdeas appreciated - the authentication dialog is needed there - think of a user that does not want OOo to remember the password - then he needs to be presented with the dialog every time (and that's not possible without the IH from what I saw, but maybe I did not see everything?).OK - but let's agree that this is not going to be part of this CWS - is that OK for you? 'file' UCP does not have this either.Well - this way I would need to touch even the 'file' UCP to provide the 'IsLocked' property as well instead of returning 'IsReadOnly', and other parts of OOo to make this right; searching for all the occurrences, extend it to handle it correctly, ...Sorry, I refuse to do it in this CWS ;-) - I hope you understand.tbe: Or maybe you already have a solution for the above already ('IsLocked' or something)?Well, I'll have a look if neon can return it somehow.OK, I'll do it in the follow-up CWS.kendy: what's the problem with the InteractionHandler here? Why do you thinkthat you need one? Sorry in case that question looks dumb, but I couldn't findany reference in the previous comments why this might be necessary.Is it because you want to show a dialog even if no Interaction handler isprovided? This is bad because it will break all applications that want to runwithout user interaction. In this case it would be much better to proceedsilently with an unlocked and read-only document. We do the same for documentsin the file system we can't lock.IIRC the way we are doing this is to catch the exception that tells about thelock failure) and restart the "open" command, now without different parameters.cc mavkendy:Without knowing any details, I think that a 'IsLocked' property isthe right approach. In CWS calcshare2, which will be integratedhopefully soon, Mikhail Voitenko (MAV) improved file lockingfor documents on local file systems. Part of this feature is, thatan additional lock file is written. MAV also made some changes tothe user interaction. If a document is locked, an interaction handleropens a dialog, which allows the user to open the documentin readonly mode or create a copy of the document.I'm sure, MAV can give some more details here.I will set him on cc.The new locking mechanics in calcshare2 cws is just a workaround forheterogeneous network file systems problem. Unfortunately, in some cases thesystem file locking does not work there as expected. The necessary for theworkaround lock file is used to store the information about the user, thisinformation can be used in the new com.sun.star.document.LockedDocumentRequestrequest later.The current usage of "IsReadOnly" property is no hack from my point of view, ifwe agree that ReadOnly mode of documents is not hack, that is actuallyquestionable for me. Although I can not say anything abouth implemenation. Infew words the approach in MediaDescriptor is as follows:- the file URLs can be opened for editing and locked, so if it is not possibleto do it the file is locked or readonly or does not exist and can not be created...- all other URLs do not allow file locking, so the file is always openedReadOnly; if the "IsReadOnly" property not set it will be allowed to edit thedocumentSo the new WebDAV locking could do something like following to let it work atleast as the file locking before without introducing of the new property for allthe contents ( and as I understood this is the wish for the first step ) :- the file URL is handled as before- the WebDAV content should provide information whether it is possible to getreadwrite stream from the content in general ( in other words the fact that theserver supports the feature, sorry I do not know whether it always so ), if yesthe impossibility to open the stream means exactly the same as in case of file-URL- all other cases ( including WebDAV that supports no locking ) are handled asbefore based on IsReadOnly property and input streamBy the way, generally the change in calcshare2 should not affect the WebDAVlocking mechanics, although after the cws calcshare2 is integrated the SfxMediumpart should be adjusted to let new WebDAV locking be used. It is a quite smallchange, but it is already too late to integrate it in calcshare2 since QA roundis already in progress.Sorry in the block"The current usage of "IsReadOnly" property is no hack from my point of view, ifwe agree that ReadOnly mode of documents is not hack, that is actuallyquestionable for me. Although I can not say anything abouth implemenation."please read"The current usage of "IsReadOnly" property is no hack from my point of view, ifwe agree that ReadOnly mode of documents is not hack, that is actuallyquestionable for me. Although I can not say anything abouth implemenation of the"IsReadOnly" property in UCB."mba: The code in question is this:int DAVAuthListener_Impl::authenticate( const ::rtl::OUString & inRealm, const ::rtl::OUString & inHostName, ::rtl::OUString & inoutUserName, ::rtl::OUString & outPassWord ){ uno::Reference< task::XInteractionHandler > xIH; if ( m_xEnv.is() ) xIH = m_xEnv->getInteractionHandler(); else xIH = DAVResourceAccess::createCommandEnvironment()->getInteractionHandler();The 'else' part is the hack we are talking about... I'd really love to get rid of that, but without that part, the authentication just fails exactly in the cases when there is no interaction handler ( xIH.is() returns false).In the old code, there is a hack that caches old password; but this works only if the _first_ call is done with existing interaction handler, and the consequent ones use this cached password. But this is not the case after the changes, with XActiveDataStreamer, the calls _without_ the interaction handler are the first ones.And this is regardless of the locking - it is just the way it is accessed, IIRC it is propagated from some exist() method of something - can find the details on request.But maybe I'm really doing something wrong myself ;-) - ideas still appreciated.mav: For me, it would be perfectly OK to create a follow-up CWS for WebDAV locking after 'calcshare2' is integrated to change it so that it does it the same way as 'file' UCB (presenting the dialog saying 'this is locked' if the interaction handler is available, etc.)Please - would that be OK for you? (Until calcshare2 is not in, show it as read-only if locked; when calcshare2 is integrated, do the changes in the WebDAV UCB?)kendy: I hope that we have the common understanding that creating an IH insidethe UCB is simply plain wrong. It is a must for every client of the UCB tosupply the right IH. This can be the VCL-based IH usually used in OOo, but itcan also be a completeöy different implementaion. For instance the UCB isheavily used by the command line tool unopkg. unopkg must not instanciate theVCL-based IH, but this is what you're currently doing.As MBA has already mentioned, only the InteractionHandler from MediaDescriptorshould be used during document opening. If there is no InteractionHandler, nointeraction is allowed, in this case the authentication has no other choice thanto fail and throw an exception.The scenario when MediaDescriptor has an InteractionHandler is more complex.If an InteractionHandler is provided to UCB, it will be used not only for queryand authentication interactions, but also for error handling. Although most ofUCB errors ( "no file", "can not open readwrite" and etc. ) are no errors incontext of document loading, so they must not be shown.The only solution, that I see in this case, is to use a wrapper overInteractionHandler from MediaDescriptor, that handles only a subset ofinteractions, and to provide this wrapper to UCB in all the cases when UCB isused to load a document.But that would require checking of the UCB implementation, since theimplementation has to check whether at least one continuation has been selected,otherwise the related exception must be thrown by UCB. I am not sure that UCBdoes it already.By the way, does it really makes sense not to remember the password at least forruntime. The problem is that in this case there might be a huge amount ofauthentication dialogs, that makes the scenario quite unuseful. Is it really acase that has to be handled?kso: Well, I guess it really is wrong, but I really don't know how to solve the problem described above without that - I learn just by what I see in the other parts of OOo, and in the debugger. And I saw creating the InteractionHandler in ucbhelper (), so I thought what was good enough for ucbhelper, must be good enough for ucb's ucp as well, or not?I'd really want to get rid of it - please tell me the way, and I'll do it [or feel free to change it in the CWS yourself - that would be even more appreciated!]BTW, I don't rely on the VCL implementation, I rely on whatever uno::Reference< task::XInteractionHandler > ( xFactory->createInstance( rtl::OUString( RTL_CONSTASCII_USTRINGPARAM("com.sun.star.uui.InteractionHandler") ) ), uno::UNO_QUERY ); returns me, which to me looks OK from the UNO point of view [which still might be wrong from the UCB point of view, of course ;-)]kendy: using a customized IH, like mav suggested, sounds really very good to me.mav: The special IH we're using while loading documents, isn't this exactly whatkendy is looking for? Where is this IH implemented? Can he not just use it aswell? There would be no need to implement another specialized IH, then.mav: Thank you for your answer, this is what I needed.Please, do you think you could help me with it? Like a proto-patch, or even directly in the CWS? Or at least some code pointers [like it's something similar to what we do in blah/bleh/ugh.cxx:234-450, method GG::HH()]?Thank you a lot in advance!I see no problem if implementation is adjusted after calcshare2 is ready. But Iwould like to repeat, after integration of calcshare2 the WebDAV file locking ofdocuments will not work at all. Although it can be easily fixed with a small change.There is a number of similar wrappers implemented in office including thementioned one, but I do not know any that would do exactly what expected in thiscase - allow only authentication requests. From other side it should be easy toimplement one, docfile.cxx has similar implementation that is not used any more,so it could be adjusted to do exactly this.kendy: I can implement the wrapper and use it in sfx2 and comphelper tomorrow.Please add comphelper project to cws in this case.mav: Thank you a lot! Added the 'comphelper' module to the CWS. Also I now noticed CommandEnvironment_Impl directly in webdavcontent.cxx, maybe it would be better to re-use this one? It seems to be exactly what is needed - implementing handling the passwords only.kso, mav: Do you think it would be enough to move this one to the comphelper?kendy: I assume that Kai's reservation against using uui is that this willcreate a runtime dependency against VCL as this component links against it. AndUCB is a component that should be usable in "VCL-free" environments.But anyway, I think we are moving towards a good solution.mba: OTOH - UNO handles it correctly, and in VCL-free environments, the query just returns a null IH, and all bad that happens is that even with the hack the webdav UCP does not authenticate (the code is ready to handle xIH.is() == false). But yeah, I think it will be better without this.And yes, I'm very pleased with the direction of all this [not just the interaction handler part], and really thank all the involved people for helping and extremely fast responses!kendy, mav: I still cannot understand why we cannot use the already existingspecialized IH here that was designed exactly to handle all interactions thatare of interest when loading documents. Have we actually tried this? If yes,what went "wrong" with it? Are we sure that we're only interested inauthentication requests when loading docs "the new way"? Or do we just not knowthat we're actually interested in all the other interactions that are handled bythe doc-loader IH?kso: You mean the CommandEnvironment_Impl in webdavcontent.cxx? I did not use it, because I overlooked it (as I said in the). That's why I asked in that comment what to do with this - if the correct use is just to use this one in the 'else' part of the piece code from, perfect for me!kendy: No, I'm talking about the IH implementation mav mentioned before. Theone, that resides in sfx2. I still think that it is worth a try to just use itinstaed of implementing something new in comphelper. I don't think that using CommandEnvironment_Impl is a good idea. This class hasbeen introduced as a workaround for a bug only (parts of the code are copiedverbatim from UUI Interaction Handler implementation, for instance) and I'dreally like to get rid of this rather using it at other places. From my point ofview the wrapper-approach mav suggested is the best option we have to solve theproblem. mav: Where can we find the implementation of the before mentioneddocument-loader IH?kso: There are three interaction handlers that are used during the loadingimplemented in framework/source/interaction. Not all of them are wrappers, andthey are definitely not related to the scenario.So I thought that you were meaning the interaction handler implemented insfx/source/doc/docfile.cxx ( that is not used any more ) and the implementationin comphelper/source/misc/mediadescriptor.cxx ( that replaces the previous one). Both of them prevent showing of "access denied", "locking violation" and"unsupported data sink" error. All other errors would be handled. I just was notsure that this is enough.It is definitely enough when the InteractionHandler wrapper is used inMediaDescriptor implementation only, since in this case the error will be showonly once while retrieving the stream. The problem is that in case this handleris used in SfxMedium and probably some other places in sfx2 the same error mightbe shown more than once because the current implementation in sfx2 does notexpect interation in most places where UCB is called.From other side the probability of such an error is small enough to use theInteractionHandler wrapper without change for now and adjust it later.While thinking a little bit more about this I have recognized that it is indeednot necessary to adjust the InteractionHandler wrapper in themediadescriptor.cxx to avoid duplicate errors. There is already another wrapperin framework that does exactly this, and if I am not wrong it is used alreadyduring the loading. Sorry, I needed some time to recognize this. :)So as kso has mentioned we can just export the wrapper from mediadescriptor.cxxand use it in sfx2. Or even use the old implementation from the docfile.cxx asfirst step since it does pretty the same.I have just commited the changes to the cws. I have compiled them but did nottest in office since I do not have access to the cws build.The following files has been changed:comphelper/inc/comphelper/stillreadwriteinteraction.hxxcomphelper/source/misc/mediadescriptor.hxxsfx/source/doc/docfile.cxxIn addition, please test opening of documents from a WebDAV server that requiresauthentication but does not support locking.mav: Thank you a lot! Works great now without the 'the hack to create your own Interaction Handler' from(committed the removal already) both for the normal server, as well as with the one not supporting locking.So far it seems that the getProcessServiceFactory() removal is the last thing (right?), working on that now.kendy, mav: Thanks guys for sorting the Interaction Handler stuff out.kendy: Yes, next thing to to is to get rid of the getProcessServiceFactory() stuff.Additionally, I will check whether your new code for the "open" command stillfits to the fix for a "open" command multihtreading issue I just did in a recentCWS. If changes are needed, I will do them directly on your CWS.So, what are the things we agreed to target in followup CWS(s)?(1) Fix webdav file locking after integration of CWS calcshare2(2) In case of file is locked, make DAV-UCP and GVFS-UCP behave like File-UCPafter CWS calcshare2 is integrated (use new "file is locked" interaction, ...).(3) Fix implementation of property "IsReadOnly" to respect server-side read-onlycase (=> DAV property "lockdiscovery", describes the active locks on a resource)(4) Support locking not only if XActiveDataStreamer is used, but also forXOutputStream and XActiveDataSink (implement "close" command for all UCPssupporting locking?)Anything else?@kendy: I am wondering whether any of the changes to module tools, especiallythe controversial changes in tools/inc/tools/urlobj.hxx:1.2.118.2 andtools/source/fsys/urlobj.cxx:1.61.26.2 (see<>) are necessaryfor webdav (resp. gvfs) locking.sb: The introduction of INET_PROT_GENERIC_HIERARCHICAL is from 79843, so it's not completely locking-related; added (cwsaddtask) the issue to the CWS. [Sorry, the same thing as what happened with #i84137# () :-(].As to the username & password, it is convenient in the WebDAV case to be able to provide the possibility, and the code in the WebDAV UCP had code for that (though a bit broken). I agree that it is not good user behavior, but OTOH the users want it (), and other applications (in KDE and Gnome) support this as well, so... But if you insist it should not be there, I can make it ooo-build only [though I'd rather up-stream it].kso: getProcessServiceFactory() calls are gone, and it still seems to work ;-) As to the points you wrote, I'd like to:(5) Remove the abstract classes.kendy: I checked for the potential multithreading issue I mentioned earlier.Looks good. No changes were needed.Cool.Thanks. I forgot that we already agreed to change this. If I only had an idea how to remove the ugly hacks from NeonInputStream.cxx Ijust stumbled over... I will come back to you on this.@kendy:Re INET_PROT_GENERIC_HIERARCHICAL: The code did look like deja vu, but I hadcompletely lost track of. Thanks for clarifying.Re username & password: Nah, having it only downstream in ooo-build is probablynot what anybody wants. I do not *insist*, so if you *do* insist---go ahead. ;)sb: I kind of do ;-) - so I've let it there.kso: As we discussed by mail, let's try to make the CWS ready is it is now, regardless the hack in NeonInputStream.cxx.I've resynced it to DEV300-m16, builds beautifully, but unfortunately, the interaction handler solution still seems not to be perfect :-(mav: Please, do you think you could have a look? During startup (./soffice -calc), I get error dialogs like 'Error loading BASIC of document file <the-installation>/share/uno_packages/cache/uno_packages/3OLqkL_/pdfimport.oxt/script.xlb: General Error. General input/output error.' [repeats several times, for each extension] At the moment, I'm double checking that I don't get it without the CWS, and I'll try to have a look myself as well - but... ;-)mav: OK, the error dialog box looks unrelated, I get it even without the CWS ;-) - so I'll do a bit more testing tomorrow and pass the CWS to QA.The error message is a result of an installed extension that was not properlydeinstalled (but perhaps removed in the file system). You can fix it by eitherremoving the whole user profile or just the uno_packages folder - or by pokinginside of some files that might take more time.Unfortunately, now I found a real problem - the save does not work, again thanks to non-existing interaction handler :-(mav: Please, could you re-test in your environment that I'm not seeing ghosts here? ;-) Could you please help me solving this? I got into a dead-end a bit after trying to patch left and right - see the attached proto-patch please, but it is still not working :-( - apparently either more places has to be touched, or I'm patching them a wrong way... Thank you a lot in advance!CreatedThe patch.I see the problem. The InteractionHandler is still not transported to UCB always.The last patch part regarding docfile.cxx looks good, although I am not surethat SfxMedium::GetInteractionHandler() will be accepted by all the compilers asconst, since it changes the member of the pImp pointer.The last patch part regarding fileaccess.cxx and ucbhelper.cxx does not helpsince the xInteractionHandler reference wrapped with::comphelper::StillReadWriteInteraction is empty, and thus can not show anydialog. But even if is would be initialized with the default InteractionHandler,it would be even worse hack than it was before. Before the interaction handlerwas explicitly created only for webdav protocol, and now it would be created forall the protocols. So from my point of view it is no acceptable solution.The ucbhelper.cxx could be fixed easily by providing the InteractionHandler tothe help functions as an argument. The problem with fileaccess.cxx is moredifficult, the service implemented there does not allow to provide theInteractionHandler at all so it should be reimplemented. As well as theimplementations that use the service. I am not sure that it is possible to reachthis for OOo3.0.To reach the OOo3.0 deadline I would suggest to use SfxMedium as a buffer as itwas actually done before ( implicit ) for webdav protocol, since the protocoldid not allow to write directly. It is a pretty small change, inSfxMedium::GetOutputStorage() the call GetTempFileNoCopy() should not be calledonly for local files for now ( IsLocalFile() check instead ofSupportsActiveStreaming ). If this workaround will be used, please write me anew bug to fix SfxMedium for the direct saving for the webdav account in future.mav: Thanks for the help! Now fixed in the CWS, I'll attach here the patch I used [both the SfxMedium::SupportsActiveStreaming() and SfxMedium::GetOutputStorage() hunks are needed to make it working]. I also used const_cast<>() instead of the making GetInteractionHandler() const, hopefully this will be acceptable by all the compilers :-)Changing the issue to FIXED - should be OK now. Thanks everyone for the help!CreatedThe patch.Reassigning to Tobias for verification.up-stream version has too old gnome-vfs, and so the gnome-vfs part cannot be compiled. As discussed with Tobias, it was removed from the CWS, and now is tracked as.mav: I've been testing the stuff a bit more now (due to resync to m21), and found more problems :-( The scenario that is failing now: Open the WebDAV document, save it (works OK), and save it for the second time. Now, pInStreamItem->GetValue() >>= pImp->xInputStream; (line 2248, in SfxMedium::GetMedium_Impl()) fails, and results in error dialog box saying "The object cannot be accessed due to insufficient user rights.".

I'm still a bit confused by the SfxMedium stuff :-(There were actually two problems. The first one, the main reason is that thebackup creation has got no InteractionHandler, so it has failed. The normalbackup creation copies the file to the backup folder, and only if it is notpossible it tries to make backup in the destination folder ( for the case ofprotected folders ). But that should happen only for file-systems, so the secondproblem was that the target folder was tried for backup creation in case ofwebdav protocol as well.The fix for both problems follows soon.mav->kendy: Sending the bug to you for now. Please send it back if the providedfix does not help.Createdmav->kendy: A schematic patch. Sorry, did not compile it, preparing of the cws environment would take too long.mav: Unfortunately, did not help :-( I'm now trying to catch all the places that call authenticate() without an existing interaction handler, and there's still quite a bunch of them - I wonder if the decision I must not create an IH in the webdav ucp was really right :-(Anyway - when I have all, I'll update you with info if it helped, and with a patch for review.mav->kendy: Does the patch solve the problem the stack points to?mav: It did not help, so still clueless :-( If you can get this CWS environment at some stage & try, that would be most appreciated. Thank you a lot for your help!mav: Tracked again the 1st case, and it is the same even with the changes - pInStreamItem->GetValue() >>= pImp->xInputStream; (line 2248, in SfxMedium::GetMedium_Impl()) still fails.mav->kendy: I am in progress with building the cws locally.set target to OOO 3.1 because code freeze for 3.0 is today.any news?After the task has got the new target, I have postponed the investigations. Butthe issue has highest priority in my 3.1 list currently. So I plan to start nextweek with investigations.I have just commited the change for the cws. The scenario with the second savinglooks to work well now.mav: Great, thank you a lot! Let me resync the CWS to the most current milestone (probably m29), test it a bit, and set Ready for QA :-)mav: So I got to this again; I've resynced to m29, and again I'm getting "Error saving the document XY: Error creating object. Could not create backup copy." when I try to save:-(( Unfortunately I did not try before the resync to see if it was there even before, or if it's something new. Could you please have a look again?Reopening according to the above comment.I am building the cws currently and will investigate the problem as soon aspossible.mav->kandy: The reported by you problem ( open a document, save it, save itsecond time => error ) that I have fixed before the resync is not reproducibleby me after the resync.The only problematic scenario I found currently is when a new document is storedto webdav. This problem should be fixed in mav37 cws ( should be integrated inthe next milestone of DEV300 branch ). If you know any other problematicscenarios please explain them in details.I think it makes sense to resync the cws one more time after integration ofmav37, since the changes from mav37 affect the storing process.mav: Thank you! I'll resync & retry when it's integrated - hopefully all will be OK then :-)mav->kendy: I have integrated the changes from mav37 into this cws and it lookslike they are not enough, although necessary. The additional problem is thatwebdav ucp returns true as property value of "IsDocument" property if thedocument does not exist.As I understand the ucp must return false in this case ( or throw an exception,the idl specification seems not to cover this case explicitly ). Please correctme if I am wrong with my understanding.just a small correction to my last comment: I have integrated the changeslocally, I did not commit anything.CreatedCould you please try with this patch?mav: For non-dav resources, it implicitly returned IsDocument == true; the patch refrains from that when we got 404 (not found) - hopefully it does not break something else ;-)mav->kendy: Yes, the patch solves the problem.Do we have a deadlock here?Is somebody waiting for somebody else?And what about- does it still have any relevance?mba: No deadlock ;-) I resynced the CWS to m37, but unfortunately failed to make it perfect for the feature freeze :-( - I'll resync it to m40 now, and hopefully it'll get to 3.2...mba: As to the, no idea - gnome-vfs got obsoleted by gio in the meantime, so I guess the gnome-vfs with the locking features will never get to the up-steam builds.Ah, great! Please let me know if something gets stuck.wrt.: we are currently discussing inwhether gvfs isstill needed; we will definitely keep it for Solaris (but I would understand ifthat's not enough for your to justify the upstreaming of the gvfs locking ;-)),I'm not sure how many combinations of older Linux versions and OOo3.x we have tosupport where gio can't be used.move target to 3.2Seems likeis affected by these patches. Please review.I'm using OpenOffice from Ubuntu Jaunty, which incorporates these patches.I'm attempting to edit files in Atlassian Confluence via DAV, but Confluencerequires a file to be LOCKed before the file can be updated with a PUT request. This code, however, appears to unlock the file just before writing, then lockit again just after writing.Is there a reason for this behavior? Can it be adjusted to leave the fileLOCKed while performing the PUT?These are the requests seen from OO when editing a file via DAV on an Apache 2.2server:<Ask OO to open the file>"PROPFIND /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 207 543 "-" "-""LOCK /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 200 402 "-" "-""GET /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 200 11264 "-" "-""PROPFIND /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 207 482 "-" "-"<Make some changes and ask OO to save the file>"UNLOCK /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 204 - "-" "-""PROPFIND /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 207 543 "-" "-""PROPFIND /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 207 500 "-" "-""PROPFIND /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 207 482 "-" "-""PROPFIND /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 207 1177 "-" "-""GET /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 200 11264 "-" "-""PUT /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 204 - "-" "-""PROPFIND /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 207 482 "-" "-""PROPFIND /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 207 543 "-" "-""LOCK /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 200 402 "-" "-""GET /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 200 10240 "-" "-"<Close the file>"UNLOCK /test/test.doc HTTP/1.1" 204 - "-" "-"Note that the file is UNLOCKed before doing the PUT, then LOCKed again afterward.As these patches you mention have not been included the upstream OpenOffice.org,this is the wrong place to report problems in them. File a bug in the Ubuntu bugtracker. (From which then the maintainer will forward it to bugzilla.novell.comwhere the ooo-build bugs are.)P.S. It's counter-productive to use weird terms like "Atlassian Confluence"expecting readers to know what that is if it matters to the case (which itprobably doesn't?). You could at least explain shortly, or just use some genericterm "a website" or whatever.what's the status with the patch and integration ?A disaster.***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***BTW, we have noticed that in ooo-build, where we use a current reincarnation ofkendy's patch, when one pastes into Writer the HTML contents of a web page, OOowants to read images in that HTML page through the webdav UCP (and even tries tolock them then, i.e. lots of in this case IMHO pointless hideous complexity getsinvolved). Is the use of the webdav UCP in a case like this as expected and doesit happen also in upstream OOo?Should the images be read in as read-only? Or is the expectation that if one isediting a document in Writer that has originated as a web page, then the imagesincluded in that documented are editable and saveable back to the location fromwhich they are opened even?Please note that I am just asking for some friendly hints from upstream expertshere, I am not expecting you to solve problems caused by our code patches for us.There is no special webdav UCP, we have the same UCP for webdav and http. As theformer is just an extension to the latter we thought that this should be fine(and I still believe that this is true). I didn't study the patch, but if this patch has the consequence that the UCPitself decides on whether locking should be applied or not, this might explainthe observed behavior. Opening the files "read only" would be fine if thatsolved the problem, though I think that we should be able to open files inread/write mode without locking also (at least that is possible in the filesystem). Whether locking is applied or not should be a decision of the code thatuses the UCP to open files.BTW: can you explain what your comment "a disaster" means? Is there anything Ican do to make the situation "less disastrous"? ;-)tml: Could you please attach the "current reincarnation of kendy's patch" tothis issue. I would be happy to take a look at it.Yes, but it is in a source directory called "webdav" and many of its sourcefiles have a "webdav" prefix, so I tend to call it "the webdav UCP" ;)That probably is what is going on. I *think* that when I worked on making thepatch "work" in the 3.0 timeframe, I wasn't even fully aware that it indeed isused also for plain http , which was of course a bit of failure from my side.It means that the more time I spend staring in my editor or the debugger at thecode touched and added by the patch, the less I understand it, and the moreconvinced I am that it "works" by accident;)Sure, it's no secret, in a public git repo and all, so I'll attach it below.CreatedThe current "webdav-locking.diff" in ooo-build, applies to ooo320-m2 for instanceUCB clients, when executing the command "open", can supply information whetherlocking of a resource is requested. Refer to the api reforucb/source/ucp/file/bc.cxx (-> look for SHARE_DENY) to get the idea. WebDAV-UCPcurrently does not support these open command options. IMO, implementing thismissing functionality and replacing all the implicit locking stuff with correctopen command usage in framework/sfx2 is the right starting point. Everythingelse is just hacks. ;-)OpenMode DOCUMENT_SHARE_DENY_WRITE should be mapped to a DAV write lock, I guess.tml wrote:I fully agree here. -) After spending some time with studying the patch (andthe changes done afterwardsin CWS webdavandgvfslocking1) I got the idea, but Istill have concerns re both the concept and the implementation:a) The WebDAV-UCP simply cannot safely decide on its own whether it is okay tolock the DAV resource before doing the GET. It might be okay in the context ofloading a document, but not in case of loading linked graphics (like tmldescribed above) or when doing an extension/product update ping. Well, with thepatch a client might control this using the type of data sink handed over to the"open" command (it must be a data streamer in order to trigger locking, IIRC),but I consider this not optimal, despite of the current framework bugs not usingthe different data sinks "right". b) The patch is rather big, even after taking out the code peaces that are notrelated to WebDAV locking. Larger code changes in sensitive areas, spread overmany modules ... c) ooo-build uses this patch for a longer time now and still has issues withthis feature (see above)d) The CWS is based on an ancient OOo milestone. Resyncing will be like hell,I'm afraid.e) If I got things right, the implementation of determining whether a resourceis locked and therefore shall be openened readonly is currently based of amember variable of the corresponding UCB content object. This breaks as soon asthe corresponding object gets released while the document is open, which doescurrently not happens -- by luck.f) The current implementation contains many room for improvements (likediscussed and confirmed earlier in this issue), including hacks for that wedon't have a clue how to do things right. Thus, I sat together with mav (he is known to be our document load/saveframework expert) and discussed the locking-topic in depth. The outcome is thatwe would prefer an implicit locking approach. Every UCB content implementation(not just WebDAV) could support two new commands "lock" and "unlock". "lock"creates an exclusive write lock with an indefinite lifetime. Client must call"unlock" to release the lock when it is done with the document (document getsclosed). This approach has several advantages over the current (the implicitlocking) approach:a) The OOo document load/save framework is the right place to decide whether alock is needed for the document resource. All needed context is available there.b) Meanwhile (since the patch was created) the framework was greatly enhanced ina way that it is now easy to add the lock/unlock logic.c) Far less (non-UCB) code changes in less places are necessary to implementgeneric document locking feature for OOo. d) The new concept does not only work for WebDAV. Even the file-UCP could beextended to support the new lock/unlock commands instead of the "open" commandwith special arguments approach it currently supports.e) a clean implementation, without hacks should be possible (can tell this forsure for WebDAV-UCP ;-) Having all this said, I want to give you a heads up that I createdto extend the WebDAV-UCP to support the new lock / unlock commands.Implementation makes good progress. I took as many code peaces (as well asconceptional ideas) from the original locking patch. This saved me some time. Ivery appreciate the work already done by the original patch contributors. Thanksa lot. Plan is to implement the necessary OOo document load/save framework changesasap. This part will be done by mav. If all works out well, we will end up with OOo 3.3 supporting WebDAV locking ina clean and maintainable way. :-)I meant of course "explicit locking approach". ;-)Indeed. I spent an evening trying but didn't get very far...kso: I like your approach :-) In addition to the abovementioned, far too many places in OOo used to special-case the case when files were written, I believe this will help to clean up that too. Thank you![Just a note about the indefinite lifetime, in the WebDAV case it should be implemented as a lock that tries to renew itself before the expiration - for the cases when the connection is lost, etc. Otherwise it might get locked on the server forever without any possibility to unlock it from the client side.]Thanks. :-)Right. My implementation of the "lock" comamnd always requests 180-sec timeoutlocks and I use a thread that triggers a lock refresh 30 secs before the lockexpires. Works out pretty good, except for IIS and WSS, which behave "weird"wrt. DAV locking. Still working on that.The corresponding CWS 'webdavandgvfslocking1 is on target OOo 3.4. Therefore Ichange the target of this issue accordingly.I think this issue should now be resolved as a duplicate of i#106830, whichseems to use at least partially code/inspiration from the patch here anyway.*** This issue has been marked as a duplicate of 106830 ***No, not a duplicate of, but depending on. Reopen.Added a new one, see, where it takes into account the serf library added to AOOA WebDAV compliant server is not required to support locking in any form. If the server does support locking it may choose to support any combination of exclusive and shared locks for any access types.DAV:lockdiscovery propertyThe DAV:lockdiscovery property returns a listing of who has a lock, what type of lock he has, the timeout type, the time remaining on the timeout, the associated lock token and the root of the lock. <!ELEMENT lockdiscovery (activelock)* > <!ELEMENT activelock (lockscope, locktype, depth, owner?, timeout?, locktoken?, lockroot) >Depth: the value of the Depth header <!ELEMENT depth (#PCDATA) >owner: provides information about the principal taking out a lock (see Section 2.5.5). <!ELEMENT owner ANY>timeout: the time remaining until timeout of a lock. <!ELEMENT timeout (#PCDATA) >locktoken: the lock token associated with a lock; the href element contains the lock token. <!ELEMENT locktoken (href) >lockroot: the URL that was specified as Request-URI in the LOCK creation request; the href element contains the URL (see Section 2.5.3). <!ELEMENT lockroot (href) >As discussed above, the principal authenticated for the UNLOCK request MUST be allowed to remove the identified lock.Thanks !!

id=29446	Please provide a platform - independent function that determines if the userneeds support for AT tools. Accepted..according to the announcement on releases() this issuewill be re-targeted to OOo Later.IHMO, this belongs to the Framework -> changed component ...We no longer bridge to the Java accessibility API on Linux/Unix since OOo 2.0.3and will do so on Windows as well soon (IAccessible2).So the user will only need an accessible Java if (s)he runs code that uses JavaSwing, for which I think it is ok to have her/him go to Tools - Option - Java incase not all Java installations have accessibility enabled.I do not agree. An office could theoretically come with bundled extensions whichcould use swing. In this case, the disabled user would prefer that the officeuses a Java with accessibility bridge from the beginning. I admit that theusefulness of this function is now somehow less, but it is still there.Also, if we say that a Java with accessibility bridge will NOT be selectedautomatically anymore, then I would remove the code from the Java selection code(jvmfwk). Therefore I suggest to give this issue to user experience and havethey decide before I remove the respective code..To grep the issues easier via "requirements" I put the issues currently lying onmy owner to the owner "requirements".Update:1. On Windows, the bridge between the internal accessibility API and the Java Accessibility API is being replaced by (a bridge to) IAccessible2; seeand the plans for AOO 4.1. 2. If an extension uses Swing components instead of creating UI components through the UNO API, I think it should still implement the Java Accessibility API. Since Java 1.7 Update 6, the Java Access Bridge is being supplied as part of the JVM instead of a separate install (seeand). There may still be some issues with this solution, but the problem of a missing Java Access Bridge should slowly disappear.

The same happens in some other well-known spreadsheetapplications...BTW: Why don't you just use "MOD(R10*100;10)" or maybe combined with the ROUNDfunction: "ROUND(MOD(R10*100;10);0)"?This is RESOLVED?Huh?This code works exactly as it's supposed to in Excel. I've been using thespreadhseet for years to calculate online tax forms for our company. As soon asI switch to OpenOffice, boom, it stopped working.The MOD handles the floating point value just fine. By the time QUOTIENT getsit, the value has nothing to the right of the decimal place.I can send you the Excel spreadsheet if you don't believe me. I haven't changedit one iota since opening it in OpenOffice. I'm sure Bill Gates would besmiling if he read this.ROUND will not work. I'm looking for the exact digit, not a rounded one fromthe more significant column.I may have made a mistake somewhere, but I don't see how I could use it for solong and have it not work on the first try with OO, and have that be "just howit goes".Thank you for your time, as always.

I mean, nearly 7 months is a long enough delay, so see this as a reminder, please ... ;)Hi allI am using OO2.3 and have found out that ther is the same problemmy system is a winxp. i noticed the problem when i incerted a calculated number in to a textthis can be shown when you have the following spredsheetA1=200.2A2=200A3=A1-A2A4="A1-A3=" & A3A4 shows then A1-A2=0,199999999999989i hope this will helpTorstenCreatedExample for this bug under created under oo2.3I encountered this problem too. For instance, for the formula: MOD(0,21;0,1) theresult should be 0,01 but actually is 0,00999999999999998 when you increase the number of displayed digits appropriately.This is a problem, as QUOTIENT(MOD(0,21;0,1); 0,01) should be equal to 1, but is equal to 0 because of the problematic floating point representation.This issue still exists in OOo V.2.3 for windows. I haven't checked the linux version yet.I think, that it cannot be solved inside the code of MOD, because MOD cannotknow and cannot determine, how many decimal places you use in your decimalnumber. But you know it. And therefore you can round the intermediate result tothe correct amount of decimal places.For the example =QUOTIENT( MOD(* 100 ; 10 ) ; 1 ) the solution would be=QUOTIENT( ROUND(MOD(* 100 ; 10 )) ; 1 )For the example =QUOTIENT(MOD(0,21;0,1); 0,01) the solution would be=QUOTIENT(ROUND(MOD(0,21;0,1);2); 0,01)The general problem with precision with binary representation is already trackedin.Therefore I suggest to close this issue as WONTFIX, because there is nothing,what can be done inside the MOD-function. [I know the code of MOD, because Ihave worked on it recently (i59153) to fix an error with integral number indenominator.]
id=33466	Hi,I file this issue with the conversion tables between KPS 9566-2003(N. Korean national standard charset) and Unicode.I want KPS 9566-2003 to be accepted in OOo 2.0.KPS 9566-2003 is the advanced version of KPS 9566-97 and now is using in N. Korea.Regards,Kim CreatedCOnversion tables between KPS 9566-2003 & UnicodeHi Stephan,Will this make it into OOo2.0? We'd also need UI strings then for the encodingslistbox to be able to select the encoding. Liz has to be involved for herstrings approval after UI freeze, which in general isn't a problem for thelanguages and encodings listboxes.ThanksEikeTo Kim: Thanks for the attached conversion tables. Is there a URL where theyare available on the web (I add such URLs to the sal/textenc code whereavailable)? One minor problem with the attached conversion tables is that theymap unassigned characters to '?' (U+003F), so it is ambiguous whether a codemaps to '?' or is unassigned---I assume that the only real '?' in KPS 9566-2003is the single-byte character 0x3F. Also, from the given tables I guess that thecharacters in KPS 9566-2003 are single-byte characters in the range 0x00--0x7F,which map to the corresponding Unicode characters U+0000--U+007F, anddouble-byte characters in the range 0x8100--0xFEFF.To Eike: I'll add this for OOo2.0; Liz does not see any problems with adding anentry to the encodings listbox, either.Kim, could you please provide a plain text file encoded in KPS 9566-2003, sothat I can test that reading it into OOo more-or-less works (I will just checkthat it displays as lots of Korean glyphs, as I do not understand Korean, butsuch a test should be better than nothing).sb->liz: As discussed, we need a new string for the N. Korean text encoding"KPS 9566-2003." That string will appear in the "Character set" list box of the"ASCII Filter Options" dialog of the "Text Encoded (*.txt)" Writer filter(AFAIK, that is the only place it will appear; the source issvx/source/dialog/txenctab.src). I propose the following strings:English: "Korean (KPS 9566-2003)"German: "Koreanisch (KPS 9566-2003)"fixed; unit-tests in sal/qa/rtl/textenc/rtl_textcvt.cxx..Sorry, I have to turn this down. As an employee working for a US-based companythat is bound to US export control laws, I'm not allowed to assist in thedevelopment of versions tailored for users in US embargoed or sanctionedcountries, which North Korea unfortunately is.re-opening the issue with a question in response to sb's remarks :You personally as an employee and representative of Sun are not authorized, butwhat about someone else from the Community with integration and commit privileges ?Which bits of the software are forbidden from export ? As you may or may notknow, the export restrictions for embargoed countries only apply to thoseparticular bits of technology that expressly fall within the embargo's remit.Other questions : Is the embargo a pure US sanction or is it supported by a UN resolution ?The embargo must be identified somewhere as having been passed by Congress orthe US Dept of State - which resolution was involved (date and identification) ?If the primary servers holding the code were located outside of the US, theCommunity could avoid this issue. That probably wouldn't help matters for Sun,since it might still fall under the aiding and abetting or facilitating aspectof the embargo. While I can appreciate this, it would be nice to haveclarification on these different points.alexI'll just point out that OOo _currently_ offers language support for othercountries on the US Embargo List.extend cc list...So: what is the plan with this issue.

In Win XP noSP2 it worked okay if you follow my steps below.The 'bug' is that for all deselected modules the >Change< button is disabled.

id=39527	Why it's possible opening a Microsoft Office document with password but lateryou can only save it without password?In fact OpenOffice 1.9.65 says: " Password protection is not supported whendocument are saved in Microsoft Office format".It could be a good think to make able to do that...Thanks... Yes, this request is already signposted in the import password specification:I re-assign this to requirements.This is a show-stopper for my organization. I had hoped for at least a partialmigration to OOo, but the idea will never get past management without thisfeature. We are in healthcare and unfortunately users are used to using MS Wordpasswords to "secure" sensitive documents. I realize it's only an illusion ofsecurity, but it's just not something that is going to change. Therefore I needthis feature in order to sell an OOo conversion.Hopefully soon!I tried to introduce OOo2.0 (Build 8990) to my company. Unfortunately, the password protection is a big issue for our project and finance departments. We have to save password protected documents in xls and doc formats because the local government agences, audit companies and, our HQ in Japan is using Microsoft Office. Interoperatability in this area is a big let down. We won't migrate to Openfile format to enjoy the security features because our business partners are support Microsoft Office format.Hope you can understand...Please allow password protection for MS formats. This will allow gradual rollouts of OO. Without this feature we need to migrate everybody who shares pwd-protected documents at once. This is particularily painfull if users need to send pwd-protected docs across company borders.Thanks a lot for your excellent work!Forgot to mention that even specification recognises the need for such feature"User scenarios" in ttp://specs.openoffice.org/appwide/interoperability/Import_Password_Protected_MS_Office_Files.sxwDaniel, short questions: is it possible to implement this?

I gather a decision was madeto allow decryption, but not encryption of word-97 files, because the encryptionalgorithm is weak. That misses the point that people who are compelled to usethis silly format are therefore forced to revert to Word. The "save withpassword box" is still greyed out under FC11 pre-release / OO 3.1.0!!!Suggestions of using alternative encryption techniques completely miss thepoint.

id=39364	When viewing a document in OOo Writer, OOo always displays the page with aborder, just over the width of a toolbar, all the way round the document. Thecolour is specified by the "Application Background".I really can not see any purpose for this border and, since it is a waste ofscreen space and adds cluter to the interface, it would greatly enhance OOo ifit were removed. At least an option to get rid of it would be useful.I don't mean what the "Web Layout" option does, scaling the document to fit thescreen. I just mean use the application background where it IS necessary to fillspace to the right and/or below the document if it doesn't fill the area, justdon't put superfluous borders where they are not needed, and get in the way. This can be done in the Zoom options. Go to View.Zoom and selet "optimal". thisshould solve your problem.Closed.While the grey border is not on the screen when the zoom level is set tooptimal, it should be possible to view a document AT ANY ZOOM LEVEL, withoutbeing forced to view superfluous borders.

id=50997	So - I had a very quick look at the rules for .dpcc generation, and - well,perhaps it'd be easier for someone more familiar with them to fix this;Either way - 'makedepend' takes a very substantial time; particularly on Win32(where it helpfully prints 'makedepend' serially so you notice ;-), but also onUnix.tools/ compile:nodep=1 with dep generation:real 1m21.889s real 1m33.037suser 1m10.542s user 1m16.921ssys 0m8.237s sys 0m12.956sie. 11 seconds slower over 95seconds ~= 12% speedup.Of course - for the common 1st time build case, where there is no compiledobject file & => no question as to whether we have to build it or not, it makesgood time/space sense not to bother building & then checking large dependency files. since- there already is an option "nodep"- i wouldn't change the default to somethomg i connot recomend- the speed gain is quite low compared to the risk of an inconsistent buildthis results in a INVALID for me.So - interesting; when you say:What is the risk ? - my very limited understanding of these dependency files (ofwhich I have 7000 (.dpcc), consuming ~250Mb of space) is that they describewhich files are depended on by which other files & hence when a re-build shouldbe triggered for that file.ie. they help answer the question "should I re-build this file"All I am suggesting is that, for the 1st time build; when there is no objectoutput for this file anyway we could answer that question a little moreefficiently and speedily ;-)Of course - if you don't have dependencies (eg. after a nodep=1 build) - theywill be generated at the next build anyway; this seems to work quite nicely -so, I'm not 100% certain of the problem with recommending this etc. ?
id=25227	The Impress presentation attached to this issue causes a consistent, repeatablecrash with some recent versions of PowerPoint running on Windows and MacOS.Additionally, on several other PPT/OS combinations, the file opens but issignificantly mangled.This problem appears regardless of whether the export is done from OOo runningon Windows, Mac, or Linux.A detailed description (plain text), including build numbers and system details,is attached.The most closely related issues appear to be 8978, 9250, 17122, 19455, and22657, but none of those exactly matches what I'm seeing. My apologies inadvance if this is, in fact, a duplicate.Because I am only a submitter and not a developer, I've left this at the defaultpriority (P3). But if this is reproducible on the latest betas, I wouldrespectfully suggest it be raised -- since interoperability is arguably the mainreason for having OOo in the first place, this bug (which prevents thatinteroperability) would be a real show-stopper. CreatedOriginal OOo Impress fileCreatedDetailed summary and system infoReassigned to Christian.Tracked down the correct system info for case (3) in the summary attached above.- Operating system is WinXPPro (*not* Win2KPro as I said in the summary),version 2002, Service Pack 1, 5.1.2600 (build 2600).- PowerPoint is PPT 2002, build 10.2623.2625.- Behavior is correct as described (PPT crashes completely when trying to openthe Impress presentation attached above).WFM, however using PPT 2000, not 2002..detailed description follows:- Win98 SE German, Build 4.10.2222 A- MS Powerpoint __2000__ SR1 9.0.3821 German Version- OOo1.1.1b official windows build1) Opened file OOo1.1.0_PPT_export_problem.sxi in OOo2) Get dialog as: ".. This document contains macros: do you want to run them?.." - Do Not run2) Export as ppt-document from OOo3) Open with MS Powerpoint 2000 SR1 9.0.3821 German Version4) "Friendly Assistant" reports unknown file format (see attached screenshot)5) Click Ok - Exit PowerPoint - No CrashAlso attaching PPT-document generated by OO1.1.1b during this procedure.-> @Heywood: Maybe you can try this document with your PPT 2002?CreatedPPT 2000 reporting unknown fileformatCreatedoriginal sample document exported by OOo1.1.1bMax: Your observations are nearly consistent with what I wrote in my summary.The only significant difference is in my case (4): for me, PPT 2000 SR-1 underWIN2KPro SP4 (Build: 2195) opens but with the problems noted; for you, PPT 2000SR-1 under Win98SE doesn't open at all. But I didn't get a crash for thatcombination, and neither did you.When I open your exported (to PPT) document with OO 1.1.0, I see the exact sameproblems I described in my "sanity check" case (7).For what it's worth, I verified everything with 1.1.1b and saw no changes fromwhat I reported earlier. (There are other issues with build 680m22, but Ihaven't investigated those fully yet.)I see the bug in the attached document but I can't reproduce the bug with an owndocument.PPT2002 crash while loading the filePPT2000 - don't show me the content of slide 4, 19, 23, 24- slide 6 exists several timesin the outline.- some metafiles are invisible.Please have a look.I have encountered exactly this same problem with PPT files generated on Mac (OS X 10.2) and Pc (XP), trying to open them on both platforms.I am interested in getting this working for my own purposes, and wanted to help in any way I can. I have the PPT97 documentation from MS, but it seems to differ from both the format being output by current versions of powerpoint (even when saving as PPT97 format), and the code that is in use in OpenOffice already. Also their example code disagrees with their documentation, so the whole thing seems pretty much useless.I really need to get a solution that works in the next couple of weeks, and am prepared to help if I can - I could work on this pretty much full time for the next couple of weeks maximum, if I know what had changed between the old and new file format.Before finding the OpenOffice implementation, I was part way through doing an implementation in Objective-C, but was finding the differences between the MS documentation and the actual file format a real problem in the implementation.Please let me know if it is feasible to get this issue resolved that quickly, and if there is anything I can do to assist the process. My primary operating system is OS X, but I also have a win XP machine that I could use if necessary. I am fluent in Objective-C and Java and have had a small amount of exposure to C++ (hopefully enough to understand most of what's going on with the PPT exporter and make alterations as required).If it is not feasible to resolve it in that timeframe, I'll carry on with my C/Obj-C program.ThanksSJ->Heywood: First I must thank you for your good bug description. But I mustpoint out that I do not have a Mac and this makes it a little bit difficult forme to figure out the reason for the crash.But anyhow you said that some pages are completely empty if loaded in PowerPoint2000, I was able to reproduce this and I hope that fixing this Issue willresolve the problems for the other Windows PowerPoint versions.SJ->tompro:I appreciate that you offer to help out, especially you are working primary onOS X makes it very helpful.Heywood said that MacOS is crashing while converting metafiles, this seems to bea second bug, can you please verify this, I will add a zip file containing allmetafiles from the original PowerPoint document. I need to know if each Metafileis crashing the MacOS version or if it is a certain kind of Metafile. I alsoneed to know if simple documents (not containing OLE and too much objects)created by OOo load properly on MacOS.And you are right, the original PowerPoint file format description is containing some small untruths.Createdzip archive containing all metafiles from the original PowerPoint documentSJ->maxweber: PPT can not open documents that are already opened by anotherapplication, I think this was your problem.SJ: I split this issue, the problem that empty pages are displayed by PPT 2000or that the PPT XP version crashes will be fixed withwhich Itargeted to OOo 2.0. I also found the reason for the crash and empty pages, itis the disability of PPT to display grouped presentation objects (objects thatare part of the layout). Feel free to insert a CC to get further notioes.Up from now this Issue will handle only the problem the Mac OS PowerPointversion is having with ppt documents exported by OOo, therefore I changed the title.I have tried opening all of those WMF files in PPT, and none of them cause a crash (some of them come up blank though).I have done some more testing and it appears that the problem I was having on windows was due to the fact that I still had the presentation open in OO. The problem is not related to any graphics on slides. I have tried with the following procedure (as well as with files with some data in them):1. Create an empty presentation2. Select a blank slide3. Save as powerpoint format4. Try to open in PPT -> crashI have tried creating the files on OSX using OO1.0.3 and creating them on Win XP using OO1.1.0, and in both situations, the resultant files open fine on Windows, but not on the Mac.I have started to try to get my head around the file format, and one thing that is looking suspicious to me is the offset to the current edit in the current user record - but maybe I'm missing something there.I was wondering whether you could help me understand some specific things I have come across while trying to come to terms with the file format:1. It looks like all the atoms have to be padded to make them align to 32 byte boundaries - is this correct?2. In the current user atom, it appears that the user name has an 8 tacked on to the end of it - what is this for? I also notice that you put padding in before the user name - is this necessary?3. I don't quite understand the documentation for container lengths - is a container length determined by: sum(size of each atom including header) + (number of container objects inside this container * sizeof(Header)) + sizeof(Header for this container)? Or are some of these items left out?4. In the user edit atom, where does the 0x03000dbc come from for the version number?5. I don't get the offsetPersistDirectory and maxPersistWritten values and the PersistPtrIncrementalBlock - it looks to me like you keep track of positions of the atoms within the document stream, then write them out in a block at the end of the stream just before the current user edit record. But it doesn't look like the values that are recorded are always at the start of the record, or at the end. This one has me more confused than anything else I have looked at so far. I gather that when the docs refer to document and slide ids or numbers, these are references into this table - is this correct?6. I notice that you pad the user edit atom with 0x12 - is there any significance to this?7. I'm not sure that I understand the relationship between placeholders and the actual text and other objects on the slides. I guess I'll get to this when I understand the rest...8. I don't understand what goes into the pictures stream and how the items there are referenced for placement on the slides.Sorry about all the questions, but I would like to get up to speed as quickly as possible so that hopefully I can help resolving the mac ppt problem, and also accomplish my own goal, which is to be able to programmatically create a presentation with:- a slide with an image on it- slides with titles and indented bulleted text in specified fonts (must be able to handle unicode text)- slides with quicktime movies on them.TIASJ-> I am not a programmer so I can't help much with coding, but I have aPowerbook with 10.3.2 and Apple X11, so I would be happy to test/validate anypatches or fixes as they become available.tompro-> Note that the MacOS crash during metafile conversion (after opening thedocument) occurs on MacOS 9.2.2 and PPT 98 only. With PPT X on Mac OS 10.3.2, itjust crashes without opening anything.SJ and tompro-> Kudos for all your hard work so far -- of course one cannotexpect an immediate fix for something this complicated, but it looks like youguys are making significant progress. I will keep an eye onas well.Thanks!!!I have similar but perhaps not identical problems. Almost all of my OO1.1 presentations (from any OS) open fine with Powerpoint2002, but crash when loaded into MacOS X Powerpoint v.X. I *think* (but can no longer confirm) that this problem manifested itself onlyafter updating from Office v.X version 10.0 to the latest 10.0.5.I have found a workaround: since my documents load fine under Windows PPT 2002,if I save them there, I can then open them under MacOS.For what it's worth, most of these documents were originally created under Linux.I haven't yet tried to zero in on the problem. I certainly do use groupedobjects. In addition, I also use unicode fonts which I know v.X doesn't support.For 'fun', I will upload my own failing document...CreatedExported OO1.1 document that crashes MacOS PPT v.Xheywood->jaffe: can you try exporting my original OOo Impress file (firstattachment at top) to PPT and seeing if it crashes in your setup, with both PPT2002 (on Win? i can't tell from your post...) and v.X on Mac?if it doesn't crash, then something is wrong on my end. on the other hand, if itdoes, but most of your presentations work OK, then it must be something in mypresentation that is causing the problem. in that case, it may also make senseto post the additional information to, which is where the Windowsside of this problem was split off.jaffe -> heywood (and others)Here is the behavior I get with the original OOo Impress file:original file -- reads fine under Impress create OOo1.1.ppt -- saved from OO1.1 .sxi on OSX crashes WinXP PPT [this is new behavior, I think] crashes OSX PPT create OOo_sxi.1.1.ppt -- saved from OO1.1.ppt using OO on WinXP readable by WinXP PPT crashes OSX PPTcreate Oo_sxi.1.1_PC.ppt -- saved from OOo_sxi.1.1.ppt using WinXP PPT readable by WinXP PPT readable by OSX PPTSo -- except for the XP crash of the first ppt file, this is the same as I had been seeing. And at least there is a workaround -- the final version is readable on all machines and OSs.heywood->jaffe: Thanks for taking the time to check all the cases.This is exactly what I saw -- take a look at my summary (second attachment,above), cases 1 and 2, respectively.For your other two cases, essentially the workaround is to use OOo and/or PPT ona Windows box, which is OK provided the export from OO doesn't significantlymess up the appearance of any slides. Unfortunately this doesn't work for mewithout quite a bit of manual "fixing" on the exported (to PPT) document (seecases 4, 6, and 7 in the summary). Also, this workaround implicitly requires aPPT->OO import step, but that is also problematic for some documents (see issue23884).Cheers -Hchanged targetmarking as duplicate*** This issue has been marked as a duplicate of 72571 ***marked the wrong issue as duplicate, so reopening.It should be checked with OpenOffice.org 2.2rc3 or later to see if the problemstill exists.Heywood, can you test this issue with 3.0? Export filters contains lot ofchanges and I expect it should work now. Thanks.Glad to try it. One question -- the original bug was reported against OOorunning under Apple's X11 on Panther. I have Tiger now (and no easy way torevert to 10.3 for testing, though I assume that's not too critical) and, moreimportantly, only OOo 3.0 Aqua installed. Does this matter?No, it doesn't matter.

id=52703	When you open the table design for a embedded HSQLDB database, and have a"Integer" column with "Auto increment" = "Yes", then there is a field"Auto-increment statement", which is prefilled with "IDENTITY".Technically, this is fine and correct.From a user experience point of view, this is- disturbing: unexperienced users don't know what it is, and will be confused by it- useless: any other value than IDENTITY doesn't work, anywayI suggest to remove this field in the table design, if and only if thedatabase/type already prescribes which information would appear there.Please also update the specifiction atthen :) That is not correct.

As far as I recall, the set of available propertiesshould never change during the lifetime of a UNO object. Maybe the chart shouldthrow an IllegalArgumentException instead of an UnknownPropertyException.A similar problem occurs also with other properties but without exception: whenyou set the SymbolStyle at a chart that has no symbols, you don't see thechange, but internally the properties are stored, such that you see the changewhen you change the diagram type (which is not really possible via the API,because you have to create a new XDiagram and replace it at the ChartDocument).So an alternative would be to store the pending 3d attribute changes.I think we can close this issue.

In ODF and Apache OpenOffice, encryption is password-based and there is no provision for Public Key Cryptography to be used at all.For signing, there is provision for PKC, as in the current support for X.509. So this will be a separate issue for an indefinite time. In this case, accommodation of PGP signing will depend on two provisions: Including OpenPGP information in the XML Digital Signature used in the ODF Format and relying on the PGP libraries that are already installed on an user's computer so that the signatures can be produced and so they can be verified.

As you can see, the docking framedoes not vanish which indicates that the toolbar will be docked after releasingthe left mouse button, although CTRL is hold down. ssa->tm: please confirm and decide about a target, pl would be the owner then.Confirming with 2.2 on WinXP.Not reproducible in a more recent build like a m217 anymore -> worksformeStill occurs in m218. Reopening.TM->kpalagin: I can't reproduce it with a recent build on WinXP. When dragging afloating toolbar into the docking area, a docking-frame is shown. When pressingCTRL while dragging a floating toolbar into the docking area, no docking-frameis shown,...releasing CTRL shows the docking-frame at once. Please provide moreinformation which may help me to reproduce the problem. Thanks in advance !tm,as described in first post - - make sure there is a floating toolbar (for example undock Pages in Draw)- hold down CTRL- move the toolbar over the docking-area (while still holding the left mousebutton down)- release CTRL:No docking frame is shown. The mouse has to be move a bit to allow docking.OK, I see,....a bit... a really, really little bit. I think it's only 1 dot,but you're right !TM->CD: please have a look. I set target to 2.xPlease don't forget the second bug desycribe in my initial comment!Would it be better to use this issue for the first bug only and I post thesecond bug into a second issue?cd->pl: Please take over. Looks like the VCL based docking code doesn't call thehandlers when the CTRL-key is pressed or released (it always needs mousemovement to call the handlers).Is this bug related toand/or?targetPhilipp,are we on track for 3.0 with this problem?Thanks in advance.WBR,KP.pl->tm: cannot reproduce in 680m247, neither Linux nor Windows nor Mac/Aqua. Thedocking frame appears/disappears depending on Ctrl being pressed, also withoutmouse movement.It turns out that no docking is possible when "Show window contents" is disabled - docking frame does not appear.Ctrl indeed works.show window contents while dragging must be set on to for having this featureworking corectly. So this behaviour is not a defect. Setting issue to"worksforme" and closing !Both problems described in the initial comment are still present.tested build: DEV300 m19 Linux"show window contents while dragging" IS ENABLED!Please read issues more carefully before setting WORKSFORME!!!-> REOPENEDtm, feel free to ask me if you have difficulties in reproducing the steps.Changed target to 3.x.
id=53513	It's great to be able to assign keyboard shortcuts to styles, but it would be agreat improvement if we could do it from within the style creation window sothat a keyboard shortcut would be part of the style definition itself.That way, the shortcuts would be saved with the style definitions themselves.This would make it much easier to share templates them with others users. Forexample, I created a screenwriting template that works very well, but people Ishare it must manually reassign all the shortcuts; which in a way defeats thepurpose of creating the template.Thanks,Daniel Landry Reassigned to ES.ES->FL: as discussed. This is already planed but we have no task for this yet.Changed owner.duplicate, feature present in OOo 2.x*** This issue has been marked as a duplicate of 4686 ***did not read carefully enough.But I don't know whether this is usefull - I bet it will confuse lot of users.I was just confused because I could _not_ change the shortcut for a template asI can do it in Word... I'd find it much more intuitive to assign a shortcut viathe style dialog than via the well-hidden and overcrowded keyboard dialog. Andwhy not allow two different ways to do it? Glad this feature is planned.
id=56348	New Hungarian breakiterator patch() contains some Unicodecharacters in first letter position in words (ALetter). Breakiterator doesn'thandle these Unicode characters.

id=56960	I am not sure whether this is a bug or a feature, for me it is a bug. When I use Save as... I mostly want to save the current document in a different location, not with a different filename. However, if I use Save as... I get the KDE-save-dialogue without the filename of the current document, so that I have to type it again. Even in case I d/l something off the web I want to use Save as... in order not to save it to some temp-dir and not becaue I want to give it a new filename, so giving a blank filename when using the Save as... dialogue does not make sense to me. Might be that this is not a KDE-integration issue, yet since I only use that version, I could not test it, so please re-assign, if this happens with the standard OO-version too. I've just tested it both in OOo 2.0 and SRC680_m134, and I've had the document filename pre-filled in the dialog. Please try with OOo 2.0 - and if you still see the behaviour, please reopen the issue.I use 2.0.0.1 and when I click on "Save As..." the filename is still there, but as soon as I click on any icon on the speedbar, or the arrow-up-button to change the dir, the filename is gone.This feature/bug was already implemented, and this issue should be closed.

Other users reported that itworked for them. Andreas, please take care. The real problem for us is that we do not have a testenvironment for proxy authentication.I use DicOOo to check if internet connection works.An interesting fact is that with activated proxy (as shown in the attached screenshot "OOo config 2") the connection retries run much faster than with disabled proxy.This makes me believe that OOo can physically connect to the proxy but cannot authenticate.Some more comments: - Desired behavior is that OOo once displays a login dialog asking for usernameand password for the proxy server. - There is no possibility to enter proxy authentication information somewhere inthe user settings of OOo. This might get considered a missing feature, but isunrelated to this issue.KSO->ABI:- One of the potential problems that we might have here is a missing InteractionHandler."Generally OOo does support proxy authentication."How can the users specify the username and password? Should OOo open a request window?I would prefer edit fields in the proxy settings for username/password instead of popup request window.Furtheron support for proxy configuration scripts should be implemented. But that's another issue.It looks like other users have similar problems:quotation from there:"We have a Windows network and not a direct connection to the internet, but we have web-access throu a proxy. I tried to set the proxy settings to manual (with the correct data in the fields) and i tried to set it to system, but nothink works."(But it looks like that user would mean that this is a regression bug of OOo 2.0As far as I remember I had the same problems with OOo 1.x versions; so I don't think that this is a regression.

id=60692	Apparently, for declarations that are not definitions, like /** ... */ struct UnoVoidType;no documentation is generated. That causes documentation to be missing forentities from cppu/unotype.hxx. It is (of course) a feature that forward declarations can not hold documentation.One reason is that documentation for one entity should not be scattered overseveral files. After all it is in-code documentation, too. And when reading thecode, the natural place to look for a documentation is at the entitiesdefinition, not at one of possibly many forward declarations.As the entities in unotype.hxx are defined nowhere else, I'd suggest to justdefine them empty:struct Xyz {};Then documentation will be generated.That does not convince me. Think about a case where there is a declaration ofan entity in a file that is processed by autodoc, while the definition of theentity is in another file that is not processed by autodoc. If you want toavoid documentation on "forward declarations," you might change autodoc so thatit ignores documentation for the declaration of an entity if and only if autodoccomes across either more than one declarations of that entity that hasdocumentation, or a definition of that entity that has documentation, or both.In this case one processes the file with the definition.However, I suggest to stay with the actual use case. It is good programmingpractice to keep things simple, standard and unmistakable. Having undefinedstructs looks strange at least. If one wants to do something real with the template, they are parameters to, Iam not even sure, if it is correct to leave them undefined, when the template isinstantiated. What is the C++-standard paragraph allowing this? And even (as Iassume) if you made sure, this is correct - can we be absolutely sure that in nofuture use case those structs may need a definition anyway? Besides, if one defines those structs as empty, one can even avoid half of thecomment (the part that they are not defined and why).Looking at all that, what is the reason to leave these struct undefined?<quote>In this case one processes the file with the definition.</quote>Huh? We only process headers and not implementation files.<quote>Having undefined structs looks strange at least.</quote>That might be your personal opinion. However, the idea of information hiding iswell established, even in C++ circles. The current implementation of autodocdoes not take this into account (it equally fails to work for cases where theclass definition is hidden in an implementation file and for cases where thereis no class definition at all).<quote>What is the C++-standard paragraph allowing this?</quote>14.3.1/2<quote>Looking at all that, what is the reason to leave these structundefined?</quote>There is no reason to have them defined.Autodoc processes any given file as long as it contains valid C++ declarations.The parameter -f <filename> parses files regardless of extension.<quote>Looking at all that, what is the reason to leave these structundefined?</quote>That IMO is not enough. This is no defect, but a feature request. The feature to comment forwarddeclarations is undesirable in Autodoc as it invites to spread documentationover several places.In the concrete case there was no disadvantage given of defining the structsempty. But advantages can be given: It is easier to for maintainers to recognizethe construct with one look. Also it is more robust in case of future changesthat may need a definition of these types.Last not least: The effort to define those structs is 5 minutes. The effort toimplement the (also IMO undesirable) feature, is several hours.So, if there are no new reasons, I'd suggest to not do this.Interfaces indeed use to have the need to document incomplete types ininterfaces without uncovering the type's definition. So reopened.retarget
id=59942	A multi-page table breaks over each page. The reader has no idea what is thesubject of the table till he sees its caption. But this caption could be several pages away, at the top (or the bottom) of thetable.The problem is worse if the file contains multiple such tables (and if they lookidentical in structure). In this case, the reader would have difficulty inlocating the current table's caption; and he may end up reading some othertable's caption!To increase readability, Writer should insert the table's caption on each page.Note: The caption on each page should have some additional words that indicatethat the table continues on the next page.For example, "(Continued..)"(See, which has a related suggestion.) according toRFE_issues_by_QA.sxd I reassign this issue to requirements and set the status to Newworksforme.This feature is already present and enabled in a default OOo-version.(Distributors may have different defaults)Use Table|Table Properties → textflow and check [x] repeat headingFor the other point (kind of indicator "continue on page...") seeRaindrops -> clopsAre you sure you get the CAPTION on each page?

id=60696	So - the attached patch is a tad of a hack - clearly advice wrt. re-factoringmuch appreciated. The main part of the hack is 2-fold:a) using a far simple mangling than md5 for the pipe hash (so this can bereplicated easily & with few dependencies outside OO.o)b) writing startup progress information to a pipe using fprintf - c'est la vie.Improvements appreciated.It's behavior is obvious - and follows from the win32 work in this area. Itgives a very substantial 2nd startup time win - and also shows the splash wayearlier than an equivalent stock OO.o launch.To make it work - it's necssary to have a number of wrappers eg.'oowriter':#!/bin/shexport OOO_EXTRA_ARG=-writer/usr/lib/ooo-2.0/program/ooqstartfor each component (at least - that's how we use it).We use the Gtk+ toolkit to throw up the splash - however, it's not initializedbefore the pipe-work is done; so it has no performance impact really.The use of gtk+ has 2 nice properties:a) Startup-notification - getting this right is mandatory, gtk+ includes code todo that - avoiding that being re-written.b) Splash dithering - on 16bit displays a detailed/gradient splash looksshockingly bad when rendered by the OO.o code - since there is no dithering,gtk+ has code to do that rather nicely - (at least in theory) - possibly we needto do work here to use DITHER_MAX - but, Anyhow - patch attached.

That was just the intention of the win32 loaders, to have asmall and fast binary that just passes the command line parameters and shows thesplash screen without any overhead.

F.e. actually the pipename is generatedfrom the userid + userpath. To prevent the same user configuration to be usedfrom different concurrent processes there's also a lock mechanism that verifieswether the user data is already used by a process on a different machine.Beside that user data is not a good criteria to differentiate between twoinstances (installation dir would be better) $DISPLAY should also be included inthe pipe name (or session id on non Linux platforms, as Terminal Server orSunRays). Actually if you open a second display on the same machine and start asecond office with the same userid, the windows will pop up in the other display- not was is desireable..On Mon, 2006-02-06 at 17:37 +0000,wrote:@mmeeks: You got it.

Or - failing that, a more table-driven approach with a nice shared struct in aheader that annotates arguments with eg. 'unsigned int nosplash_with_this_one :1;' That sort of thing ;-) clearly having 3 separate argument parsers doesn't helpanyone.Let me take your patch as a source base for further i9mprovements as I'mGreat :-) it's certainly in need of some more love: urgh - particularly, youdon't want the version actually filed in that patch ! - it has tons of hideous bugs. Can you poke at theversion instead ?that fixes a number of nasty issues - argument paths etc. F.e. actually the pipename is generatedSure - I still fret about that; AFAICS the factory is there not just forperformance but also to protect the config data - so perhaps using the path tothat config data is the right thing ? but of course, then the multi-displayangle immediately breaks that anyway ;-)$DISPLAY should also be included inWell - yes; of course DISPLAY should be mangled in - but OTOH we never did thatin the past. Also *HEALTH WARNING* ;-) there are serious problems with DISPLAY, that we havesuffered in GNOME for some years ;-) eg. on a single-user, 1 display box theseDISPLAY values are all equivalent: DISPLAY=':0' DISPLAY=':0.0' DISPLAY='localhost:0' And the 1st two are in fact remarkably common; and this is of course withoutssh -Y localhost type problems ;-) ie. the whole '1 activation per display' ideais acutely complicated & unpleasant and there is no good way to do this.Unfortunately - you have to connect to the given display and poke around at rootwindow properties to have anything reliable: not something we want to do in afast-quickstarter and not so useful for the common case.

So this can't be integrated into themaster now.So I understand that this patch needs some additional work.Hennes, could you be a bit more specific what has to be done before it can beintegrated (in whatever release)?hro: eg. we could cut/paste the md5sum code & write a very simple cut/downbootstraprc parser to use the same pipe path if you really want - to furtherreduce footprint / impact.cd: It seems you have been working on the splash code recently - any chance to have a look at these patches as well, please?cd->kendy: I cannot comment to your gtk specific changes as I am not familiarwith X/gtk. You have to wait for HRO. You now have to two different approaches(Unix/Windows) to create the pipe name. I am not sure, but I think there aresome external application which uses the pipe to check if an Office is currentlyrunning. They would have to change their code in a platform specific manner. Ithink this is not really acceptable. I am also not sure that using only theapplication path as the pipe name is a good idea. A second user wouldn't be ableto to start the Office using the same installation. It should be clear that thecurrent Office implementation needs exclusive write access to the user datadirectory. A second Office instance using the same user data directory wouldresult in a nightmare. The pipe communication between starter and splash screenservice looks ok, although we should prevent to use #ifdef UNX in non-platformspecific code. Why cannot you use osl here? I can see that HRO already added hisconcerns about your patch. I fear we have to wait for HRO (currently he is illand will be available start of August) and discuss the feature in detail.hro, cd: wrt. the #ifdefs, would it be acceptable for you to implement another splash UNO service for the external splash that would be used in case -splash-pipe= argument was present? The current implementation does not break the Win32 build, but this could be cleaner, right?hro: wrt. comments from mmeeks Wed Apr 26 01:23:34 -0700 2006, is it really needed?Please, are these two the only concerns, or did I forget something? Thank you in advance!OK - so I updated the patches to implement "com.sun.star.office.PipeSplashScreen" service - it is a SplashScreen that does not render any output, just sends the progress values back to the external splash process that started OOo. This service is used just in case -splash-pipe= argument is present. The sources::Implements the tiny executable (ooqstart) that draws the splash screen, creates the pipe and starts OOo.:Implementation of the PipeSplashScreen service.:Build bits, choose PipeSplashScreen when -splash-pipe=XYZ is present, make the progress bar going more smoothly, fix Set/GetStringParam(), ...:Install bits.I can also have a look at the second problem - if it stops the integration. Does it?cd->kendy: I am sorry, but I am very busy with OOo 2.0.4 show stoppers.The pipe service is an important step for a platform independent solution for anexternal startup executable. I know that you are only interested into a Unixsolution, but I think we should have a solution ready for all platforms(including Windows). CWS splashperform has a Windows prototype which also needsa way to communicate with the splash executable.I don't quite understand what you're saying here. Are you saying that we shouldblock platform specific unix-only improvements until Win32 versions can becreated ? [ that would be an incredible view IMHO ].cd: I am sorry, but nonavailability of the Win32 implementation is not an argument ;-) Win32 system file picker was implemented far before there was one for Gnome/KDE; it would be ridiculous to block it on availability of them...From what I see in CWS splashperform, there's no communication between the splash process & OOo there yet, right? I'm quite sure the idea of PipeSplashScreen could be re-used even there - as the -splash-pipe= you can use whatever works on Win32 (I guess it has something like the unx pipes?) & implement an own PipeSplashScreen service for Win32. Or the switch can be simply renamed later if you need something other than a pipe (eg. to -splash-communication= together with renaming the service to ExternalSplashScreen). It is just an internal parameter, and the user is not supposed to even know about its existence anyway.And - of course I do not expect this to get into 2.0.4, we are behind a feature-freeze - but it would be really great to see it in early 2.0.5, ASAP after branching for OOD680 - so that we had more testers after the recent changes. (We have already quite lot of them for the previous implementation - all the SUSE 10.1 & SLED 10 users :-) )I've updated the patches to create exactly the same OSL pipe as OOo currently does (the md5 one). The patches are here:The description is above in comment from kendy Fri Aug 4 07:57:20 -0700 2006.BTW, is that bug or feature that the md5 sum is not really a md5 sum if there are numbers < 0x10 in the OSL pipe name? I mean eg. aa0bcc is shortened to aabcc...hro, cd: The deadlines for 2.1 are approaching - any chance to have a look at the recent version of the patches & approve them, please? ;-) I can do the CWS, etc. if you do not have a suitable one.Thank you!As it looks your patch only works if the bootstraprc does only containSYSUSERCONFIG but no other variables. There are a lot of more bootstrapvariables that could be used here. The problem is that to support all possiblevariables you have to write a lot of code - or you can link against sal and usethe existing functionality there (perhaps sal could be linked statically?!).Another missing feature is that you need to evaluate the command line as itmight contain a value for the "UserInstallation" variable that overwrites thevalue from bootstraprc.wrt. the bug in the MD5 hash: this is a known issue (though only available inour inhouse bugtracking system).We can't fix it without creating problems for other apps (unopkg, setup and any3rd party software relying on the pipe name to detect a running instance), atleast we should reserve the fix for a major release.mba: thanks for the great feedback: "or you can link against sal and use the existing functionality there (perhaps sal could be linked statically?!)."This was my preferred solution when the use of the Pipe & md5 code was mandated,unfortunately - as soon as you use certain parts of sal (anything stringrelated) you pull in a huge chunk of code [ I guess the textenc stuff ], andyour 'small' quick-starter baloons from 40k -> 2Mb ;-) so it's not feasible.Indeed - you could question -why- we have 1.6Mb of 'textenc.o' linked into our(~2Mb) platform library, the vast majority of which is never used in any locale;-) The vast majority of strings are either UTF-8 or ASCII on my system. [performance wise we should prolly try to re-factor that out, it'd be interestingto see how much ISO12345 stuff is used in .de / .european locales too ? - atleast on Unix the world is going UTF-8 fast ].Would linking sal dynamically really hurt ? The exports out of that are c onlyand it is comparable in size to the X11 library itself. And then there is gtkwith its 3MB not counting its dependencies. I guess the splash would show up alittle later, but would it matter whether this is in 25 milliseconds or 75 ?Personally I'd say, no, the smallest thing a user can notice is ~50 ms anyway.But perhaps the numbers are different, if so please tell.Just an idea :-)I already link to sal statically (see desktop/unx/source/makefile.mk) to get the md5 digest. Unfortunately, using more is not possible - once I use part of the code that accesses OUString/rtl_ustring, all the conversion tables get in and I end up with >2M stripped binary (I've tried that already) which is not an option for a lightweight (quick)starter.So - I have to copy the functionality I'm afraid.OK.Anything more I should be aware of, please?pl: X11 is in the memory for sure, glib most probably as well (and has just libc as a dependency), sal is not in the cold-start case; so it still takes some time to load it (though I have no numbers to show, unfortunately). Linking it statically would be better, but 2M still too much from my point of view...(I forgot to emphasize that the current implementation does not link to Gtk+, just to glib which is ~500k & dependent just on glibc.)Michael, Kendy, would you consider the option to factor out the conversiontables? Would be interesting to see why they are it is pulled in when you useany string functions.Or should we go for the dynamic linking and try out how much milliseconds wehave to pay for it?A small test on Windows revealed that after removing all textenc functions fromthe export and the textenc.lib from the makefile map the following symbols showup as unresolved:sal.lib(thread.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol_rtl_getTextEncodingFromWindowsCodePage referenced in function_osl_getThreadTextEncodingsal.lib(nlsupport.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol_rtl_getTextEncodingFromWindowsCodePage sal.lib(ustring.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol_rtl_destroyTextToUnicodeConverter referenced in function _rtl_string2UStringsal.lib(uri.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol_rtl_destroyTextToUnicodeConvertersal.lib(ustring.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol_rtl_convertTextToUnicode referenced in function _rtl_string2UStringsal.lib(uri.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol_rtl_convertTextToUnicodesal.lib(ustring.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol_rtl_createTextToUnicodeConverter referenced in function _rtl_string2UStringsal.lib(uri.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol_rtl_createTextToUnicodeConvertersal.lib(string.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol_rtl_destroyUnicodeToTextConverter referenced in function_rtl_impl_convertUStringToStringsal.lib(uri.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol_rtl_destroyUnicodeToTextConvertersal.lib(string.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol_rtl_convertUnicodeToText referenced in function _rtl_impl_convertUStringToStringsal.lib(uri.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol_rtl_convertUnicodeToTextsal.lib(string.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol_rtl_createUnicodeToTextConverter referenced in function_rtl_impl_convertUStringToStringsal.lib(uri.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol_rtl_createUnicodeToTextConvertersal.lib(string.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol_rtl_getTextEncodingInfo referenced in function _rtl_impl_convertUStringToStringWe could consider to put textenc into a separate library that will be loaded ondemand, at least for these functions. The functions in sal would just bewrappers around the load-on-demand call.To keep the sal library compatible we must do the same for the other 15 symbolsfrom textenc also. Shouldn't be a lot of work and we would never need to loadthe tables as long as nobody needs to convert anything than UTF-8.ccing meAh - so tooling is everything ;-) if you poke at- there is a (Linux only) tool that showsobject size breakdown by source directory: eg. you can look at 'svx' and say:wow that is a big pile of code, then break it down by source directory andsource file to find the offendors (some of which are quite suprising); anyhow itshows:michael@t60p:/opt/OpenOffice/ood680-m4/sal/textenc>/opt/OpenOffice/HEAD/bin/oosize --lsFound module '/data/OpenOffice/ood680-m4/sal'Size breakdowncontext.c 664tenchelp.c 1036unichars.c 1064textcvt.c 1128converter.c 1144convertsinglebytetobmpunicode.cxx 1244converteuctw.c 2140convertgb18030.c 2176tcvtutf8.c 2176convertiso2022kr.c 2316convertiso2022jp.c 2340convertbig5hkscs.c 2420tcvtutf7.c 2428tcvtmb.c 2728convertiso2022cn.c 3472tcvtbyte.c 3672tencinfo.c 9108textenc.cxx 1490820so - as you see, 1 file is a huge proportion of the problem here; luckily thatfile exports only 1 symbol ;-)ImplTextEncodingData const *Impl_getTextEncodingData(rtl_TextEncoding nEncoding)By commenting out the contents of that I get:1797832 ../../unxlngi6.pro.before/lib/libuno_sal.so 273544 libuno_sal.so # afterSo - AFAICS this is really the obvious place to cut to loose 85% of the code ata single stroke ;-) [ of course, we'd prolly need to re-instate / in-line atleast some of the common ASCII / common Win32 code-page / UTF8 stuff ] but itshould be fairly trivial to save a nice whack of code there in the common case.I'm even interested enough to have a go myself now ;-)cloned grist of the sal shrink to i#70166#kso->all: hro is currently sick and will not be available before January 2007.That's why there is currenly no activity from hro here.I think "porting" is the best matching component and it better matches thepeople working on this issue.Hope I'll have enough resource to get this integrated for next minor relase on amultiplatform basis.I won't just apply the patch without implementing this for Windows too andwithout deep testing in different configurations (Terminal Server, Sun RayServer etc.)There was already another task where a patch like this worked on Linux butWindows functionality was broken afterwards and not detected for over 6 month.textenc and other stuff from sal is not really needed. Bootstraprc actually isonly used by the patch to find the userinstallation path as it's part of thepipe name.But the userinstallation path in the pipe name IMHO is a bug.Pipe should be created from <program installation path>+<userid>+<display/session>So there's no need to reso9lve any bootstrap variables.Yes there are some tools (like unopkg etc.) that have to be adjusted too butactually they rely on an implementation detail of a different module (which isthe next design bug).I don't like duplicating code (including the above mentioned). What I would liketo see is a small piece of code that generates the pipe name and is linkedagainst all other modules statically.A good place for this is sal/systool. The output should be a static lib whichonly uses native system code. sal, the splashloader, desktop and other modulesshould link against this library.hro: an issue of incredible infamy: it got QA on Win32, but we didn't detectthat - and, as you say - it was so critical it took 6 months to find ;-)wrt. the patch - yes, we were blocking on re-writing this for you using 'sal',blocking on fixing the sal bloat issues mainly; since that is now ~mostly doneit should be child's play to make an efficient 2nd starter based on our work [ Iguess ] that is except for the native splash code :-)***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***Setting the target for 2.4 at least.I really really want this feature but I'm not sure whether it can be realizedwithin 2.3 time line.Performance is not only the startup time until the user can work with OOo butthe time until he get's the first UI feedback. For a desktop application quickresponsivenesses is as important as pure performance.There are several design issues that have to be addressed beside the simple taskof implementing a working splashscreen along with a native pipe connection.The key is creating the right pipename based on the right variables which dependon the scenario where OOo is used.My quick suggestions:Desktop scenario pipe name = System User ID + Program Installation Path +Normalized Display/Session (no need for bootstrap variable resolution)For other scenarios the pipename may be constructed bySystemUserID + UserInstallation Path + some context information.I'd like to look at the design from a more abstract view: Given a scenario forOOo - what information is needed to find the intended running process to connectto ?So first I want to collect all scenarios:- OOo as single user/multi user desktop office suite- OOo as UI-less server- OOo as a plugin in other applications- ...@kso: Need some input about the possible scenarios and what is intended how OOoshould behave from an abstract point of view regardless of any currentlyimplemented bootstrap mechanism.@mmeeks: Taking your patch and what is in my mind I guess I'll have to changedesign a little bit. But the "core implementation" stuff of your patch seems tobe usable.hro: I don't understand one thing ;-) It is a patch that we use for ages in all our products; also Debians and the other distros do. Why don't you just take it as it is, ship it with 2.3, and do the redesign for 2.4 (which is in about 9 months if I count correctly) as you like it?When it is up-stream, it decreases our maintenance burden, the users have the feature, you can do the redesign - everyone is happy...hro: I'm not aware of -any- Unix application that has succesfully solved all theuse-cases for a factory process, and (as I say), many of them are extremelynon-trivial.It seems a shame to defer any integration until the impossible is achieved.Clearly the code needs re-writing to use sal/ such that we don't change the pipename, or the way the current code works. Can we not split the blue-sky"fix-all-possible-problems" part of this into some other task & not tie theintegration of this to that ?@kendy, @mmeks:Guys - do you really want me to integrate this into the master just because it runs well with your OOo distribution ?Without ensuring that other currently working scenarios won't break ?You think it's a shame that I don't integrate it because I KNOW that at least for the bootstrap variables the patch will definetly break existing functionality that is already used ?I should integrate it, introduce some regression and fix it afterwards because your distribution will not be affected by the regression regardless what happens to other users of OOo that use it in a different scenario that's currently working ?You must be kidding ;-)What we can do is:1) Collect and define the currently working scenarios2) Test your patch on a CWS and see which scenarios will break (and there will be at least 2 scenarios I'm aware of).3) Find a solution how to fix the problems detect at 2).>Heh, how much time does it take to do so? Definitely not 9 months to 2.4 ;-)What _exactly_ do you mean? Did you see my most recent changes (well, recent, from Tue Aug 22 14:46:11 +0000 2006) that use bootstraprc and exactly the same OSL pipe as OOo without the external splash [even with the bug in storing the md5sum in some cases]. Please tell me which variables/scenario _exactly_ break and I'll fix it. So far I've heard just that commandline can contain value that overrides the 'UserInstallation' variable [fixable in about the same time you can write me 'Fix it for me please']; other cases were just 'I know of scenarios' without actually telling them.Of course - we can statically link to the entire sal [patch to do so is an easy homework doable in few hours] if we agree that the slight ugliness in issue 70166 is worth it.Yes, perfectly OK for me. Let's say this can take 2 mandays of your work; I guess you don't expect _us_ to collect the scenarios, right? ;-)1 manday.Exactly, please!3 mandays.Even if this is too optimistic, we can have it in a month at most, or not?kendy,Unfortunately not, I'm afraid. hro is on vacation this week and he has a lot ofother duties to attend to when he is back. He cannot immediately start workingon this issue. It's a question of (yes, even sun-internal) priorities. Sorry.kso: Hahahaa! :-)) I would be weeping if this were not sooo funny.Of course I don't want him to start immediately, I want more - this bug should have been solved for several months already... Users would have the experience of seemingly better cold start, and really faster start of 2nd, 3rd, etc. instances [== with QuickStarter it is every case] in _your_ product, I could focus on another tasks, hro as well, etc. And all this with just few hours of your work on a feature on which we spent ~50 hours. Or should we bring you every feature that makes our product better on a silver plate? ;-)@kendy: For just one platform with just one use case 1 manday of testing may beright. But OOo is not just designed for one use case on one single platform.I've already seen the last patch from Aug, 22th, but MBA already stated what'smissing. The pipe name will only be the same if you don't touch the bootstraprcand don't make use of -env switch. The patch just works for the "default" usecase - not more.1. Link against SAL and use rtl/bootstrap functions to support full bootstrapvariable support2. Support -env command lineLinking against SAL is not what I would prefer - I already stated what kind ofaproach would be better. But if you want it to get into the master quickly without finding dedicatedsolutions for each use case we must ensure that there will be no regressions.If you agree with this quick approach please come along with an adjusted patch.Regarding the "silver plate" - you know - you got 10 million lines of workingcode on a silver plate too ;-)The problem is that developing a prototype that works with 90 percent of the usecases takes 10 percent of development time. The other 90 percent of time areused to fix the missing 10 percent and make it reliable, maintainable.Regardless whether this relation is 90/10 or 70/30 - this is common softwaredevelopment knowledge. Writing a prototype is always fast, easy and verysatisfying ;-)Second quick approach:As I understand the patch ooqstart is the loader used for system integration andfor starting OOo within your distribution. The existing soffice.bin code ismostly untouched with just minor changes when updating the splash screen andinstantiating a splashscreen service.So with your distribution if you start soffice.bin with a modified bootstraprc(UserInstallationPath != SYSUSERCONFIG) and start ooqstart afterwards you willget a second instance and will not find the running soffice.bin process.So would it be O.K. to leave the patch as it is but don't use ooqstart in theofficial OOo build or advertise it as a goody with the hint "this only works ifyou don't touch the bootstraprc and user configuration resolving will bedisabled/not working" ?hro: First of all, I apologize for my offending statements; I suddenly got very angry that this issue takes so much time to solve.I'll update the patch(es) to align with 1) and 2), and also I'll rename the 'ooqstart' binary to 'oosplash' - it better describes what it does. As long as it is not called from 'soffice' or the .desktop files, this feature will be available only to ones who know about it - and thus further reducing the risk for the users.Ping.Any news on this issue ?hro: Sorry, I've been distracted by other tasks a bit :-( I'll do the changes as promised on Jun 14, 2007 as soon as possible, hopefully until the end of the week. The code is under the JCA, and I really want to see it finally up-stream :-)hro: Committed to CWS unxsplash2.Please review the code, now it links just to SAL and X11, no glib dependency any more. [Thanks to linking to SAL, it should also solve the -env: thing.] I have also enabled it in soffice.sh so that it is used by default - if you don't agree & should it prolong the integration, I'll disable it there. [But of course, from my point of view it is better to be 'on' in the Dev builds so that we can uncover problems if any.]I also had to convert the intro.bmp's that are in the OOo CVS to 24bit TrueColor, the code cannot handle Palette. If you want smaller intro bitmaps, I'll extend oosplash.bin to handle .png's in a follow-up CWS; extending the bmp reading is not the right way, the PNG is still nearly 1/3 of the paletted BMP.Also, please could you recommend me a QA person? I hope a buildbot will be able to provide me with an install set...Reassigning to Eric, our QA guy.Installsets are available as:Specification:I was able to successfully install and run the topten QATESTTOOL tests on boththe Windows and Linux Unxsplash2 CWS builds without any issues. Below are thebuilds I used for my testing:I was also able to successfully start soffice (which on Linux exercisedoosplash) under the following conditions:xnest window (DISPLAY=:22.0)vnc session (DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:1.0)Windows XP using 16 bit colorWindows XP using 24 bit coloropenSUSE 10.3 GNOME session using 15 bit coloropenSUSE 10.3 GNOME session using 24 bit colorUnder the openSUSE 10.3 Linux system I tested to make sure that the followingcommands worked correctly when no soffice.bin process was running as well aswhen an existing process was already running:soffice -writersoffice -calcsoffice -impresssoffice -dbasesoffice -minimizedsoffice -invisiblesoffice -norestoresoffice -quickstartsoffice -nologosoffice -nolockchecksoffice -nodefaultsoffice -headlesssoffice -helpsoffice -hsoffice -?soffice -osoffice -nsoffice -displaysoffice -viewsoffice -showThe commandline options that failed for me when no soffice processes was alreadyrunning were:soffice -p <document>soffice -pt <printername> <document>I also ran into problems with the application not starting on the correctDISPLAY only when I had the same user logged into two sessions at the same time(ie a vnc and xnest sessions). Once OpenOffice was opened and started from oneof the sessions, any attempts from the other session would result in the OOoapplication starting up in the first session. However, I did notice the samebehavior using the upstream OOo 2.3(OOo_2.3.0_LinuxIntel_install_wJRE_en-US.tar.gz) downloaded from here:So I do not believe this is an issue behavior that was introduced in this CWS.While reading the previous comments in this issue, I realized that I may nothave tested all of the command line or headless test environments for this CWS.I'm not exactly sure what other scenarios the upstream developers believe willbreak with this CWS. Besides having kendy look into the printing failure, couldone of the upstream developers help explain to me what other tests should beexercise if any before we nominate this CWS?I will take a look at the patch this week. Thanks for the work.hro: Great, thanks!In the meantime, the behavior of the OSL pipe has changed a bit [see my confusion in;-)]. Will it help you if I resync the CWS & apply there the patch that adapts it to the new behavior?Just in case hro / kendy are still working on this, it might be worth looking atfixing up / handling splash bitmaps as per Kendy's suggestion earlier. This willaffect(and I imagine the new artwork that will be generated for3.0). Cheers.Interestingly, this was proposed as a GSoC task:hro: Our patches are still in ooo-build, it makes no sense to resync them again and again. Please have a look atAll these patches have to be applied; the first one implements the functionality, the second fixes it according to the changes in the OSL protocol, the third one fixes an endless loop in case OOo crashes on startup.I'll be happy to fix concerns, explain stuff, etc.Reopening, because the CWS got terribly outdated in the meantime.reset target because 2.4 is already released.sb: Please, could you help me with code review of this? It is quite tightly coupled with the OSL_PIPE (and I see you had to change the protocol a bit again), so it would be really great to have all this up-stream.If yes - should I create a patch that contains all the unxsplash-related work for you?@kendy: yes, I can look at it, but probably not before next week@kendy: finally found time to take a look at this (sorry for the delay), but allthreelinks from #desc66 just give 404; could you please"create a patch that contains all the unxsplash-related work"Here's my workaroundAs root rename oosplash.bin (on my machine it is in in /usr/lib/ooo-2.3/program)to oosplash.bin.orgCreate a new oosplash.bin script at the same directory with the below content#!/bin/bashCNT=`ps aux | grep oosplash | grep -v grep | wc -l`# expect exactly two lines lines (CNT = 2):# this process, and the sub-shell (CNT=`...` command)if [ "${CNT}" = "2" ]; then$(dirname $0)/oosplash.bin.org "$@"fiThis script allows oospalsh.bin.org to run only after any running oosplashterminates.Ugly hack, but works for me+me ..I'm adding this comment to all open issues with Issue Type == PATCH.

id=61816	The selected font color on the toolbar does not apply to the inputting text.This causes some confusion when a user wants to change the color while inputtingtext.I understand that function of the button is only to change the color of existingtext, but then we need to have more intuitive way to handle the scenario.Steps to reproduce,1. Open writer2. Type some text3. Select red color through the button on the toolbar4. Type more text5. Confirm the selected color does not apply to the text6. Change the font color to blue through 'Format > Character > Font Effects'.7. Type more text8. Confirm the selected color applies to the new text9. Now, font color button has red underline but inputting text has blue color. Reassigned to requirements.Note that the cursor changes to (in German) 'Gießkanne' when you use the button on the toolbar. The behaviour of this button has been changed. It works only when you use it over typed text. You can replace this button, called 'char colour' (German: Zeichenfarbe) with the button 'font colour' (German: Schriftfarbe). Then you have the same behaviour as 'Format > Character > Font Effects'. Strangly both buttons have the same icons and there is although a button without icon called in German 'Schriftfarbe Gießkanne' which has the same effect as the button 'font colour'.The button 'char background' has the similar behaviour as the button 'char colour' but there is no equivalent as for 'font colour'. And there is although a button without icon called in German 'Zeichenhintergrund Gießkanne' with the same effect as 'char background'This should be checked and changed.May be, that the English terms aren't correct. I have only a German version of OOo.OOo 680m155 (Build:9003)Hi jolatt,Thanks for the information. The 'Character' button seems to be the shortest wayto change the color of current position, for now.jeongkyu***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***completed summary in accordance to comments.The current UI behaviour is as reported, but:I doubt whether the current behaviour really should be changed - has that reallybeen discussed wirh "user experience"? Of course it is user friendly if theshown colour in the buttons matches with the colours of the text at the currentcaret position. But the current behaviour also has some advantage: The coloursin the button show the last action done with the button, and the next click onthe button will just redo this action. This behaviour would be lost if UI wouldbe changed as requested.

id=60946	If a footnote appears near the end of the page and there is insufficient space for the footnote on that page, the footnote moves to the next page, while the footnote's anchor remains on the same page.The requirement is that footnotes should always appear on the same page as their anchor, even if this results in a large area of white space at the bottom of a page.Where the footnote paragraph style is not set to "Do not split paragraph" at least one line should be kept with the footnote anchor. If Widow/Orphan protection is enabled, then two lines should be kept with the footnote anchor.Special case to consider: Where two or more notes appear in the same line or in the same protected paragraph as the last note, all of the notes should be moved to the next page if the last note does not fit. CreatedFootnote 3 separated from its reference numberPesala, works fine for me with OOO-dev m151 WinXP SP2.I'm closing this one for now. Feel free to reopen it if necessary (if you canreproduce with latest version), uploading the file.Thank you.HwoarangHi,I still can reproduce the error, I will attach a sample file. Tried with OO-dev151 Win32Intel on Win2000.MatthiasCreatedsample file - footnote 2 is on a seperate page than its anchorCan reproduce with OOo-dev m151 Win98SE -> Reopened.Pesala, thank you for the file.Hwoarangreproducible.The file was from me :-)The demonstrated error not only occurs if you have few big footnotes like in thesample file but also if you have many little notes with about 2 lines, but thisone is harder to reproduce.MatthiasMRU->FME: have a look at the attachment; there, footnote 2 is on page 1, whilethe footnote text is on next page. I think, this should not be.This bug causes another problem: If you enable "footnote numbering per page" anda footnote from the previous site "slipped" onto the current site (like infussnoteverrutscht.odt) you have two footnotes with the same number on one page...FME: Footnote 2 has the "do not split" attribute set. So there are two possibleways to resolve the situation: 1. The way OOo currently does2. Ignore the "do not split" attribute3. Move the "offending" footnote anchor to the next page, which can cause a lotof empty space on the current page.1. is also the way Word handles this situation. So for compatibility reasons, weshould keep our current behaviour. Btw., this only applies if there are morethan one footnote on the page.Therefore I set this one to "Invalid". You should consider filing a "request forenhancement" or a feature issue (including a feature specification would befine) if you like.closed.this is causing me troubles in ubuntu 6.06 OOo 2.0.2. This is not a featureenhancement, this is a bug. please reopen this bug and fix this. footnotes aresupposed to stay in the same page as the anchor is. it's very frustrating that this has been known for a while and not fixed.see (and vote for)I can still reproduce this problem with the newest OOo Writer (3.1.0) and itneeds to be reopened.Happened to me while writing a paper, very annoying, needs to be fixed.No idea why this was closed as invalid. It still affects the latest version. I don't care any more personally as I now use Serif™ PagePlus X5, which supports OpenType fonts.I think it is obvious that since the footnote is set to "do not split", and it won't all fit on the previous page, then it should be moved to the next page — together with its anchor. Who cares what Word does? They do not set the standards for all other applications.I just checked what PagePlus X5 does — it follows the second method — it ignores the "keep text together" attribute and W/O protection, keeping one line of two on the same page as the footnote anchor, and moves the other line of the footnote to the next page (text frame). If there are three lines in the footnote, it keeps two on the same page as the anchor and moves one, or keeps one and moves two. This is a better solution IMO, as it avoids the large white space problem.reproduced this in 3.3 Causes problems and needs to be fixed to avoid style issues. The footnote and anchor have to stay on the same page or at least keep a few lines of the footnote with the anchor to keep it together. Or move the entire footnote to the next page.Reproduced on Apache OpenOffice configuration 4.01 Rev. 1524958, Windows 7, by generating lorem ipsum paragraphs and using a considerably sizable footnotes.I replicated the original issue with footnote being on a different page than its anchor on Win7 and AOO Version 4.0.1.In addition, there is the possibility of a footnote being split onto two different pages. I will upload the .odt With footnote two being anchored on the first page, and starting on the first page, but the conclusion of the footnote is at the bottom of page 2.CreatedSplitFootnote.odtReplicated successfully on 4.0.1I replicated this issue of the footnote being on a different page than its anchor with version 4.0.1 on Windows 7 64-bit.

id=65198	Hi OOo wizardsI have just installed OOo2.0.2 and went to install some templates and clipart, but find that I am supposed to put them in a non-existent directory "~\OpenOffice 2.0\user\" with sub-directories of \template\, \gallery\, and \samples\.Surely this directory(s) should be created during installation if it is necessary to allow installtion of further components at a later date.Can I work around this by simply creating the directory(s) myself and placing the components in there?I look forward to your response (even if you're telling me to look at somer place in the OOo community where the issue has already been addressed - tried looking but was unable to track any resolution down.).CheersMalcolm Fletcher Btw, if I have sent this issue to the wrong forum/component/??, please draw it to the attention of the appropriate group. ThanksYou're talking about the directories in 'Application Data'? That's correct,these files are written at the first office start. It's not intended to writethese files at installation time.(Now I find the path to make additional comments ... Please ignore that email sent to "of@...")No. I am talking about the directories/files in "C:\Program Files\OpenOffice 2.0\..." where we are instructed to place unzipped files from the additional template/etc downloads (see). There is no "C:\Pr~Files\Open~2.0\user\" directory and I had already opened OOo so that if they were to be created when I first ran OOo they should have been there. CheersMalcolmIt looks like the documentation is not ok here. I think the shhare path is the right place for templates.I'll look over this and see what I can do about it. ThanksI have updated the following page:with the location needed in a 2.x install. Let me know if this is good enough,or if I need to do something else.Reopen this issue if you have a problem.ThanksScott, you forgot that Windows users need explict instructions. Unfortunatlywhat you provide is still insufficient. For example, only an administrator canstore templates into the directory you gave. Users, under most modern instancesof Windows, store in to something like C:\Documents andSettings\<username>\Applications where Applications itself may be hidden.Perhaps the whole page should be revamped.Hmm, mabye link it to a FAQ in the Wiki instead of poluting the page with alotof instructions?Something like:For install in Windows and a link.For Install in linux and a link.That be good?Hi kcarrI don't know that the issue has quite been grasped yet. While I have some experience with computers, I was left guessing at why I couldn't install the extras (clip-art, etc).If these directories are the destination of clip art, templates, etc. then surely the initial OOo installation process should create them automatically!? Or else the documentation for installing these add-ins needs to clearly describe the process that needs to be followed to create the directories, or possibly be automated in some kind of wizard that installs the add-ins when unzipped.If you are trying to create something that is able to be transparently used by the majority of users, it needs to be MUCH more 'hands-OFF' for them or they will find it too hard, and be tempted to stay with the 'devil they know' (MS Office -- UGH!)RegardsMalcolmBtw, my initial question of whether I can simply create these directories myself and then move the unzipped galleries into them has still not been answered (unless I have missed it or misunderstood earlier comments ...)Reset assignee on issues not touched by assignee in more than 1000 days.

id=65766	If you create a small document with a picture in it and add a caption to it, thepicture is embbeded into a frame. If you click on the frame the "Styles andFormatting" window shows, that the frame is based on the style "Frame" (but itis definitely not). If I now double click on "Frame" in "Styles and Formatting"all the distances I entered in the frame "style" are applicated. So the frameformat is not assigned properly to new frames.Styles and Formatting should really show the "Style and Formatting" of anobject. This means if a assign the style and formatting of a graphic to a frameit is correctly displayed as a graphic in the "Style and Formatting" window.So, if I add a caption frame to a picture there are in my opinion threepossibilities:- The frame gets the same style and formatting like the picture and is displayedas graphic- The frame gets the style and formatting of a frame and is displayed as a frame- The frame gets the style and formatting of an own style called "caption frame"and is displayed as a "caption frame" Reassigned to reqiurements.Same problem as.*** This issue has been marked as a duplicate of 17245 ***Closing dup.Reopened, pasted comments into wrong issue, sorry!Changed "issue type" from enhancement to defect.This is definetely a defect because the frame "style and formatting" isdisplayed but the "graphic" style and formatting is assigned.Ok, this problem still exists in OOo 3.0.When a caption is added to a picture, the frame receives the formatting of thepicture but this is not shown in the "styles and formatting" window.Additionally: The frame gets the actual format but not the "style andformatting". This means, that if you decide to change the "graphics" style andformatting, this is not applied to the caption-frames.I just want to add a description so that the influence of this issue is clear:1. When you create a big document you would normally use pictures with captions.2. So: You create a document. For every picture you add a frame by adding a caption.3. This frame seems to have the "style and formatting" frame (because this isshown in the window "style and formatting") but it has not. It has the sameformatting as the picture inside it. Problem: It has the same formatting but notthe same "style and formatting".4. So: You created a big document with many pictures and you decide that thereshould be some more space above the caption frames.5. You change the "style of formatting" of "frame". This does not changeanything since none of the caption frames is based on this (it is just displayedwrong.6. Since you know that the caption frames gets the same formatting as thepicture you try to change the "style and formatting" of "graphics". This doesnot help either, since the caption frame has the same formatting which thepicture had when you added the frame but not the "style and formatting".So: You have to assign a new style and formatting to each caption frame. This isvery bad.CCing myself and mba.I think that this bug should get a target.The "Style and Formatting" of frames is displayed wrong.

id=65779	One of OpenOffice.org's major shortcommings is that it still doesn't include anygood templates by default.With Word and WordPerfect users can just select a template and start working,without having to worry about layouting. In OOo this isn't possible yet.I made an effort to design a few simple templates. I tried to have them look asprofessional as possible. I also restricted myself to using only the BitstreamVera fonts as these are available on all the platforms OOo runs on, that way thetemplate looks exactly the same on all platforms.The template are called:- HumanistReport- HumanistCurriculumVitae- HumanistPresentation CreatedHumanist Report template for OOo WriterCreatedHumanist Curriculum Vitae template for OOo WriterCreatedHumanist Presentation template for OOo ImpressI hope you will consider these templates for inclusion into the default OOoinstall for all platforms.I'm willing to license them under any terms required by OOo, as long as mycontribution remains acknowledged.Yes these are welcome. They will be reviewed and released under the PDL licenseif the reviewer approves (not me). I have sent an invitation to you to join theproject.grsingleton: Please feel free to include these templates into OOo Premium.Actually they will go on the Extras iso and on to the DVD iso when I get itready. In the meantime, could you add a bit of explanation on your use ofHumanist, please. To me, the term has, shall we say, religious overtones from mytime supporting the local Humanist organization.Kami will pick them up it he likes them. That is what he did for the others.The Humanist word reflects on the used fonts:Vera is a Humanist sans-serif font.Thanks for that. I my opinion they are looking good. Scott will do the reviewfor us..Added me as CC.I will use it in OpenOffice.org Premium, and it will available in 2.0.3... Ihope I will have enough time to translate it into Hungarian...CreatedSpell checked and date formatted versionThe file I just attached is the c.v. template with some spelling corrections(use the spell checker next time!) and English date format. Please have itreviewed by a native speaker before inclusion.By the way, the template uses Bitstream Vera **Serif** here, not Sans Serif.Indeed, the templates generally use the Bitstream Vera family.But because Vera Serif is not much more than Vera Sans with Serifs added, it canbe considered Humanist too...Very nice set of templates. The only issue I had with them is the CurriculumVitae. It's a great template as well, just not too sure what Vitae means. ;-)Is this supposed to be a resume? If so can you change it to include the Authorsname in place of the Curriculum Vitae title?Indeed, it's a Resume:The author's name is already mentioned, in the document itself. So I'm not surewhat the best course of action would be. Mentioning the author twice seemsredundant.just a suggestion that the title be something like the following:CV for authoror ResumÃ© et cetera or simplyAuthorAll centred of course.and then delete the name line in the template. Doing so would be in keepingwith practice in NA. This is how I interpret Scott's comment. If CV styles are different in Europethan here in North America, it might be a good thing to have an A4 template foreach as well as a USletter template for each that uses the style appropriate tothe locale. What do you think?Well, that applicable to all these documents, though paper format is reallyeasily changed, so I would go with a single template.Doesn't OOo have somekind of capability (in a dialog or something), which askswhich papersize to use with the selected template, when a users creates a newdocument based on a template?It does but I discovered a gotcha when preparing the A4 version of the SETUPGUIDE, namely that A4 is narrower than USletter so margins need adjusting. Not alot but adjusted. Likewise on the length of the page, USletter being about 2cmshorter. Not a big deal for those of us who know but simple users get confused.No, wait! The margins do not need adjusting! I explicitly chose to have 3cmmargins, for the following reasons: - It's enough space to place your fingers while reading - It's handy space for teachers/mentors to make notes and commentsOn Letter sized paper, the content area should just be a little smaller.He, he. Smart and an excellent choice. You will see them in the templatessection sometime today or tomorrow. Merci.CreatedRedone Humanist Templates (for A4 and Letter), zipped together.CreatedRedone Humanist Templates (for A4 and Letter), zipped together. (v2)I just sent in a new set of templates (v2), because the report template stillhad sans-serif italic captions, which looked quite ugly...I changed them to fit in with the rest of the style to be serif-roman.Added to Samples and Templates repository. Many thanks. Please ensure you are amember of the documentation project. Your work may be of personal benefit orjust a bit of fun.CreatedNew renamed versions of my templates with a few minor fixes in the styles.Please avoid of using spaces and () characters in filenames :o)Are these for Windows only? Filenames with spaces may or may not work with otherOSes. Please let me know.Generally It should work on all plaftorm. But for example the building system(during the packing) refuse to use files with name contains sapces and ()... Soit is not problem but might cause problem...Thanks Kami. You taking these too?Hmm, well, my thoughts were like this:Because OpenOffice.org uses the filename as the template name to display withthe Template UI, I thought using Spaces en () would be better readable and somore user friendly.When you look at: 1. Humanist_Report_A4 2. Humanist Report (A4)The second is much more readable and less scary looking for new users.So I renamed the files because of this usability issue, but they can be renamedback though...File names should not have spaces in them. I have set the webpages up in such away as there should be no confusion. At least that is what I thoghtdid. So I am confused about the renaming of the files. No spaces in file namesshould satisfy even the most inexperienced windows user, don't you think. In anycase, when I review the new ones I will change the names to match the current set.You can fill the title of template (on the property page in the file menu) thisis the firs source of template name. If OOo can't find title then it usesfilename. So you should use filenames without space and () then you should addtitle for all templates. It makes the semi-professional templates moreprofessional :o)))CreatedRemoved the spaces and braces from the filenamesSorry I changed the versioning... But 0.4 seemed better suited than 4.0...The openoffice.org-humanist-templates_0.4-2.tar.gz tarball contains thetemplates, with the titles properly set, and I've changed Curriculum Vitae toResume. I also removed the spaces in the filenames.I have not reviewed as yet so this may be a dumb question but are the files allthat different from the first set or are the changes cosmetic in the sense offilename changes and names?As I have just listed the differences: - The template titles have been properly set (this is a change in the templateit self) - I have renamed the files to not contain any spaces anymore (filename change) - I have changed Curriculum Vitae to Resume (filename change)So the tarball should be used!Thanks, will review these and update the webpage as soon as possible.Added to OxyigenOffice ProfessionalReset assignee on issues not touched by assignee in more than 2000 days.
id=70333	As of 2.0.4rc3 the templates path has been restored (thanks!), but the'User-defined dictionaries' paths is still missing. ***has been confirmed by votes. ***One reason why these settings haven't been restored is that they are badlydesigned. The access to the wordbooks is not in any way different than theaccess to e.g. autotext files, but for whatever reason it uses two configurationentries instead of one. This should be cleaned up.Another point we have to fix is the access to the linguistic files. Our preferred way to install addiotional content would be to use packages butthe current code for dictionaries can't cope with this as it has fixed pathsettings.please keep me inform about backward compatibility as these may need DicOOoadjustmentsOf course, Laurent, thanks for the hint.This defect (not a feature) still persists in the 2.1.0 release (but oddly,never for me in the 2.0.4 release). I have a WinXP platform with en_CA locale.It's no big deal, except that I need to [re/de]select my dictionaries in Tools >Options > Paths > User-defined dictionaries each time I start-up OOo.added myself to CCThis issue will become superfluous with the implementation of(useof multi pathes).Closing..Please re-open as the issue has not been fixed.Reopening as requested.However, consider this note from tl:---For user-dictionaries this usually should also not be changed at theusers discretion because if a dictionary is editable or not is decided upon ifthe dictionary resides in the share or user layer of installation.However if you still feel there is the need to allow the user to add some pathsto the existing ones in the UI (without modifying or removing the defaultsettings!) you may write an issue that this should be allowed. ---[Note that we might want to get rid of the layers completely, so the problem outlined above could be mitigated by this]

id=72995	In Excel the rotation always acts in that way, that the vertical lines of thecolumn boxes remain vertical, so that the lines have no stairs. If you willachieve such vertical lines with the new chart it is difficult. If x- andy-angles are given, you need decimal z-angles, which are not possible. Analternative could be, to provide a button "align vertical" and use such anglesinternally. You will need it too, for correct importing of Excel charts. @IHA: Maybe a good idea.Thanks Regina. I see the problem with the vertical lines. But maybe we shouldchoose another solution and change the angle interpretation to what Excel does.I changed the summary to address the root problem.Isn't this issue solved now with the integration of the right-angled axesfeature - see. Or is there any need for further changes in thisdirection?I set this to duplicate ofnow.*** This issue has been marked as a duplicate of 67754 ***closed as duplicateNo it is not solved with right angles. I'll attach an Excel document with achart and a Calc document with the same data and a picture of the Excel chart.(Importing the Excel document doesn't help, because import of 3D charts is stillbroken.)Now try to make an OOo chart, that looks like Excel's chart. You cannot get itby entering the rotation value, although you can calculate them (see issue72994), because you cannot enter decimal values. Try to get it by dragging itwith the mouse in rotation mode. You will not be able to get vertical lineswithout steps, at least I couldn't it.Right angle is no option, because then the x-axis is horizontal.CreatedExcel document with 3D chartCreatedOOo document to try to get same chart as in ExcelCreatedBasic Library with Macro UprightChartCreatedDocument with 3D Column ChartI have uploaded a Basic Library containing the macro UpRightChart. Take a Columnchart in 3D view. Use the angles X=20Â°, y=30Â°, Z=10Â° for example, uncheckPerspective and uncheck "Right Angles". Try to get nice vertical lines for theboxes by entering a Z angle value or by rotating the diagram with the mouse.Now import the library, select the chart and execute the macro UpRightChart. Youwill notice the difference immediately.The macro is only for 3D Column charts and will not work correct for other charttypes.

id=73036	I'm sorry to get again a new issue like issue No. 5743. But I'm some kind newuser and encountered the described (below) feature just now.I'm using OOo 2.1 (german) on Win2000 - so I'm sorry if I don't mention the'right' (english) menue-spellings ;-)AutoInput is switched on, AutoCapitalization is switched off.1) create a new spreadsheet2) type xxxx in a cell3) move to the cell below that and try to enter Xxxx4) move to another fieldAfter leaving the cell I got 'xxxx' in this cell too.I got the point (solution?!), to switch off AutoInput, but this 'workaround'seems to be not real comfortable to me. I realize this behaviour on a newlyconverted sheet (from excel) with my password lists - real often there areentries like "kaschig" but even "Kaschig" - to switch the 'AutoInput' each timeis some kind nasty - remember it's a "global" option, effecting all open sheets.I really suggest to respect explicit choosen upper/lower letters. Confirming with OO 2.1 on WinXP - autoinput suggests string even if capitalization is different and, if user confirms by pressing enter, string is converted to unintended capitalization. Please see attached screenshot - to the left from arrow is what user typed, to the right - what user gets after pressing Enter./Tools/Cell Contents/AutoInput is used to provide strings used within the cellrange above to allow easier manual creation of lists. AutoInput is not availableif you enter a string outside a cell range. The behavior is intended by Calc.I understand Your intention (or that what You described as AutoInput-feature).But I cannot follow this.Problem is on my behalve, that the AutoInput-feature is only switchable onprogram-level. It even isn't switchable on column-level.Example: I have two spreadsheets open (not even an extensive usage, I think),one with my password-lists (often changes for some reasons...), the other onewith my business-account-statements (with a lot of recurrent lines of bookings).While I go to the password-column and the login-name-column I have to setAutoInput to off, changing to other columns in the first sheet, setting it to onagain, changing to the second sheet having it set to on. And additional havingset it to 'on' in the login-name-column is more usefull - because I really oftenuse names like 'kaschig' or 'Kaschig' e.g. (okay, the login-name is not changingas often as the password ;-))) ).Conclusion: the behaviour of the AutoInput-function is not optimal in all casesand I suggest to change it. Perhaps the problem is more offensive innot-english-languages (in my case: german) for more often having the firstletter of words/lists-entries possibly BOTH cases (lower AND upper).

So this Issue is a worksformeIssue if not an invalid one.Frankclosed wfmThe issue is still present in 2.2.1 (debian unstable).I consider it cannot be closed, because switching on/off the feature isinvisible to the normal user. Nobody could think of looking for such a option ina 3rd-level submenu!!!I personally lasted 1 year thinking it was a bug, and not a feature, because Iwas looking for something related in the options and couldn't find nothing.Please open the bug again.OpenOffice.org 3.01 still has the behavior described by Kaschig, and this shouldbe corrected.It is very annoying for the user, so please at least change the "Closed -worksforme" status of this issue to "enhancement".I'm sorry to disagree. I'm using OOo 3.0.1/300m15 (build 9379) even on Win2000SP4 (german) - it's great, I am able to enter "xxxxx" in row 1, switch with<enter> to row 2, enter "X" which is completed to "Xxxxx" and "x" in row 3 to"xxxxx". So it works on me! BTW: Thanks for the good work!(set Extras/Zellinhalte/AutoEingabe to true - which seems to be the default)So just keep it closed.It is curious: when I do what you told, I get "xxxxx" in every cell, with nocapitalization in the second row.I use the same version (000300m15 build 9379), but under Mac OS X 10.4 PPC andfrench localization. Maybe a platform-specific issue? I know that this issue hasthe "platform" field set to PC, but what should we do then, open a new issue orchange the platform in this one and reopen it?Okay, some more tests results in a curiosity... seems to be 'estimated'behaviour as desired by programmers for some reason, but I can't get the point...It works for me with most input. I DOESN'T work for me with some mathematicalsubjects: "minus", "plus", "wurzel", "pi", "gleich", "quadrat" (it's a Germanlanguage OOo!) - they're always kept in the case they were put the first timeinto that column. Regardless of the type of the cell (text, 'standard', date,value...)May somebody please explain that behaviour?Other 'words' work (like 'usa' <-> 'Usa' <urks>, 'Hilfe' <-> 'hilfe', 'work' <->'Work', 'Dadada' <-> 'dadada' in the same column).Greetings,Chrisremoved me from CC(In reply to)This is still happening with 3.3.0 Build:9567 Windows 7This is not an enhancement, this is a bug, and imho critical.

id=80374	It would be nice to be able to cancel an XComponentLoader.loadComponentFromURL()request, in the same way that e.g. XFrameLoader has a cancel() method for itsload() one.Related discussion on the api-dev mailing list My area .-)Only the asynchronous frame loader has this method and as loadComponentFromURLis a synchronous call it shouldn't use asynchronous frame loaders at all. IMHOasynchronous frame loaders should become deprecated.Anyway, it doesn't make sense to have a "cancel" in a synchronous method (as itcan't be canceled anymore when it returns).closingThe business case for this Feature Request is clear - if you read the relatedmailing list discussion that originated it.Some documents may take a long time to load, and in some scenarios it would bebetter to interrupt the loading operation and just return a message to the usersaying "Sorry, your document could not be loaded", rather than making him waitfor several minutes.If the current implementation of loadComponentFromURL cannot be interruptedbecause it's synchronous, then provide an asynchronous one that can be interrupted.In any case, I don't think that this request can be considered INVALID,different people have agreed that it would be a useful feature and 2 persons(not me) have voted for it.For this reason I am reopening it.as->mnasato: This task needs a lot or rework we cant do currently.

id=83548	<> describesthat solenv/bin/linkoo:1.16 is broken and cannot work reliably in general. Toavoid confusion, I would suggest removing it completely, including anyreferences to it from any documentation. Stefan - what are you smoking ? ;-)linkoo is a critical developer tool of incredible usefulness - and it has beenworking well for the last several years: and yes, it black-listed the 3-4libraries it did not work for in the past & all was well.I (for one) will not let it die, until something better replaces it (whichAFAICS it certainly has not).Kendy - any chance you can unwind this breakage ? :-)Sure - I'll try, I cannot live without it either.CreatedThis seems to fix that.The thing is that osl_getAbsoluteFileURL_impl_() is not the most cunning function under the sun - it seems to call realpath() on each and every piece of the path - apparently to be able to work even when the path does not exist. (I mean, to resolve /ugh/blah/haha.txt, it calls realpath() first on /ugh, then /ugh/blah, etc.) A side effect of realpath() is that it resolves symlinks, which I'm not sure is wanted in each and every case. So - from my point of view, I see several possible improvements here:- osl_getAbsoluteFileURL_impl_() could first try to call realpath(), and if, and only if, the file/directory does not exist, do the manual removal of '.' and '..'. It could even iterate from back to front so that the first non-failing realpath() would give us the path we want & the reason to end the iteration- osl_getAbsoluteFileURL_impl_() would not expand 'basename' symlink, just the symlinks that are in the 'dirname' part - that's in fact what my patch does when OOO_ALLOW_LINKOO_SYMLINKS is exported. I see no bad behavior with that so far - what risks are here, please?Of course - if the above is not viable, let's please at least apply the patch with the OOO_ALLOW_LINKOO_SYMLINKS distinction. Not being able to use linkoo is really painful.@kendy: I do not think it is a good idea to change the generalosl_getAbsoluteFileURL to work differently in different contexts---might open anice box of heisenbugs. IMO better would be to get consensus to changeosl_getAbsoluteFileURL so that it *always* does not follow symlinks in the finalpath segment (I put hro on cc). What also has to be taken care of is how tohandle paths whose last segment is "." or "..". (Apart from all that, if weindeed need an environment variable, please start its name with "SAL_" insteadof "OOO_", following prior art.)sb: OK, changed the name in ooo-build svn (will not attach the changed patch here).did not give me impression that there's a rule, so thought that OOO_ is a good prefix - sorry :-(hro: Please what do you think of the proposed changed not to follow symlinks in the final path segment?Apparently I forgot to play the re-assign ping-pong ;-)hro: Please, what do you think of the proposal not to follow symlinks in the final path segment?Along with the SAL_... environment variable it's O.K. for me.linkoo is not release relevant, change target to DevTools.Changing the target to 3.0 because the change that is necessary touches OOo code.sb: Seems that hro is OK with the environment variable... As this variable will be set only for the developers using linkoo [and they should know what they are doing ;-)] - OK for you to proceed, please? Or anything I can do to help to get this in?@kendy: I still consider my concerns from #desc6 valid. But if anybody elsedisagrees, so be it.sb: Yes, I'd rather go without the variable as well, and change the behavior as proposed (*always* does not follow symlinks in the final path segment), butdid not help here. From what I see, hro is OK with the variable, but says nothing about the proposal, so I'd go with the variable for now, and let the rest rot as a follow-up bug (something like 'SAL_ALLOW_LINKOO_SYMLINKS should go away') in IssueZilla. That's the best I can do from my side, sorry.***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***ping ! is target 3.0 still valid ?Probably not.seems not langer valid, closingclose issue.I beg to differ.@sb: any other avenue to make an installed office use solver/output tree libsdirecrly? if not, I'd definitely want this feature back.@thb: I thought kendy had made it work again as discussed in previous comments?sb: So, the proposal to change the behavior of the osl_getAbsoluteFileURL_impl_() generally caused huge problems IIRC, namely on MacOSX, so the only thing was really to use the variable.I am afraid I forgot to create a CWS for all this, let me fix that.

id=87337	This for example will not work:sub 0despite it makes sense. And I need to use it all the time in expressions like this one:P(AB mline sub 0)(again it does not work). Workaround -- insert empty object:P(AB mline "" sub 0)but it would be really useful to simply write what you mean. In latex you just type:P(AB|_2)and that's it -- no fake objects to make parser happy.Bottom line -- if user needs to use sup/sub tags, just let him/her do it, do not check if there is an reference object for it. Confirming with 2.4. I think the easier fix for this is to consider mline as avalid reference object. Please note that expressions likea divides^c_d ba nsupset^c_d ba equiv^c_d ba parallel^c_d ba divides^c_d bare allowed and so should be a mline^c_d b.CC for meMRU->TL: could be a useful change for the future. I think it should be allowedto use the "sub x" expression anywhere the user wants. There are some moresituations than just using as index.The problem with this is that the parser needs to decide where the subscript isplaced on way or the other.The two choice that immediately come two mind are left ( a over b _ 2 right ) newline left ( a over b "" _ 2 right ) newline And it becomes worse if the same idea is applied to left subscripts as (and itshould be for sake of common overall behavior) left ( a over b _ lsub right ) newline left ( a over b "" _ lsub right ) newline There is no way a mere parser can decide what the users intend was when writing it. Also such a change will be incompatible with existing documents that might havesuch constructs in use. You can't just have the formula left ( a over b right ) _2 newlinelook differently from one version to another. Currently the "2" is rendered at the bottom of the right brace where accordingto your proposal it should be rendered like left ( a over b right ) {}_2 newlineThus there would be import and export filter required as well.Maybe(!) it is possible to introduce some special rules to handle the casebetter but a simple rule with no exception is usually preferable to more morecomplex rules that have exception.Overall: No, this is not going to be changed.Especially not since there is a good concept that makes it clear to the parserand reader(!) which way the user wants the formula to be rendered. It is thevery same construct that can also be used in TeX. And that is already almost what you did. The expected way to do this is usingempty groups. E.g: P(AB |{}_0)Ooo:P(AB mline {} _0)Latex:P(AB|_0)The problem is -- you can make OOo as the latex competitor, or you can make every piece a bit more complex than latex (for reason unknown), but then latex will easily beat OOo.In this case it "just" 7 keystrokes less in favor of latex. And think about people with RSI or handicapped, for them it is not "just" 7 keystrokes, less or more. And this is just _one_ _simply_ equation.Latex parser can decide what object is on the left, so I guess it is technically possible.I am reopening this issue for reconsideration -- it is all if you want good theory of parsing, or great Ooo.I rephrase the wish maybe a bit -- do not insist that operators are not objects (case of sub and sup).PS. Sorry, missed the counting -- it is _8_ keystrokes difference. And the equation in latex takes 11 keystrokes (on my layout 9). So Ooo makes almost the double of it.

id=90476	I have long found that when I need to print something from the computer screen,the easiest way to do it was to hit PrintScreen, then paste it into an Excelspreadsheet, then crop and resize it till I have what I want.I just tried the same thing using OOo Calc 3.0Beta, and discovered that it ismuch more difficult. Calc brings up a window with measurements you can change,and its own snapshot of the graphic that shows where you are moving the bordersto. It works, but it is hard to get it just right. You cannot see it well, andmust often invoke the tool, change the measurements, and quit the tool severaltimes to get it just where you want it.PLEASE add a mouse tool that can be used directly on the image in thespreadsheet. The cropping icon could still bring up the window, and then abutton in that window could close the window and replace it with the mouse tool.Thanks,Tim(WinXP Home SP2, AMD Duron 950 processor)PS: Why does hitting the apostrophe while I_m typing (like just then!

After all, I'm not asking for anything that hasn't been in Microsoft Excel for more than 17 years. (If Excel could do it in 1997, surely Calc should be able to do it by 2014.)I frequently want to crop & overlay two Google Maps screenshots so they fit together. Or save an entire year of cropped screenshots of payroll tax confirmation screens on the same spreadsheet page. Excel is not a graphic editor either. Yet it's far easier to use it for the purposes I described than Word or Paint. By contrast, doing the same thing in OpenOffice Calc 3.x is torture. (I haven't used 4.x, but the comments here lead me to believe it hasn't changed.)I'll leave the status for appropriate project managers to correct. I sincerely hope that you will take another look at this and decide to reopen it.Thanks,Tim1. Calc is not an Excel clone.2. This request was in unconfirmed status for five and a half years.3. Bug author is not using AOO - see.I'm against this enhancement request.Let's see what others think.Hi timdeton,we could add this, but as a workaround you could just do what you want to do in draw/impress directly. You may also copy/paste your graphic to draw/impress (image editors), crop there and copy back. Or do the same with Drag&Drop. I see no urgent need to add the cropping tools to calc, but also no arguments against it.

If you are installing OOo on multiple PC's with MSO installed it is a pain manually configuring the file associations.Please give this back.This feature should be left the same as it was in 2.4.1, user choice. It was agreat surprise to me when I installed 3.0 and found out I had to redo all thefile associations manually. Your not improving the user experience at all!I agree that the previous step found in 2.4.1 was good. Although I do know howto associate file types, I prefer to use OpenOffice.org for the Microsoft filetypes. In the wishlist, it would be nice to have that choice returned.The association dialog no longer appears when running the 3.0 installer, givingthe distinct impression that the installer is buggy because I could find nomention that the dialog is now being skipped intentionally. This impression isonly reinforced by verifying that the dialog is still there in the installerdatabase (MSI).Please fix the installer database and restore the association dialog, or provideanother way to accomplish the association(s), because an important feature hasactually been removed.ThanksGiving users the option to change the MS file associations to point to OpenOffice is a must. I certainly know how to recreate a few associations, but formany of the clients and friends I work with who could gain from switching toOpen Office, a smooth transition is of paramount importance.I don't believe it needs to be in the setup wizard, but after the install, thereshould be some option to change the associations quickly and easily.As an example, I have one friend who has been using MS Office for years. Arecent malware problem caused her installed copy of MS Office to be corruptedincluding the registered file extensions (and of course she does not have theoriginal install CD's). After getting her computer cleaned, I suggested OpenOffice. After the install, her first comment was, "Why can't I double-click onmy files to open them anymore?" :) She was seriously considering running outto buy a new copy of MS Office right then. I guess what I'm trying to say isthat if we want people to switch, we have to make things as simple and clear aspossible, even the "small stuff" that may not seem all that important.I think it should present this dialog box, and it should ask users about Rich Text Format files.OpenOffice.org 3.0 leaves RTF files associatied with the rather inferior Wordpad by default, so I had to change the association and icon manually.This is super annoying to me. I don't have wordpad(junked it), and I justinstalled OpenOffice 3.0.0; it doesn't open RTF documents. :/I agree. It would be nice to have this restored in 3.0.1.I talking as an experienced user. Still I prefer the installation to be as simple and quick as possible, but I strongly oppose that OOo should change existing associations without asking. Therefore it should atomatically associate with ALL supported file types that currently have NO association.Then, if there is an existing association for either doc, xls, ppt or rtf, there should be a simple question:"Do you want OpenOffice.org to become your default application for all standard Microsoft Office documents and Rich Text Format (Wordpad) documents? If you choose "No", you can later change your preferred associations by {going to options/using the supplied tool/..?..}Yes or No."Please consider: it doesn't matter if MS Office is installed, because Microsoft offers free viewers for .doc, .xls and .ppt. Users may not want OOo to open MS Office documents, when they usually don't open them for editing, but for viewing only.Then we need a good UI for editing associations. Ideally it would display extension, description, current association and a checkbox for OOo association.One more:It is possible for any file type to have several associations (but of course only one default association), which all appear in the context menu. I'm not talking about the "Open with..." sub-menu, which is set by Windows when using the "Choose program..." option in this sub-menu.So even when the user chooses not to change default associations for MS Office documents, OOo can add itself to the options in the main context menu.I agree with wsky's comments. Don't force users to associate, but at least givethem the option to do it as part of the install. Making non-technical users manually associate MS files with their OpenOfficeequivalents is an absolute non-starter.I agree that the users should be able to decide whether they want to change the association at startup, but they should also have the ability to do it later.As I am deploying OpenOffice in my company, I would like to let the user use both products for a short period of time, and later change their associations when we remove MSOffice.Association step shouldn't be skipped! Moreover it should be part of Options and not installation to address situations when other apps "steal" back associations. Users clearly should be given possibility to decide whether to grab MS office file extension associations irregardless of whether MS Office was installed or not. In OOo 3.0 as opposed to prior OOo versions this is clearly broken. No matter whether I had MS Office installed or not double-clicking on .doc file won't open it in Writer unless I go through a convoluted MS process which for me even doesn't work on Vista.Btw, this issue is formulated is such a way that I'm at loss whether to vote for it or not provided everything I said above.IMHO an app should NEVER change file assocs without first asking the user.This is my first look at OOo and I specifically wanted to use OOo 3.0 to open MSOffice 2007 files on a laptop which did not have Office, but did have MS Works installed. Contrary to the info on the website, I did not get the option during installation to select which file types to associate and now everything is hooked into OOo. Not impressed. Will probably uninstall OOo and find some third-party redaers instead.I must agree that this change has not been a good one. Personally I am fine, butas a volunteer on the community forums I see a lot of first time (and existing)users complaining about this change (sometimes very angry indeed as if they feelcheated for trying out OOo). Just bring it back to where it was before v3.0.0,and if it ain't broke don't fix it...I found this reference:...which explains the rationale behind removing the association dialog. However,I disagree with the rationale that the dialog should be "removed from setup dueto users tend to check those options in setup and wonder why MSO registration isset to OOo." If users did this without reading the dialog, I would consider ituser error that can be repaired by using the "Repair" option with MSO or the MSOviewer tools.It is a hindrance to remove useful functionality without providing an alternative.In addition, the OOo 3.0 help file still refers to the dialog box under thetopic "Installation/Changing the Association of Microsoft Office Document Types".I vote again to restore the OOo 2.x functionality to allow the installer tocreate the file associations. The default state of the check boxes is adifferent question. Presumably if a file type does not have a registeredapplication, the default state could be selected; otherwise, it could be deselected.Thanks,BillAny well written program allows changing of the association of file types. Mybiggest gripe has been those programs that "steal" associations and make itdifficult to change back. I think this should be both in the install procedureand in the options. I am very much against this issue as stated ("Skip MS fileassociation".Is it possible to make clear what this issue is for? At the beginning, it wasfor skipping the MS file association dialog. Now that the dialog has beencompletely removed (not exactly what had been asked BTW), users use this reportto vote also for the come back of the file association dialog.To avoid any confusion, all users that want to have that dialog back shouldremove their votes from this one and vote forfiled few months ago.Possibility to set file associations is very neccesary for silent installation.I'm stuck on 2.4 Openoffice, because "SELECT_WORD=1/0" and "SELECT_EXCEL=1/0"aren't effective anymore.I vote against this issue and association dialog removal.Agreed,is a better placeto vote to get this fixed since it states the problem correctly.As far as I am concerned This is an emergency. I just had some people call me all excited because they suddenly could not open any documents after upgrading. What was wrong with it the way it was? regardless of whether or not MSoffice is installed it should be a choice on installation. The way issue 3 is now I have to go through alot of support work to get all possible office files associated with Openoffice. This violates so much commonsense that it blows my mind that it happened at all. Now I have people questioning whether or not OO is a viable alternative to Office. (sigh)All,If your vote is to restore the Microsoft Office file association dialog (notskip it, as the summary suggests), please vote forrather than this one.Regards,Bill
id=90841	Hi,I'm writing a book, and have long chapter titles. In the main content, Igenerally split them manually, with line breaks, so they are split where I wantthem to be (for proper esthetic control).PROBLEMS:1) When I insert the chapter name, as a field (for example, at the top of everypages), the line breaks are completely ignored, and the words before and afterthe original line breaks, are stuck together, with no space. I'd like OOo to adda space between these words (the standard XML-like behaviour).This is the most important enhancement in this report, as the only workaround,is not to use fields (or use a white on white header, without the line breaks-we can't use an hidden header, as it will not appear when inserting it as afield-, which is worse, semantically).2) When I generate the index, the line breaks are taken into account. However,as the index uses a smaller font, I'd like to get the chapter names on a singleline.Currently, as a workaround, I edit the index manually, to remove the line breaks.3) When I export my document as a PDF document, the generated PDF index, alsotake into account the line breaks. As with the index in the content, I'd like tobe able to get the chapter names on a single line.SOLUTION:In all these cases, by default, OOo should follow the original formatting, thatis, to take the line breaks into account (although this might lead tocompatibility problems, for fields -but as line breaks are currently removed,and soft hyphens are not displayed before line breaks (seeI justfilled), I guess few people use this).Then, in the Â«Text FlowÂ» tab of the paragraph styles, in the Â«BreaksÂ» section,there should be a new checkbox, titled: Â«Ignore the line breaksÂ».Its tooltip would be Â«Replaces line breaks with a space, or simply remove theline break, if preceeded by an optional hyphen.Â»(Soft hyphens should indeed be taken into account, so OOo does not add a space,inside a splitted word).In my case, I could then edit the paragraph style of Â«Contents 1Â», for thefirst-level chapter names, in my index, and Â«HeaderÂ», for page headers.For PDF documents, I guess there should be similar options, in the PDF exportingwindow...Thanks in advance to everyone who will work on this. Reassigned to SBAPlease attach example.No info from author.CreatedSample fileI'm attaching a sample file with a description of the problem. I'm also reopening the issue because it is still valid.

id=91868	Take the Dutch version of OO.o 3.0b2 (might be applicable to all translations, I don't know).1) Start Writer.2) In the statusbar the program tells that the language is set to Nederlands(NL).3) Type some characters in the empty document.4) In the statusbar the program tells that the language has switched to Engels (VS). OK, the program might be a bit stubborn, os let's set it back to Nederlands (NL).5) Type again some characters.6) Again the program switches the language to Engels (VS).You can repeat it several times and the program each time switches to Engels (VS).Try it in a document which is originally made in a Dutch version and even then the program changes it to Engels (VS). I checked it in the English-UI version and it is definitely a problem. Even after setting default language for document to Dutch, and after settinglanguage Dutch "for all text", new paragraphs become English (USA).It is also the case with other languages. This also happens when selecting all text in menu Edit, then setting thelanguage using the menu Format - Character. In OOo 1 and 2 this would result in new paragraphs getting the desired language.I think this is a disaster for any user who regularly writes in a differentlanguage than English (USA). Finding the right person to assign this to...Reassigning to Stefan.I suggest setting priority to P2, as this is a serious usability problem formany users.This is intended behavior. The input language follows the keyboard input locale.See:"language setting for typed text should be set to current input locale (keyboardsetting)"This behavior does not meet all users needs, therfore one might want to switchit off via UI:See:"Make Input language detection configurable"So I set this issue as duplicate to.*** This issue has been marked as a duplicate of 91552 ***Closing duplicate.I don't agree with it.Yes, i understand it is a duplicate of 91552, but that issue says if I interpret correctly that the keyboard layout takes preferences ALWAYS.I consider this an example of pure degraded user experience.Most computer users use a keyboard with an English layout (the so called QWERTY-keyboards).So letting the keyboard layout decide the language used by Oo.o is not that good, I suppose.I don't see why this is done.I want to point out in addition that I don't have problems with that keyboard layout dectection (even if it is probably wrong for most users since nearly everyone uses a keyboard with US layout).I've problems with the way it works:1) The program tries to make a proper choice.2) I, the user, am not satisfied and overrules the program by making the correct choice for my situation.3) The program detects immediately that it was overruled and changes the choice made by the user.So here we have the classical problem of "who's at the controls?"In my humble opinion it is "not done" that the program has the last right to decide. Even if the user is to make a wrong choice according to the programs standards, the programs last resort is to advise about it and it should never be able to persist in its own opinion.I suggest the following procedure:The program can make the detection only, I repeat only, at the first start after installation and if the user makes another choice the program has to respect that choice.I would furthermore suggest that the program makes the choice not on basis of the keyboard layout but based upon the language of the user interface of the program itself. The program can safely assume that the user understands the language of the user interface and that it will be very likely that the user will create most documents in that particular language.I've never seen any program so far that needed a reconfiguration of the computer system in order to work properly. If this "feature" remains active now or in the future I predict that a lot of users will switch to programs that work more intuitively, like Abiword for example.

id=93467	Pattern fields are pretty useful for quick data input: For instance, you canhave a time field in a table, and a pattern field, which displays an input mask"__:__", where you just need to enter the 4 numbers, *not* the colon (which cansignificantly speed up input if you have to enter a lot of data), and your inputwill automatically be converted to the proper time value.However, this holds only for "normal" pattern fields in a database form, itdoesn't work for table control pattern fields. In those fields, as soon as youstart entering the first number, the input mask completely vanishes. Inparticular, it means you need to type any fixed literals (such as the colon inthe time field example), where the sole justification for the existence ofpattern fields is exactly to *save* you from those extra characters.Attached is a document which demonstrates the problem: There are two patternfields in the form, a normal form control, and a grid column. In the former, youcan just start typing the 4 numbers to automatically be interpreted as time, inthe latter, you need to manually enter the "colon", which slows down data input. Createddocument to reproduce the bug caseehm - actually, the behavior is controller by the "Strict format" property ofthe control resp. column. Changing it to "Yes" for the grid column "fixes" theproblem.So, while this is not really a bug as described, I took the opportunity toconsolidate the initialization of newly created form controls / grid columns.Now, both will have the "Strict format" property set to "Yes" when newly created(formerly, this was the case for controls only, not for grid columns).Also, some other commonalities have been implemented. For instance, when youcreate a check box control in a database form, then it will automatically havethe "flat" style. For consistency reasons, this now is also true for check boxcolumns in table controls in database forms. And some more things like this,which were formerly done for the controls only, but not for grid columns ...fixed in CWS dba31cfs->msc: please verify in CWS dba31everified in CWS dba31efind more information about this CWS, like when it is available in the masterbuilds, in EIS, the Environment Information System:Checked w/ DEV310m_15 and OOO300m_51, Ubuntu 9.04In a grid column the setting is still defaulting NO using the test documentattached to this issue, also when creating a db, table and form from scratch inthese releasesReopeningUhm, cannot reproduce in DEV300.m51 (cannot test in m52 and later 'cause of):- open a new text document- insert a patter field from the "More Controls" toolbar=> it's "Strict format" property is set to "Yes"- insert a table control- insert a pattern column=> it's "Strict format" property is set to "Yes"fs->atjensen: What do you do differently?

The marker is moving discretely: 0.00cm, 0.25cm, 0.50cm, 0.75cm, 1.00cm etc.And compare it with OO Writer:. The marker is moving smoothly. So, for example, I can set indention to 0.1087123cm, 0.37743cm, 0.44387899cm, but it is difficult to set the marker exactly to 0.50 cm or to 1.00cm., unlike original description, is clear - thank you!You can also double-click anywhere on the horizontal ruler, and adjust the indents in the Paragraph dialog.Or create custom paragraph style with the desired discrete value.But it's inconvenient!OK - let's see what other people think.

I tried a few, but except the missing alignment, all otherattributes were preserved for me.I made the test again several times and lost everything.Then I added a few records in query "chrono_banks" and suddenly I got the sameresult as you: only the display status and the alignments are lost.Very strange! I'm now unable to reproduce what I noticed during dozens of tests!I also tested a recovery after shutting down the computer: same result.I'll wait and see... and report if it happens again.Thanks for your interest.Again I lost all number formats in the last four queries after a recovery!Every two days or so there occur a recovery of the file, and each time ALL thequery formats are completely lost.Okay, if you have a complete loss together with some crash/auto-recovery, thenplease cross-check with- it describes the problem that in 3.0, allchanges done to a file *before* a crash/recovery are lost from the original file*after* recovery.

If not, pleaseelaborate (step-by-step).The changes I lose are not always related to recovery; they have sometimes bedone several days before and the file has been open/saved after that. I have noproblem with data, only with format in queries.Hmm, but this description unfortunately does not allow to reproduce the problem,and thus not to fix it :(So, this issue here continues to describe the problem with the lost alignment ofchrono_banks.CC_Nouméa.Yes... I can only describe what I notice!If I work with the file, after a few days ALL the formats (not only thealignment, also the numerical format and the column's width) disappear from ALLthe queries.

Thanks.Repro:- open bug doc- open query chrono_banks- change the alignment of column "CC_Nouméa" to "Right"- close the query- save the DB doc- close the DB doc- re-open the DB doc- open the query, again=> the alignment is gone.targeting to 3.2, since the fix is part of a CWS aiming for this releaseIn the test file (not used for a about a week)The alignment is systematically lost in all queriesWhen I opened it the numeric formats were gone in the two first queries(chrono_banks & solde); I formated the columns again and now they are stillthere after several open/close.In my file (from which the test file was extracted) I notice the same behavior:- systematic lost of all alignments- systematic lost of the status of the right panel (document -> none)- periodic lost of formats in some queries (not always the same!)Please also note that each time I open a file "save" is proposed on exit, evenif no changes have been made.This bug here, as far as we could reproduce it, is fixed in CWS dba32a, which isnot yet integrated into the main trunk.

Should it be fixed in version 3.2.1 or will the fix appear in a next version?see above - we never could reproduce the complete bug you described, but only aproblem with a column alignment. This is the part which got fixed, and yes, itshould be fixed in 3.2.1. Other parts might still be there, but since we neversaw them ... :(If I refer my daily experience nothing has been fixed in version 3.2.1.I still loose regularly ALL formats in my queries, not only the alignments butalso the numeric formats.I can't understand that you are not able to reproduce it.

Are youinterested to get it... if the problem persists?definitely "yes"Just an idea before doing a new test: could the problem come from a corruptedprofile?unlikely, IMOI created a small test file (query_format_test.obd) with one table and fivequeries.

They were. But now they're not - see screen print in previous comment.I have also lost the formatting in queries from my own databases. I formattedthese yesterday after loading 3.2.1 and shut down overnight. They were OK thismorning but, having shut down and restarted again, they are unformatted again.thanks for providing the new documents. I'm buried deep within other work at themoment, so unless somebody from the QA teams looks into this, the issue has towait a few more days before I can spend time on it ...Phh. Okay, I see the .odb with e.g. query_x having a certain number format onthe last two columns, and I see the .odb where this format doesn't exist anymore.However, I do not know how to get from the one to the other, though I spent sometime playing with the query. That is, query_format_lost.odb is already broken,there's no way to "recover" the lost format from it. Consequently, we need toknow *how it happens* that a format is lost - I do not mean "how it happenstechnically", but what steps to do in the UI to provoke such a loss.Any chance you nail this down, so you can give a more specific description than"But after several tests (open, add/modify entries, save, close)"?()I played several times with the queries... without lost of format.I just noticed that the choice made for the display at the bottom right isn'tmemorized (another related bug?). I don't have that problem in my other DBs.Two days ago I reformatted the 20 queries in an other DB; today everything wasgone! Yesterday I just modified a few fields and closed it.After one more test with query_format_test.odb I just lost the format of thefour last queries after changing the alignment (left -> center) of the field"date" in the first query and saving/closing.I reopened, reformatted the 4 queries and save/closed. Then I reopened and madethe reverse change (center -> left) and saved/closed. When I reopened again theformat of the 2 last queries were gone. I reformatted them, saved/closed. Thirdchange of the alignment of the date, saved/closed. After reopening everythingwas correct! and now I can't reproduce the preceding behavior... No luck!I'm very sorry to not be able to be more precise. I can't find exactly whatcauses the lost; I just notice it. I'll continue to test and let you know if Ifind something which can be reproduced.I also tested "save & close" and found no difference when I save then close (with the red cross or using "quit" in the file menu or Ctrl+Q) or close and save after the warning windows poped up.Since a few days I lose again all or mostly queries' formats, even if I just doa check and close the DB.You should notice that I usually do my updates in the queries, but that mightnot be relevant because the lost occurs even if no updates have been made.Strangely the problem appears far most often in my bank DB (size 260 Kb) than inthe test DB (only 6.4 Kb).The only other difference that I have found between the two DBs is thememorization of the option for the content of the bottom right window: documentis memorized in the big DB but always reverts to none in the test DB (changingit and then Ctrl-Q don't produces the alert "the file has been modified" in thetest DB).I'm really tired to redo the same work again, again and again...After an upgrade to version 3.3 things are worse, but easy to reproduce.Now none query format is memorized; even the save button remains grayed afterchanges in a format, thus everything is lost as soon as the query window is closed.I formatted the fields in the table; these formats are displayed in the queries,but all other fields (for example sums) remain unformatted.

Why is "numberrecognition" turned "on" in tables and "off" in things that are not tables? Whatis the logic behind this? More importantly, where is this documented so that I,Joe User, knows why it is this way?I spent hours trying to figure out where in "Autocorrect" my version numberswere "automagically" translated to dates (1.1 --> 01/01/08 ?!?) until I finallyfound a "workaround" which happens to be unrelated to Autocorrect (hint: all"magic" automatic text conversion stuff should *be* in Autocorrect, logicallyspeaking). All numbers following the format X.Y where X < 13 are translated todates.To reproduce, create a blank table and insert in each cell successive dottednumbers.I should add that this issue still affects OpenOffice.org 3.1.0 (OOO310m11Build:9399).***has been confirmed by votes. ***this is not a problem of autocerrectionPlease look at "Tools -Options -> OpenOffice.org Writer - Tables"there you'll find "Number Reconition"Please look at "Tools -Options -> OpenOffice.org Writer - Tables"there you'll find "Number Reconition"--> yes, we found that; buy why is it "ON" by default? There is nowhere in thedocumentation that states "numbers entered in tables will be automagicallyconverted to dates, and you can turn this ''feature'' off by doing the above."When having a problem with text that changes by itself, the average user willgenerally suspect autocorrection. It is confusing that there are several placesto activate or desactivate "things that change text automatically".Indeed, the issue can be solved by turning off the "Tools / Options /OpenOffice.org Writer / Tables / Number Recognition" setting. The problems are:1. "Number recognition" does not seem associated with date recognition. Could benamed "Date and number recognition", or a separate option for dates could be added.2. Date recognition could be turned off by default. I spent a lot of timefighting with this problem. The most important thing is that date format changecannot be called "expected behavior": if I write "2009-09-18", I really mean Iwant it that way, and it is really frustrating to see it changed to "09/18/09".It's one thing to detect a number - e.g. entering 1.5 could, if some default wasset, be changed to 1.500 or whatever.Dates are a different issue completely. Entering the month's name and having itchanged to the short date format is completely infuriating. And undo doesn't have a separate step for this, so undoing it simply undoes thechange of format which is then redone as soon as you leave the cell. RUBBISH! For me, this is probably the most annoying thing about OO I meet on a daily basis.this is a question of support. discuss it ator thecorresponding mailinglist in your language-> closedIf you guys consider this a "support" issue, I will consider going back toMicrosoft Office.Cheers,mathieuI agree with maathieu, this is not a support issue.

If a section number is inserted in to a table it also is mangled intoan unknown format.The point is not that this behaviour may be turned of, but why it exists in thefirst place, and why it is enabled by default.You may believe that you are cleaning up unimportant issues by labelling them assupport, but it is the likes of ME who has to pick up the pieces of this shoddycoding.@marcsinclair: you are talking about bugs in this function (date not formattedin system locale) and propose as fix to switch it off: fix not accepted.If the function doesn't work *as it should*, file a (another) detailed issueabout this mentioning your system language and a step-by-step description ofwhat you do get and expect.We don't fix bugs by switching buggy functions off!Now to the meaning of this function: quickly type dates in tables "like" inCalc. (BTW: the AutoFormatting "March 09" -> "01.03.09" is the same as in Calc)Now to the default: we usually switch features we implement by default ON inorder them to be used.A good software should be yes so intuitive that it has no disturbing item and ifthen it should be obvious where to switch them ON/OFF.Yes it should but it's not always possible and what disturbs some people, someother like it...So now there are 3 possibilities:- You learn how to use this function- you know how switch it off and do so.- you report real bugs (meaning not "I don't like this function, switch itoff!") and enhancements.closed***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***I would like to add another feather of "seriously annoyed user"-weight to thisissue. I forget the exact details, but I suffered the "number recognition"curse as well. Personally, I find it ridiculous that Calc doesn't even TELL theuser what's happening. I would recommend that rather than turning it offcompletely, that instead a notification pop up the first time number recognitionis used by the program each session. Obviously, there are plenty ofalternatives, but leaving it simply turned on is likely to piss tons of peopleoff, and might cause a business or government entity evaluating the software tosimply drop it if they discover that the software is doing things they don'texpect it to do.I believe that some sort of compromise is possible between user experience andfeature-richness. I understand someone will undoubtedly have worked hard tomake the number recognition feature available, and I have no doubt that thereare people that find it useful. At the same time, it was nearly a show-stopperfor me when I had a project due soon for a class. If the bug (and I WILL callit that; were a programmer using an IDE that behaved in this way, changingintentionally-entered information without asking or notifying the programmer ofwhat was going on or where to turn the annoying behavior off, the programmerwould curse loudly and repeatedly and declare "the feature" to be a bug) cannearly devastate a simple student's experience with the software, then it wouldundoubtedly set any other large-scale users, such as a business or governmententity or university, into a serious tizzy. Large scale users might becomelarge-scale donors. Large-scale donors are your friend. "Features" that mightchase away large-scale donors should be modified such that they do not have sucha potential. This doesn't mean the feature should go away, or even that thefeature should be turned off by default. It simply means that the userexperience should be enriched with information telling the user why it is thattheir information is being changed, and how to stop it from happening.Beyond this, I have an opinion on how to handle such complaints in the future. Remember that as someone handling bugs for a large-scale product with manysimple end-users, you are often the first person related to the project thatusers with an issue will communicate with. If you come across as though you'resaying, "We're right, and we don't care about your problems, go away," or, "Ifyou don't know every little detail about the software, you're too stupid to beusing it," then you'll chase users away and pollute the community in general. Iunderstand that no one here actually said anything of that nature, but somemight construe certain posts as such. I also understand that it may sound likeI'm telling you how to do your job. To some extent, I suppose I am, but pleaseunderstand that I'm trying to be polite about it. I understand that you'rebusy, and have lots of bugs to triage and little time, and things that you'dlike to do with your life other than deal with whiny users. However, it greatlyenhances the user's experience when you show some level of sympathy to theirplight, such as noting that you've experienced such frustrations with othersoftware before and are willing to help the user fix the issue short-term (inthis instance, finding the checkbox to turn the behavior/feature off), and arealso willing to work with the user to look into long-term solutions and arewilling, at least a little, to investigate whether or not anything in theproject itself needs to be changed. In this case, when the user suggested thatthe feature be turned off by default, it would be far more diplomatic to say"Disabling the feature by default is an unacceptable solution. Would you bewilling to work with us to help find an alternative acceptable to users?"Also, immediately closing a bug makes it look like the entire team, or at leastthe specific responders, don't care about user frustrations at all.Remember, one of the purposes of Open-Source Software, as an idea, is to makeGOOD SOFTWARE. Good software doesn't just have good features that do coolthings, it has good features that do cool things when the user wants, how theuser wants. Good software doesn't just have the best algorithms, it has thebest user experience.Also, if this isn't the proper place to report such an issue, for example ifuser-experience issues are supposed to go to some other bug-tracker orsuggestion box, then don't just tell the bug-reporting user to go elsewhere(that sounds like you're telling them to four-letter-word off, by the way), tellthem exactly where they need to go (a link helps!) and give advice about theprocedure they need to follow.Anyway, sorry for the long post. I used to work retail, and based on what I'veseen having to handle customer service issues, the kind of behavior displayedhere would shortly result in cardboard signs with phrases like "Will work forfood" printed on them...This feature has cost me a lot of hours and i really don't see how this is evergoing to help anyone. If someone types in a certain data format it should stay like that. Point.The fancy thing you can do is to create the possibility to change it accordingto your wishes an thus add it to the cell formatting.Most obnoxious is that it is impossible to find what is causing this. it is nitin autocorrection. it is not a field and there is nothing about a date format inthe menu or the help.So please at least add this to the documentation and if the fancy stuff is notworking then switch it off by default because it is incomplete and undocumented.I agree with the points above. I was unable to disable this without resorting toa Google search (which turned up this closed bug). This must either be defaultdisabled or trigger a pop-up on the first table entry.I also spent several hours with this issue. Why was this marked as invalid? The "Number formatting" under tables is not a logical place to look for anyonehaving this issue with writer. Even if it's not a bug, it is unquestionably apoor design choice. I agree with others that when a feature is so aggressive asto get in the way of normal use (and this one absolutely does), it should bedisabled by default.Also, with calc values which aren't even supposed to be dates get magicallychanged into dates. This may be appropriate if the cell is marked as "Date", butotherwise calc would do better to leave it alone.***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***From reading this comments I seem to find that SOME of developers of OpenOfficeare arrogant or ignorant. Note that I'm sure MOST developers on this projectare not arrogant at all and are superb at what they do. So please don't getoffended if you are one of the good guys or gals.I want to get this point across though: software engineers don't necessarilymake good designers!!!! Some do sure... but a lot can't design! The reasonbeing if someone is ULTRA technical then they design for ultra technicalpeople... this is a fail!This is DEFINITELY a bug, not a software bug agreed, but it IS a design bug. For those that can't see this are just bad designers. Sorry if that's hard toswallow but that's a fact. I have noticed lot's of bug reports for OpenOfficewhere the whole 'Not a bug' comes in to play.The designers (not the engineers) need to start being a bit more honest aboutusability. Good design is easy, well at least for me.All user interfaces from microwaves, to cars, to MP3 players to mobile phonesshould be intuitive top most people for most functionality WITHOUT having toread the manual. If I have to read a manual to use a DVD fail it means thedesigners have failed... most DVD players ARE intuitive but some are badlydesigned (Yes I said badly DESIGNED).It worries me that people are so retarded at basic design skills. Of course myadvice will be ignored and people will keep being bad at what they do lol.Software engineers should stick to writing code NOT designing software (unlessthey happen to be skilled and TRAINED in design - YES you need to be trained todesign... to think otherwise is extremely arrogant or ignorant!) No offenceguys! If everyone knew their limits of expertise we'd be living in a muchbetter world. I DO have expertise on good design and it's a fact that thisissue is a design flaw. It is NOT up for debate in my book, it's a blatant fact.Here's the test. Ask 20 random users of OpenOffice (from a cross-section ofdifferent types of user) and ask them to reproduce this bug. Most people willfind it rather bizarre... this IS a design flaw.The phrase 'unusual behaviour' EQUALS 'bad design'. End of.I am starting to get really annoyed at poor design in this world... it's notthat hard come on!I invite you all to readand to actively contribute to the current subproject "Better Defaults".When the Wiki database will work again (we apparently have an outage), you willfind atthat this enhancement is already listed.***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***(In reply to)It certainly seems to be a duplicate, however I have since found that the bug doesn't exist in LibreOffice 3.3 running on SUSE11.4 but does exist in OpenOffice 3.3 running on Windows. Whether the bug is Windows dependent or whether a fix has been introdeuced by the LibreOffice crowd, I don't know yet.Also, the proposed fix is Not a fix. The propsal is to turn off the Writer / Tables / Number Recognition "feature". In Writer Version 3.3 there is no Writer / Tables / Number Recognition menu item. If the "feature" is reached by some means other than the menu, please explain how. As the proposed fix is not valid, the bug should not be marked closed.Another vote to please disable number recognition by default. This has bugged me quite frequently, and I never knew exactly what was going on until I had to work on this big table this past weekend, which contained many partial dates, was bugged dozens of times by the date changing at will; so I hit the internet and started searching for answers. It is completely unexpected behavior that OO will replace a date that I typed into a date that I didn't type. I very often use tables to keep things easily aligned & spaced out in headings etc. and I also often work on international documents; so I know a thing or two about keeping dates in check and sometimes needing to change the language settings. But, when I'm working on a local document and type 05/2002; OO should never change it to 05/01/02 nor change it into any other date format; as I did not specify the actual day for reason that it was either unknown or irrelevant. 05/01/02 could be Jan 2nd 2005 or May 1st 2002 or the 5th of Jan 2002.I just voted in favour of this issue. The number recognition assumes that anything in the format "#:##" is a time, and converts it to "##:##:##" (presumably hours:minutes:seconds). I have many times entered information that happens to LOOK like a time, but is, in fact, NOT a time. Converting "5:30" to "05:30:00" is just wrong. And, as has been pointed out several times, the option is not very well defined.I would also add that if I type in "5:30", and the program changes it to "05:30:00" and I go back and re-edit it to "5:30", the program should take that as a strong hint that I do NOT want it to change what I entered.Hello,This is issue is NOT minor,it is really MADDENING.I need to have the date in a certain wayand each time I am in Writer in a table the system keeps changing the date to a format that I don't want.Can you understand that users need to control what they do and not have the system control them ?I didn't remember why I had stopped using OOWriter and switched back to Word2010,now I know. I just can't work like that.I am in the process of using OOWriter again, but getting to the limit of my patience. Solving such issues is just showing respect to the users. User interface issues are by essence not minor.Thanks for listening,F. Fernandez, Geneva, SwitzerlandThis issue continues to rear its ugly little head in Ooo 4.1.1This is a design bug which has the potential to halt the penetration of Open Office in most organizations. I ask the programmers to take design issues like this seriously because little issues like this have a way of souring the user experience, and if that user happens to be someone who is making a decision about what their organization is going to use to edit documents, they are likely to choose to spend money on some software package to do the job rather than deal with noobs complaining about this bug repeatedly. Look at it this way, if there are people are using stupid little annoyances like this as an excuse for choosing to use something else rather than use the software you've been painstakingly working on for who knows how long, then you're basically wasting your time working on this software in the first place. Fixing this and similar design bugs will get more people using your software and make your time and effort more relevant.

id=103166	When I try to sort any spreadsheet it sorts by some unknown irrelevant factor.Example 1: Here is a budget spreadsheet prior to sorting:Here is the same spreadsheet after trying to sort by the date A to Z:Example 2: Here is a spreadsheet I created to track game data prior to sorting:Here is what it looks like after sorting A to Z:This problem did not exist in prior versions of Calc. Please provide a step by step scenario and a sample document which shows theproblem.CreatedOpen document spreadsheet with sorting failureI select a portion of a table Starting from the 'A' column over to the 'L' column and down a few rows to highlight the relevant data and click the sort button in the tool bar. None of the columns sort to any recognizable measure. With File: Hexazon, I select the entire table From "A" to "P" and click the sort button. There is no recognizable reason in the manner it sorts.CreatedBudget Calc file does not sort by date correctlyOK, please try the following : select the column range from L to A so that thecell that is selected before you click the sort button is in column A.The behavior of sort function has been changed with version 3.1 : now whensorting a set of columns, it is done by the column containing the current cell,even it is not the first column.And now, by default, the first cell in the column is used as label.Ah Ha! That works. I can see this possibly working better, because, as I recall, it used to be you could only sort by the left selected column before.Ok, closing. Thanks.Comment onBudget Calc file does not sort by date correctlyCalc sorts according to the string representation of the date - but this does not help in case of a date format DD.MM.YYYY(In reply to albrecht Faust from)Ooh, right. It should sort by the DateTime numerical value that is actually in the cell. That will always get it right unless the user does something very strange. This would depend on the cell actually being Numeric but formatted to present as a date or time-span. If any of the cells involved have text value, there's not much to be done, although sorting might help the user recognize what can be an easy mistake.I am reopening until we verify this aspect.I can't see any problem. The sort button sorts by the column where the cell cursor is in place.If the cell cursor is located in column A (select from L to A) it sorts the dates right. What is your result?CreatedThree date formats that sort in the same sequence(In reply to albrecht Faust from)I just checked this in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.1. In all cases, whatever the formatting used for the date, the columns are sorted by the chronological progression of the dates.Here are the ones I tried. I will check your exact use of DD.MM.YYYY to see if that makes any difference.(In reply to orcmid from)In the third column, I used the explicit format DD.MM.YYYY and it all worked, even after resorting the 5 rows.Please check for how your DD.MM.YYYY cells are formatted as dates. I notice, on an en_US installation, if I enter 25.01.1939 without specifying that the cell is for a date format, the entry is treated as a text string (and left-justified in the cell).If I specify that format for the cells first, entries work just fine.So the problem some may experience is that DD.MM.YYYY in their locale is not automatically recognized as a date unless the cell format is specified first?

But then do not expect thatOpenOffice will ever be treated a good quality product, and users like me willbe discouraged to further report (and help) issues !!I already mentioned, that I even tried to apply formatting of different kind andthere wasn't any effect of that on the row no. 13 and below.I can confirm the effect, but it may not be a defect. It is caused on my systemby the English(US)language or locale setting. Anything greater than 12 in themonth slot is not recognized as a date. Therefore that data with a monthgreater than 12 is pasted as text. If one changes the locale to English(UK)(DD/MM/YY), the pasted data is correctly recognized as a date.TomWOOO310m11 & OOO2.4.1 on Vista SP2I would still consider it a defect, since OOO is incorrectly assuming it to be amonth in first place, than a date. If the locale is set to EN(US), it shouldn't be that one has to paste the datesalways in MM/DD/YYYY format.Secondly, even if OOO assumes that the date is in MM/DD/YYYY format, it shouldat least allow the formatting to be change when someone manually attempts tochange it. Even that isn't happening here.Third, if locale was to control that you put the date always in one particularformat, then how has MS Excel or Sun's Soffice got it right ? This problemdoesn't occur in soffice or MS Excel.I just created a Excel workbook that shows the same handling of the date,whether copy/paste or typed in.Will attached Excel file.TomW000310m11 on Vista SP2 and Excel 2003 on XP SP2.CreatedExcel 2003 sheet with Date ExampleI only testet it, with the german localisation.It may be a duplicate to.If it is, please send me a messageFor me it's not a defect. As far as I know, the formatting of the cell does notdecide whether a string that seems to be a date must be interpreted as a date.@viren297 : in which case do you encounter this problem ? When you copy/pastefrom the web ?I think you have a workaround : paste your text to a plain text document in atext editor, copy the result and paste it in your speadsheet. Now Calc open animport dialog which allows you to choose the date format of your data.I tested this procedure under Ubuntu with gedit as text editor.@tomwb: I have tested it in Excel 2007, and this problem does surface. If yourequire I can attach the sheet. And it doesn't occur in Soffice either.@wope: I am not sure ifand this, are one and the same.@jbfaure: I have tried all, i.e. writing into spreadsheet, copying from a texteditor, and pasting in html format etc. etc. All show the same results.As far as using a workaround is concerned, well, people need a work around, whenthere is an issue / defect / problem with the usual functioning of theapplication, which again confirms that this indeed is a defect.Also, as I said earlier, leave alone auto-formatting not sensing the date formatcorrectly, its also about manual formatting not working either !!Do you still prefer not to consider it a defect ? If so, please go ahead andmark it as "Not A Defect" and feel happy about it. But, I must say that, focusis more here on "closing" the issue than "resolving" it, and this way productsdon't improve.thanks.Viren
id=101970	I've been using OpenOffice Calc suite for preparing bulk of test data in order to use in my projects. I use RANDBETWEEN function to append random number with a text string, which means we will have different text combination. If I need new set of text, I just invoke Ctrl + Shift + F9 to regenerate all random numbers afresh. In such case, the save button will not be enabled, which seems random generation does not affect the document content changed flag (IsDirty flag). Hence, the save button remains grayed out. It is not at all a bug issue. I just wanted to inform you about it. Thanks for allowing me to post an issue. The state of the save icon has been discussed to death in, and therestill hasn't been a consensus. Maybe you can bring your insight into that issue.This is essentially a duplicate of.*** This issue has been marked as a duplicate of 5226 ***closing a dupe.is to enable the save icon, although the document is not changed.

id=100112	There was a bug report through Korean community forum that a utf-8 encoded textfile was displayed broken when opened in OO.o. I checked the file with binaryeditor and found that the file has no BOM, and it caused OO.o to apply systemencoding (in this case, MS949) instead of utf-8. As far as I know, BOM is notmandatory for utf-8 encoded text file, then OO.o should handle the case inbetter way.I understand that it is possible to force a specific encoding when user openstext file in OO.o. However, for plain users who do not have idea on encoding,that would be rather difficult thing.The possible solutions I can think of are1. Letting user choose encoding when file is opened. This was alreadyimplemented for the text file without extension, and it might be not bad toapply the same thing for the utf-8 encoded text file without BOM.2. Implementing auto detection of encoding like in firefox. CreatedA sample UTF-8 encoded text file which has no BOM@ sba: Please have a look.SBA: When choosing file format "Text (encoded)" in the file open dialog, thereis an ecoding selection dialog coming up. - In that one, choose "UTF-8"-> File opens fine.@sba: I already knew that it works fine when users explicitly choose the correctfilter. However, I'd like to address the default behavior for the text filewithout BOM in this issue.The points of this issue are- It is not mandatory to have BOM in utf-8 encoded text file.- If there is no BOM in utf-8 encoded text file, OO.o applies system encoding bydefault.- When system's encoding is not UTF-8 (which is the most cases for WindowsXP/Vista), the files are decoded incorrectly.I believe the best solution is to figure out the correct encoding from the data.However, if it is or technically hard or not feasible to implement then pleaseconsider a work around at least.For example, the default behavior for the 'text file without extension' isasking users to choose encoding. What about implementing the same thing for the'text file without BOM'? It is certainly better then just displaying brokencharacters.

If it was excatly the same error asdescribed at first occurance than I would suppose it was just a temporary outageof the eis service. If you got another error message for the last occurrencethan "web service unavailable" please describe the error message. Errors likethe SOAP method is throwning an exception because for example an argument is notbeing accepted or if there is a null pointer access or if the SOAP service isnot correctly deployed should result in a different error message than "webservice unavailable."@bei: The error output was exactly the same (except for the cws name) as in desc1.occured for annother user to reopeningWhich was me.

IMO it's wrong to do it. As you can seeusing a clipboard view the documents provided by Writer have the default font set. What worries me more is that a CJK font setting is never applied in Draw orCalc. That's probably a problem of the EditEngine. This might also apply tocomplex font settings.After a second view I couldn't see the problem anymore in m69. Set resolution to Worksformeworksforme -> closedOS,Now, I can still reproduce this issue in DEV300m71 on Windows XP.But there is a little difference, in Draw or Calc the default font is "Lucia Sans Unicode", but not "Arial Unicode MS".IMO, maybe it is the real reason that different module has different default font set for a clipboard view.I don't agree this view. Because, CJK font set can be applied in Draw or Calc, except paste from writer document.set os as Windows XP.CreatedWriter doc for reproducingCreatedAfter pasting to Calc documentAdding OS to cc.

In Depot_Consor datais sorted in A2:A29, in Depot_Sparka data is sorted in A2:A33, both followed byempty cells included in the search range.

id=108303	supposed you import a DBF as new to an ODB-file and refuse to build the primkeyon import, it is lateron impossibe to set the primary key.adding a field as integer will worksetting this to primkey will fail, as a smart process to set the primary key isbroken.should work - so a Stopper Martin Createdmessage to the non functioning process***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***Yes it fails - as it should.If you add a column of type INT and then table is empty then you can set it tothe primary key.If the table has existing records then this new field will have all NULL valuesin it for every current record. The primary key designation requires that thefield be REQUIRED and NOT NULL.Add data to the column for existing records (unique values of course) and thenthe change to primary key will work.Setting the new field type to AUTO_VALUE will not help you here either, as thisonly fires when a NEW record is inserted. For help with the steps required to perform the AUTO_VALUE field addition pleaseask on the dba users mailing list or at the user.services forumSetting issue to INVALIDinvalid -> closedWell Drew, I guess you already know, that something has broken from the RC2,whereto this issue was mailed, to the actual RC5 or 3.2. final.Adding primary key is broken aswell as copying DBF-files to a ODB.Note: in principle you are absolutly right about the solution for how-to add aprimary key. But since it is impossible to add a primary key to a base-table manually or seta given field as primary key overruling to assistent, this is - in all versionsof base - a glitch. So actually the only way to import DBF-File is, to use the assistent. But that is broken due to the label-import-issue.And by that the reuse of self-constructed auto-increment fields as primary keyis impossible due to to problems with the problems by move a field to the and,as the constraints are not functioning due to label-import-issue, except youmanually edit each fieldlabel (which is a lousy but the only way to import, asthe field-type-detection is not functioning to)However, in the result it is not possible to edit the settings for the primarykey in a sufficient manner.Re-opend, and I guess you will leave it open until some of the basic are solved,and until it is even possible to judge whether this issue is solved or not . Thanks.Martinnope didn't know any of that...Ok - I can import dBase files to an embedded database and include a PK whendoing so and have no problem with labels at all? Do you have an issue number onthat one.I can also add a Primary Key IF I add a new field.I can not change an existing field to a primary key, it seems.oh and one correction - adding an auto_increment integer field to an existingtable does indeed, fill all existing records with proper values. So you can doboth steps in the table editor without a problem.Again - I am using XP and OOo 3.2 Changed summary for PK problemConfirmed and assign to developerFinally the problem is that a drop primary key is issued without If EXISTS.However you can assign Primary Key to an existing table column using the SQL DDLin the SQL window.so given a table with an column id you can make that the PK withALTER TABLE "Table1" ADD PRIMARY KEY ("id" )Createdscreencapture with problems on label- and type-detectionCreatedscreencapture with problems on label- and type-detection@mhatheoo Please one problem per issue - as you can see it can be hard enoughkeeping up with just one at times :>)Just looked at the screen shots and I have more questions then answers.Would you mind if we move this to the mailing list for now and if need be I'llopen another issue for the labels - but I want to ask about how you are tryingto import that dBase table first. OK?this attachement shows my problem with importing DBF: as shown in CALC and as shown in Base-import-assistentall labels and fields needed manual fixingrgdsMartinP.S.:sorry for posting attachement doubleYes of course, one problem only.However, you need to get these info to see, that these problems are connected -somehow. Nevertheless it would be kind if open the "label-issue" as new.Idea: Bring data from DBase to OOO/HSQLthe way is:open DBF in CALC with codepage 437select all and paste it to an ODB-file.normal dialog starts, but the labels fieldproperty-detection failed.The result you can see, the assistent is not functioning. (and I just found, that in my manual label-edit I made such much mistakes, thatthe resulting table is useless)Martinsome additional words:SUPPOSED you have -- ONE.odb, using the dbase-driver (routed to the appropriate path) and a -- TWO.odb with ordinary HSQL-tables, the COPY-dialog will fail too:on ONE select table and copyon TWO pastethe diaolg will start, but BOTH procedures (NEW with data or APPEND) will failwith exception:SQL-Status: 37000Fehler-Code: -16Wrong data type: java.lang.NumberFormatExceptionmartinwell - then we need to find out why your system is failing on this - because Ican import using the two ODB file solution (one of type dBase and the other HSQL)without problem.

id=108787	In Writer, for OOo 3.1.0 build 9399, on OpenBSD 4.6, one can 'right-click' withthe mouse on a paragraph and see an editing menu. At second from the top of themenu is the label 'Font' which brings up a list of typefaces. For both clarityand to avoid confusion, this submenu of typefaces would be much better off withthe label 'typefaces' rather than 'fonts' This problem is not available in the official build of OOo. Please refer to thedistributor of the OpenBSD build of OOo.Closed.mru, the OS was *not* FreeBSD, but OpenBSD. The error, if you have OOo on yoursystem can be verified. IF you need a different OS, then I can point out thatthe problem still exists on Mac OS X 10.5 with OpenOffice.org 3.1.1 OOO310m19(Build:9420)Again, the steps take 2 seconds to verify:1. open writer2. right click on a paragraphThere will be second from the top, the label 'font' which should read 'typeface'insteadYes, it is right, that the entry is "Font" - but why do you think that this isincorrect???When you put mouse on "Font" entry of the context menu, all available Fonts willbe listed, not the typefaces... and that is correct.Closed, the entry is and works correctly.mru: please leave this issue alone, since it is not a FreeBSD issue.The label 'font' very clearly goes to a list of typefaces on the severalversions of OOO on several operating systems, at least for the English-USversions.I do not know where you got you OOo build from, but I have checked now withdifferent Systems (Mac OSX, WinXP, Linux, Solaris) with en-US builds of OOo3.1.1 and 3.2rc4 and all show the second entry of the context menu "Font"heading to a list of available fonts, not any type face.Please attach a screenshot showing your problem.Are you sure, that you are using OOo downloaded from this site (or its mirrors)?CreatedTypefaces in menuOOo was downloaded from this page:See attached for screen shot showing list of typefaces under the label 'Font'.Ehm, yes... os where is the problem? On your screen shot I can see exactly whatI described. The "Font" entry heading to the fonts. The typefaces (and others)can be found under "Style" entry... Loke to be seen in Format.Character.Fontdialog tab.Yes, the context of style could be made more clear, too, but that's for adifferent bug. Take a look at the menu. You get it by using the right button (if you have notmade a left-handed mouse) while hovering over a paragraph in Writer. The menu you get has what's shown in the screen shot, a list of typesmislabelled as 'Font' : + default formatting - - - - -+ font [which shows typefaces]+ size+ style+ alignment+ line spacing - - - - -character...paragraph...page...Numbering/Bullets...Case/Characters... - - - - -Edit paragraph stylePlease change the English label to 'Typeface' from 'Font' in that second item onthe list.I know which menu you are talking about... but I do not see any reason to changethe string "Font" to "Typeface". You may be somehow right when talking abouttape and printing profession. But in word processors users are more used to thevocable "Font" when selecting a special font.Thus both most used word processors in the world use the word "Font" here. Andit won't be changed at all.Remember: it is word processing, not DTP.Closed, the word is correct in Word processors thus it won't be changed at all.@mru : please get out of the way. The excuse "Microsoft does it this way"doesn't cut it.Either 'type' or 'typeface' is fine.You did never name even ONE reasong or argument WHY to change this here.As I said, we are building a Word Processor, not a DTP. "Font" is more logic tothe majority of users than "typeface".I did not want to excuse it with Microsoft. But: by time, "Font" became anindustry standard not only defined by MS but also by early StarWriter, AmiPro,wordPerfect, Symphony and so on...Also, "get out of the way" is not a way of comminicating friendly with peoplegiving you software for free.We have defined this wording here for our product and it won't be changed atall. And of course this is not DEFECT.Closing duplicate.@mru : blocking for the sake of blocking is 'not very friendly' for thosedebugging the software as was the initial offhand dismissal of the defect. Copying others mistakes is not necessary. The term 'font' as it is used in themenu is incorrect confusing. I know of no obligation to copy or perpetuateincorrect menus.mru, I'm glad you brought up AmiPro and WordPerfect and that the misuse of theterm 'font' now comes from more correct use back then. While I have usedWordPerfect and even helped teach it a *very* long time ago, I never actuallylike the interface. AmiPro was quite nice from what I remember. Older WP'slike WordStar and Electric Pen didn't even mention 'font'I mention 'font' there, because back then it really was *font*. You could dosome modifications like bold, underline or strikethrough, but you were stuckwith the font on the daisywheel or selectric ball until it was physicallychanged. Some of the early laser printers had similar limitations, and actual*fonts* had to be loaded sometimes through physical cartridges. However, it's been ages and ages since those problems and most users even ifthey were around then have long since forgotten. Typefaces have been availableas a separate choice for a very long time and regardless of long or shorthistory, it is a list of typefaces that the menu in OOo is presenting the user.I am tired of discussing this stuff here. Do it with others and try to findothers following you. Maybe then you could find a way collecting enough votesfor this. This won't be changed just because YOU say its incorrect withoutgiving useful arguments.Note that this will not only affect the context menu but also Format.Characterdialog and Paragraph style dialog (both with "Font" tab). Also the word "Font"is used in other OpenOffice applications - not only Writer.Also note that you are not talking about the "Paragraph menu" - the menu thatyou open with right-click (or Ctrl-click on Mac) is called "context menu". Ifyou start a discussion and bashing about correctwording in a Word processor thendo it really correctly...Changing component to "Framework" as long as the word "Font" is used in all OOoapplications for the same meaning and context.Whatever it is called, it is not labeled and there are several ways to get toit. Hence the screen shot. However, the content of the menu is why this report has been filed, not otherparts of OOo.Sorry but MRU was perfectly right saying that "Font" is a common accepteddescription for what IS a typeface (aka "font family" in HTML).Please read:And especially: "However, the term font is also often used as a metonym fortypeface."So you are right to say those are typefaces, the problem is that this term isnot as well known as "Font".In the battle between technical exactitude and user-friendliness we chose thelast one on this matter.closedReopening: Please do not *ever* try to pass off a Wikipedia article as an authoritative source.The term "font" adversely affects user friendliness and it is incorrect. OpenOffice.org has not appeared in or out of a vacuum. It is one currentmanifestation of publishing tools in a long history of publishing nominallystarted with the Gutenberg press.

What now?(In reply to damjan from)OK, let's step back and look at this more deliberately. Regina may have information about what the ODF folks might be doing here. We should also check LibreOffice to see if there is a change there and what happens for down-level cases.
id=111061	Currently a detached tool bar is displaced relative to the document windowposition (when the document is loaded).If more than one spreadsheet document is open, and the focus is changed betweendocuments, the detached tool bar "bounces" around the screen, maintaining itsposition relative to the document currently in focus.This becomes very distracting if one consults several documents at the sametime, often hiding important information.If a detached tool bar were displayed absolutely (relative to the screen), itwould not move when one changes focus between spreadsheet documents.Thus the request for this option.Preferably the option would be accessible from inside the tool bar, via thedownward arrow.(A checkbox with a description something like "Absolute positioning of detachedtool bar" would be good.) Note that this is a very annoying problem, which really needs solution, despitetechnically being an enhancement.(It also wastes a lot of valuable time.)Note also that a number of issues have been filed relating to special cases ofthis problem. This issue proposes a general solution.Note also that this proposal is by toolbar. Each toolbar would continue to haveits own positioning.Also this could apply to any Opendocument type, not just spreadsheets.(Although my primary interest in this is spreadsheets.)---related enhancement 1 :Option for positioning relative to top/bottom, left/right, or centre.Could use code 0 for centre, 1 for top left, 2 for top right, 3 for bottomright, 4 for bottom left.Alternately, could use non-zero positive for left or top, negative for right orbottom, and 0,0 for centre.This would adresse in a general way a number of other requests for enhancements.---related enhancement 2 :option for positioning toolbar- globally : for all opendocument types- by type : for a specific Opendocument type, e.g. spreadsheet or text- by document : for a specific documentCancelling the configuration for a document (to use the type value), or theconfiguration for a type (to use the global value) would be useful.This would make it easy, for example, to configure all spreadsheets the same,with specific exceptions. (Very very useful in my case.)Of course this concept could be extended to other configuration parametres.Hello,Wrong component (changed to framework) and most probably a duplicate. Seem to besimilar toByeIt may be related to, but this issue asks for an enhancement,*adding an option* for absolute positioning of toolbars,while the other issue is asking to *replace* the current comportment.It is evident that many users are satisfied with the current comportment, (not aenormous flood of complaints), so only adding an option seems appropriate.(However, if the proposal of the other issue is changed to *adding an option* ...)By the way, if the component is supposed to be "framework" instead of"spreadsheet", it hasn't been changed.Note that the "entering and modifying issues" guide gives no info on this.Neither does a search of the site.it is already an old bug which appears also in 2.4 and maybe earlier.I think many users has filed it already under other names.when they adapt the toolbar or changed something in it.It happens under windows as well under Linux.I think that it would be a very useful enhancement.I don't find any duplicate reported.Your documents are not static and in some stage the absolute positioning will interfere.A flexible position per document is better.(In reply to Edwin Sharp from)Obviously you totally misunderstood the reason for this request.I WANT the detached tool bar to be in the same position for each open spreadsheet where-ever the particular spreadsheet window is located, to minimize the interference with other open windows.This bug should be reopened, as it was closed due to a misunderstanding.This bug needs to be reopened.It was closed as wontfix by someone who, from their comment, obviously did not understand the purpose of the enhancement request.No misunderstanding - the position can be set once for each window in the desired location.I'm against this request.(In reply to az77 from)I cannot confirm your description. I use AOO 4.0.1 on Windows 7. If I detach a toolbar and drag it to a position outside, it remains at that position independent of the document. It uses the last position I had chosen.Which version do you use?(In reply to Edwin Sharp from)Rather the absolute position of the particular tool bar would be set once for ALL windows, in the desired location.As an option, it would have no effect for users not interested in using the feature.Currently, the default position is relative to the window of the particular spreadsheet. So that when another spreadsheet is opened (in another location), the position of the tool bar is NOT the same.The fact that one can move it around after opening doesn't help. It is much more convenient if the tool bar uses the same fixed position, so there is no need to waste time and effort moving the tool bar each time a new spreadsheet is opened. With several spreadsheets open (for comparison), screen space is at a premium. There is a definite advantage to having several identical tool bars overwriting each other, thus wasting less space.(In reply to Regina Henschel from)Thanks for the feedback.I use 4.0 on Linux.Suppose you open one spreadsheet, and detach the tool bar.Then open a second spreadsheet. The window will open in a different location.Are you saying that the detached tool bar for the second spreadsheet will overwrite the first, at exactly the same location ? In my case, it uses the same relative location, so the second tool bar does not exactly overlay the first.If I use 3 spreadsheets simultaneously (for comparison), without moving the tool bar separately for each, I have 3 identical detached tool bars, in 3 different locations. (I frequently use at least 2 spreadsheets simultaneously, for different purposes.)I now see the difference. You open the file, detach the toolbar, and open the next file. I have detached the toolbar, closed the files and open them again. I then have got only one detached toolbar which stays where it is when switching the documents. I did it this way because of the remark "when the document is loaded".Binding position to document window is useful, when there is not enough space on the screen to put the toolbar besides the document, or when the toolbar is included in the document.The same discussion had been some time ago, see. I suggest to closeas duplicate of this one, although this is the newer one, because this issue has a suggestion to get both position options, and this issue has got votes.***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***
id=111251	Hi,I want to start all new chapters on a right (odd numbered) page. I understand this should be done by using a Righ Only page style at each new chapter.It would be much easier if a Page Break also allowed to specify the new page position. This could be included in the paragraph style, and automatically break the text and let it flow to the next right page each time the Chapter style is found.1) Edit the Chapter paragraph style.2) In Text Flow, specify there is a page break before, and that it is of the Next Right Page type.3) Apply the Chapter paragraph style to the first line of the new chapter.4) The new chapter begins in the next right page.This does not allow for different headings/footers, and a diffrerent page style in general, but changing page style is not always needed when starting a new chapter. However, this seems a much easier way of starting chapters on a defined page.

id=111952	gtk3 is coming. Mostly appears to be gtk2 with all deprecated apis removed.Attaching initial port to get started Createdgtk3 changeshanging onto this oneThis is really nice. I think we'll want to be able to build gtk-2.0 and gtk-3.0plugins in parallel. For once like the KDE3/4 conversion there will probably bea time of choice between the new/old Gnome version. And there are some oldplatforms to keep in mind where will still want to be able to built gtk-2.0support. So I'd like to suggest making this change so that we there are e.g.separate directories for gtk2/3 in vcl (and where else this later on matterslike fpicker) as well as have separate config options (like for KDE where thereis ENABLE_KDE and ENABLE_KDE4).It would be rather horrible to duplicate the dirs because as far as I can see sofar gtk3 isn't really different to gtk2 except that what used to be deprecatedis now totally gone and immediately after a dup they're going to fall out ofsync and cause misery. Though I take the point we would ideally want to be ableto build gtk2 and gtk3 versions side by side for a while. There is a (muchunloved) makefile.mk in sal which builds two versions of a .so from the samesource which might be an acceptable solution.What I'd like is to simply first get what version of gtk2 is the Hamburgbaseline ? We could simply replace any calls deprecated since that baseline withtheir modern equivalents, e.g. some are deprecated right from 2.0.1.What RelEng seems to use for building is gtk 2.4.1 (. As for the plugins goingout of sync: true, but part of that would be on purpose wouldn't it ? I guessgtk-3 will continue developing and the gtk3 will need/want to, too. I ceratinlyunderstand your point about duplication, but are you sure that that specialmakefile is going to be available when build-2.0 comes around (especially sinceyou say it's "unloved").committed to gtk3This was never merged.(In reply to)The CWS looks with more stuff than the patch attached here:

id=114187	When viewing the results of a query, any sort order created in the querydefinition is applied "invisibly" -- it does not show up in the sort orderdialog, you cannot remove it, and if you sort by any other column the new sortis added as a secondary sort (i.e., it often doesn't appear to do anything).The only sort that actually works as expected is if you reverse the originalsort. Otherwise, it just appears to a user that the sort function doesn't work.It doesn't matter whether the "order by" function was added through theOpenOffice query design or by direct SQL to the underlying database (embeddedHSQL in my case).The same problem does not exist with table views that contain "order by"statements -- you can sort the results normally when viewing data. Clarification:When viewing the results of a query that uses direct SQL (i.e., the "run SQLcommand directly" button is checked), neither sort *nor* filter commands work. This is true even if there is no "order by" clause or conditions on the query.Again, there is no feedback to the user that these options aren't available --you can press the buttons and fill in the dialog boxes, but nothing happens.This may be a separate issue from the above issue with "order by", but it seemsrelated.CreatedTest DB created when exploring this issue andExplanation of the test database:The same test database is relevant for(re-sorting sorted queries),(syntax errors in queries that reference a sorted query) and issue114189 (Base crashes when using filters on columns created by correlatedsubqueries).(A)There is one original table, named "Numbers". It consists of: "PrimaryKey", an auto-generated primary key, and "RandNumber", a series of random numbers 0 <= "RandNumber" < 1(B)There are three different versions of queries that operate directly on this table:"Query_OOSQL" runs through the OpenOffice SQL parser"Query_DirectSQL" has the "run SQL command directly" button selected"View" is a table view copy of Query_DirectSQLAll three create three columns: "ID", the primary key repeated, "MoreThanHalf", a boolean based on whether or not "RandNumber" is greater than0.5 (Side note -- I had to use some math and data type casting to recreate thisresult with the OpenOffice SQL parser, which doesn't accept a simple booleanstatement as a column definition. Annoying.) and "ThrownNum" which uses a correlated subquery to determine the rank of thisrecord when the records are sorted by primary key (i.e., counts the number ofrecords with a smaller or equal primary key).These are the queries that are relevant to-- arguably the mostimportant issue, since its the one that results in crashes (although probablyfewer people are using correlated subqueries than are sorting queries!)Applying a filter to the results of "Query_OOSQL" causes a crash. Applying afilter or sort to the results of "Query_DirectSQL" causes a crash or hang. Noproblems when using the view.(C)Then, there are a series of queries and one view named "HeadsOrTails" etc.,which basically regenerate the above results with different column alias, andvarious sort options. These are the queries that are relevant to (this) issue114187, about being unable to sort already sorted results.Note that sorting/filtering these queries doesn't cause crashing, even thoughthey are actually submitting a query with a subquery with a nested correlatedsubquery to the database. (The exception is the DirectSQL query, which ofcourse can't reference another query, and so is based on the "View" defined above.)"HeadsOrTails-HeadsSort" is a query ordered by the boolean column "Heads". Whenviewing the results, sorting by the count column "ThrowNum" adds a secondarysort. Filtering works properly."HeadsOrTails-ThrowSort" is a query ordered by the count column "ThrowNum". Trying to sort the results based on "Heads" appears to have no effect, since"ThrowNum" values are all unique. Again, filtering works properly."HeadsOrTails-NoSort" is the same query without an ordered by clause. It can besorted and filtered no problem."HeadsOrTails-NoSort-DirectSQL" is an unsorted query, but run directly by theembedded database instead of using the OpenOffice SQL parser. Results cannot besorted or filtered."View_HeadsOrTails" is a sorted table view. Data can be re-sorted and filteredno problem.(D)The final set of queries filter the HeadsOrTails queries to only list thosewhere "Heads" is true. These are the queries relevant to-- syntaxerrors when OpenOffice tries to use a sorted query as a subquery."HeadsOnly-UsingUnsortedQuery" is defined based on the "HeadsOrTails-NoSort"query. It works fine."HeadsOnly-UsingSortedQuery" is the same, but it is based on the"HeadsOrTails-HeadsSort" query. OpenOffice parses the query no problem, you canedit it in design mode, but when you actually try to view data the embeddeddatabase issues an error."HeadsOnly-UsingView" is again the same idea, but based on the (sorted)"View_HeadsOrTails". It works fine.All in all, a couple examples of unexpected behaviour and one dangerous crashwhen using queries. I think I'll be using mostly views from now on, but that'snot always an option when using an external database!Re-reading this sentence I realize it isn't very clear without actually openingthe database:"Then, there are a series of queries and one view named "HeadsOrTails" etc.,which basically regenerate the above results with different column alias, andvarious sort options."What I meant is that the "HeadsOrTails" queries are created in design view byselecting the columns from the first set of queries / views. "ThrowNum" isselected and "MoreThanHalf" is selected and aliased as "Heads". No functions or new subqueries are defined, although OpenOffice of coursecreates a nested sub-query by substituting one query into the FROM clause of theother. But that doesn't seem to cause problems.Confirmed w/ go-00 3.2.1 Windows and Linuxcite: When viewing the results of a query that uses direct SQL (i.e., the "run SQL command directly" button is checked), neither sort *nor* filter commands work. This is true even if there is no "order by" clause or conditions on the query. Again, there is no feedback to the user that these options aren't available -- you can press the buttons and fill in the dialog boxes, but nothing happens."Do you say that the filter/sort buttons are enabled when viewing the"*_DirectSQL" queries? Or are those two paragraphs unrelated?(Here, the buttons are disabled, which is the expected situation for a DirectSQL query.)So basically this issue boils down to:If you have a query containing an ORDER BY clause, say, SELECT * FROM <table> ORDER BY <column>, and display this query's data, then- the sort order dialog doesn't give you any clue that there already is a sort order applied- applying sort orders via the dialog might lead to confusing results, since the new explicit sort order is subordinate to the existing, implicit sort order, which the user might not know aboutI agree that this is a usability problem, though I am not sure how one wouldsolve this. Giving the user control over the existing implicit sort orders isnon-trivial, UX-wise, since then the "Remove Filter/Sort" button would needattention then (is this expected to remove only the implicit, or the implicitand the explicit sort orders?). Also, the sort order dialog would need anextension then, so it is not limited to three entries anymore (this would be aGood Thing (TM), anyway).quote: Do you say that the filter/sort buttons are enabled when viewing the"*_DirectSQL" queries? Or are those two paragraphs unrelated?As atjensen noted in a comment that unfortunately got appended to the wrongissue, the buttons are disabled if you run the query while in edit mode, but notif you just open the saved query. In that case, the buttons and dialogs can beused, they just don't have any effect. Although it would be ideal in the long wrong to enable sorts and filters onthese results, in the short term at least it would be expected to have thesebuttons disabled if they aren't going to do anything.Similarly, in the case of queries run through the OO SQL parser, I would suggestthat even if the user cannot *change* the original sort or filter stored in thequery, they should be able to at least have some feedback to know what is going on."in the long *term*" that should read. Not sure how Freud would interpret thatslip!As for the long term, my first instinct is that it shouldn't be too complicatedto implement it. Instead of sending a revised version of the original query(which OO wouldn't be able to do, since it isn't parsing the original query), OOcould create a new query that selected from the original as a subquery -- SELECT* FROM (original query) WHERE (new filter conditions) ORDER BY (new sort order). You wouldn't be able to remove existing filter conditions, only filter amongstthe results you have, but I think that is a reasonably intuitive behaviour.There's just one difficulty --, at least when dealing with theembedded DB.ah, I used the wrong version! In fact, in OOo 3.2.1, for both"HeadsOrTails-NoSort-DirectSQL" and "Query_DirectSQL", the filter/sort buttonsare enabled when opening the queries by double-clicking them.In OOo 3.3 Beta 1, this is fixed - so seems this issue is gone meanwhile.@ameliab: Could you please check if this work for you in OOo 3.3 RCx.

How shouldpeople packaging this then get the identical source code to what your versiongets from (I can remove all the DataAccess pieces myself, but...)As long as it's only somewhere else, it's not fixed *in the tree*. Reopen.(and before you say that it is not in the tree - if it should be do then youneed to update your docs on how to get the source code and build it.(I now assumedand)It is great that it installs, but does it work?I am not able to add /edit records using this driver either directly in a table or through a form.The add record icon in the record selector is disabled, and changing an existing record is just not possible.Note that using the jdbc driver I can edit/add records, our postgres server is running unchanged for over 2 years.Note, this problem occurs with OO 3.3 (from OO downloads on linux x32), LO 3.3 ( amd64, x32) and LO winxp.The driver 0.7.6a with OO 3.2.1 and LO 3.2.1 works fine.This is pretty bad because the alternative jdbc is pretty slow or even d*mned slow depending on the java version used (this is no exaggeration, I mean retrieving 10 records per second using SUN jre 1.6.24. Don't believe me? Try it!).Please, pretty please fix this, we do use this for serious stuff (billing).FerryReset assignee on issues not touched by assignee in more than 1000 days.

id=114430	I found a big bug in OOo Calc. The program does not calculate correctly: it'swell known that 0^0 doesn't exist, but OOo says that 0^0=1!!!To see the but, just put =0^0 in a cell.I've read this discuss, but since 2006 the bug is not fixed! OpenOffice.org implements OpenFormula. You should raise the issue there:The latest OpenFormula draftdoes the following:- in 6.4.6, it defines a^b as POWER(a,b) with the provision that a and bshouldn't both be zero.- but in 6.16.46, it allows both a and b to be zero, stating that POWER(0,0) is implementation-defined, but shall be one of 0,1, or an Error.So OOo respects the standard here, even though the result is clearlymathematically wrong. The way to initiate a change in the standard is describedin the links above.I can confirm this error at OOO330m7.OpenFormula draft says:6.4.6 Infix Operator "^"Summary: Exponentiation (Power).Syntax: Number Left ^ Number RightReturns: NumberConstraints: NOT(AND(Left=0; Right=0)); Evaluators may evaluate expressionswhere OR(Left != 0; Right != 0) evaluates to a non-Error value.So this may be a defect compared to OpenFormala definions but more importantthis is a big error compared to mathematics. There is no reason leave thisdefect as it is now even if there may be mathematically loose definitions forthe Power function in OpenFormula definitions. Still it allow implement thePower funtion too to give error message for Power(0;0). So only solution which is correct both mathematically and by OpenFormuladefinitions is change this ^ operator and the power function so that theyproduct error message for 0 ^ 0. There is not even compatibility reason forthis defect because for example gnumeric gives #Numero error in this situation.For 0^0, you can read this text in wikipedia:The ODF 1.2 standard says 0^0 shall be 0, 1 or an Error. The choice is implementation-defined.Since the the limit of x^x as x approaches 0 is 1, the choice used in Calc is reasonable for most spreadsheet uses.This is highly controversial: long ago, I contacted my HP calculator support about it and they gave an answer in Wikipedia lines.The limit of x^x when x -> 0 is indeterminate.The operation is no doubt illegal and the speadsheet should at least warn about it.We can give an error and still comply with OpenFormula.I will give such patch a try ... keep tuned.Technically, the proper response for calculation of 0^0 is NaN. I suspect there is a setting somewhere in the FPU to make it 1 though. I remember arguing with Don Knuth about this once (since he found 1 nicer for certain things). I once published (in Dr. Dobbs) a Pascal implementation of x^n for integer n. I solved the problem for 0^0 by returning 0/0, which is expected to be mathematically equivalent if neither is NaN. If the floating point implementation determined that to be NaN, good. If it was set up to return something else, I had managed to side-step imposing my own notion of the correct answer.This doesn't solve the problem for Calc of course. OpenFormula specifies (in 6.4.6) that 0^0 is not permitted. But it also says a^b is implemented by POWER(a,b). In 6.16.46 POWER(0,0) is implementation-defined but must be one of 0, 1, or an Error. The smart thing is to do whatever Excel does in this case. I just got #NUM! for =POWER(0,0) using Excel 2013 Preview. The thing about #NUM! is that it can't be overlooked, whereas a result of 0 or 1 can end up being used in further calculations without awareness of what is happening. Someone who doesn't like #NUM! (or the Calc equivalent) can add logic to produce the result they prefer instead if 0^0 is possible in their particular spreadsheet.Since Pedro is going to look into this, I am changing the status of this issue to REOPENED.This is actually a good chance to optimize yet another operation in AOO.We are currently using the system pow() version which relies on the same 0^0 behaviour but there are interesting implementations elsewhere:This is going to be fun.CreatedProof of concept patchI did a small wrapper around the pow() function.This is currently untested.Pedro, if no one actually tests this the patch is not going anywhere. It just joins the other 500 unintegrated patches, lost in the database.So I'll at least mark this as an "easy" fix in case a new developer feels like doing this.(In reply to)I own the issue and I will test it properly: I just thought that giventhat it is a controversial change I would let it up for review beforecommitting.Of course other testers are welcome.Setting as enhancement since, as multiple comments show including mine from 2010, this turns an ODF-compliant behavior into another ODF-compliant behavior, with a possible MS interoperability gain (or should it be marked as PATCH now? the online documentation is not clear).OK. Watch out. There are a lot of edge cases here, including raising negative numbers to non-integral powers. It is very easy to break existing spreadsheets in return for imperceptible performance increases.Of course, the good side of this is we'll have a nice test spreadsheet we can give to the QA team when this is done!(In reply to)Please note that I implemented this in a way that only the POWER() function is affected. Uses of the libc/C99 pow() function in other formulas is unaffected.What I did was actually add a powr() function to SAL. powr() is described in IEEE 754-2008 but has not been implemented in any libc, that I know of.CreatedTry to make it compile + cleanup.CreatedProof of concept - another iterationYet another try.Not guaranteed to compile yet: I keep making dumb mistakes.Sorry :(.CreatedTest fileThe test seems to work well, However I am noticing unrelated issues.0 ^ -2 = indeterminate1 ^ 10 = 1Bah ...(In reply to)This is due to the formula used by pow(). We are bug compatible with Excel here.Which is, of course, correct.Patch will be committed with some minor cosmetic fixes."pfg" committed SVNinto trunk:i114430 - AOO Calc: 0^0=1 and it should be indeterminate.I check again the IEEE 754 - 2008 documentation and the result offollows the standard, so I won't change that.(In reply to)That's because mathematically, 0^-2 = 1/(0^2) = 1/0. "indeterminate" is fine.The tricky case is (-3)^1.5 and any situation where the POWER(a,b) algorithm determines that exp(log(a)*b) is the calculation to use and it happens that a <= 0. OpenFormula leaves the case where a <=0 and b is not an integer to be implementation-defined. I notice Excel 2013 (Preview) produces #NUM! for POWER(-3,1.5). There should certainly be an error for Calc, whatever its particular code is.(In reply to)Yeah! .. I am forgetting my basic math :(.Nice catch!According to the standard we *should* return NaN (invalid operation).In my system it returns -3, but it is a system dependent bug:the wrapper uses the systems libc pow() and we are assuming C99- IEEE 754 compliance.I will add a check to fix it.Let's make sure these changes get into the release notes since this patch changes the calculations and results of existing OpenOffice spreadsheets. Users deserve to be warned that this may occur.(In reply to)+1. Fortunately, any changes in results are to ones that announce themselves rather than silently change the results of dependent calculations.Actually, there are very natural idioms in formula usage that will lead to silent errors due to this change. For example the =if(iserror()) pattern.(In reply to)Well, I wouldn't call that an idiom exactly if it means "I don't want to know about errors," like a try {whatever} catch(all) {nothing}.I agree about the release notes. For most folks, if the deviation is encountered, it is probably something that needs to be known about. Someone who has intentional if(iserror() ...) functions is likely going to know how to review and check those.(In reply to)You are making wide-sweeping and unreasonable assumptions here. Spreadsheets are not only used by their authors. Spreadsheets are distributed for others to use, embedded into applications, etc. So you cannot assume that changes like this are trivial to react to.I' seriously considering vetoing this change because it breaks backwards compatibility and does not come with a test case to prove that it even confirms to ODF 1.2.Pedro, I suggest that you bring this to the dev list. For an informed judgement we will need to examine:- ODF Formula conformance- Interoperability (especially with Microsoft Office)- Backwards compatibility- A proposed formulation for a sentence to put in the Release Notes for 4.0Hello;(In reply to)The change complies with both. I was even careful to mention IEEE 754 - 2008.4.0 is the best time for doing this change.When there is *somewhere* to add such note I will gladly do so.Now ...I am not spending my time on this, in fact I already unsubscribed from the -dev list to rest from confrontations with Rob.I think before reverting this (which *I* won't do):- A qualified mathematitian will have to explain why -0^-0 should be interpreted as 1 instead of NaN.- *specific* examples of functionality broken by this change must be provided.(In reply to)I can attest, as others already have, that the OpenFormula specification permits constrained implementation-defined values for POWER(0,0). The current implementation is admissible, although the definition of operation 0^0 is worded in a more-restrictive manner. Producing an Error value (e.g., #VALUE!) for POWER(0,0) is already permitted.Producing an Error value is what Microsoft Office Excel already does. I confirmed that with Excel 2013 (Preview) and I reported that here also. I am assuming that creating interoperability problems in this case is not in our best interests.It appears to me that the OpenFormula provision of "1" as an allowed implementation-defined result was a concession to some existing implementation. It is necessary for there to be an explicit definition of whatever the choice becomes in Calc documentation though. It is a conformance requirement. (I am somewhat astonished that the Chair of the ODF TC deflects this issue pending reconciliation with ODF 1.2 when this could be checked and confirmed by that expert directly.)There is no way to have both backward compatibility and interoperability. Someone concerned about the variability permitted by OpenFormula would be urged to construct formulas in a manner that these cases are successfully avoided or that an implementation-independent result is forced. That is something that would be helpful to provide in Calc documentation also. That is required beyond a release note on any change that is made.Moving forward, I think it would be a good idea to demonstrate exactly how the patched POWER(a,b) works for all of the cases covered in OpenFormula. I confirmed that the OpenOffice-lineage implementations and Excel already produce error values when a <=0 and b is not an integer, so there is no interoperability issue there. I am reopening this issue. I think it is fine to point out that this issue on both users@ OO.a.o and dev@ OO.a.o although I am not clear what question one wants to put before those lists.(In reply to)[ ... ]Rob has created a breaking changes topic on the AOO 4.0 Release Notes atI have added the proposed POWER(0,0) = #VALUE! change under that topic (far down the page).Here is the mathematical explanation. It is different than the Computer Scientist explanation. 1. Having a defined value. There are those who argue that POWER(0,0) should have a defined value because computer algorithms need those [although this is no longer true for common floating-point arithmetic, where there are defined undefined values such as NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity, etc]. The quasi-mathematical argument for 1 involves reasoning about limits of ratios (although there is no way for POWER(a,b) to determine that there are ratios and any convergent series involved. There is another argument based on the binomial theorem (one that Donald Knuth has told me he finds persuasive) although it is clear that Newton simply didn't consider the (a+b)^n case for a+b = 0 and n=0, it probably not being of any practical concern. But having x^0 always be one does simplify certain inductive/recursive definitions. I find the damage done to the axioms of arithmetic too perplexing. 2. Having an undefined value (i.e., making it an error, such as #VALUE!. There is no question that 0^0 is not defined in the standard model for real arithmetic. That is because division by 0 is already undefined in the standard model of arithmetic. These days computer arithmetics often have a distinct error value for divisions by 0, such as +infinity, but there is no pretense that this is an actual numeric result -- doing so requires a serious non-standard arithmetic. Some also recognize that 0/0 is different (since it is difficult to argue that the result is best expressed as an infinity), and the result NaN (Not a Number) is appropriate for this case.Why is that? Well, if one is going to give 0^0 a definite value, then it is expected that one preserves the law of exponents. If that is the case, it will follow that 0^0 = 0^(n-n) where n is not 0. But 0^(n-n) = 0^n/0^n = 0/0 and there we are.As I mentioned in an earlier comment, I once (Febuary 1986) published a PowerN(a,i) algorithm in Dr. Dobbs where I finessed this case by actually returning PowerN(0.0,0) as 0.0/0.0. I left it to the implementation of computer arithmetic to sort it out. (This was earlier than there are digital archives of Dr.Dobbs articles. I must scan this in someday. Fortunately, I retained the copyright.)CreatedAdditional testsHere are some more test cases, with a column indicating the values currently returned in AOO 3.4.1.CreatedA simpler patch.FP math in SAL is somewhat tricky and the additional conditions set by the standard IEEE 754 powr spec seem to be causing unwanted side effects.The attached patch simplifies the check to only do something in the 0⁰0 case.This still requires testing.A lost all interest in this issue given that:1) there is no consensus and2) people will go to extremes to get this patch reverted.The issue *is* valid though so I will leave it for some the communityat large to decide if it shall be classified as "Resolved - wont fix".CreatedProof of concept patchJust for curiosity sake ...I think the original patch was conceptually fine. The code for ScPow though,is not too clean and routinely raises values to the power of zero!The base implementation in sc probably requires some redesigning to be moreportable and it would not be suprising to find bugs.CreatedFinal patchThis solves all the issues.It doesn't go into cleaning the code in Sc though, that will likely require an orthogonal effort.Added "vetoed" keyword, to make it easier to track that status.For completeness (and historical record), the veto is about an earlier commit, with an early version of the patch, now removed from this issue.After the huge discussion on the dev list, it seems clear that the only way to MAYBE get consensus would be to merge Pedro's newer, final, patch and the existing behavior, making the value of 0 ^ 0 depend on a configuration option and keeping the existing behavior by default. See alsofor another use case that would benefit from the same configuration option.This assumes that a configuration option qualifies as an "implementation-defined behavior" per the ODF standard; but this should be checked as well before any further work on this issue.When I said I fixed all the issues, I meant I fixed ALL the issues.I think Rob is overreacting and should take the time to look at the patch before vetoing.Actually, I have a veto on changing the user-visible behavior of POWER() or the exponentiation operation via any patch associated with this issue.Of course, I may be persuaded by discussion on the dev list, including an explanation by Pedro on why he thinks a newer patch addresses the issues that led to the veto.But since a veto is outstanding on this issue, no patch should be committed.(In reply to)#1 Since we agreed to not revert vetoed patches quickly, then it makes sense to track the vetoes so they can be reverted when we get closer to a release.#2 Your patch has: #define SAL_STRICTER_MATHSo you are enabling the alternative behavior (non-backwards compatible) by default.(In reply to)I haven't agreed on anything. I think your act was brutal and against Apache policies and should be repaired.I am agnostic. I think some people may want the default behaviour while other want to be use the alternative option. With my patch people can decide during compile time.Ultimately I think it's the community that must take the decision (by voting) before the release. so feel free to submit the configure instrumentation and start a poll to see what should be the default behaviour.(In reply to)The only value of a configuration option is if it travels with the spreadsheet. Otherwise, we are simply creating an interoperability mess everywhere.There is an ODF-specific technique for including implementation-dependent settings in the <office:settings> element of a document. The implementation that an individual set of settings apply to is identified in the naming of each set. The only constraint on however the suggested configuration control be conveyed is this: "An ODF Consumer shall use application settings to alter application behavior only within the dimensions of variability permitted by this standard." We're clear that POWER(0,0) falls into that case.For this to be useful, it is good to make it known what the particular <config:config-item-set> definition is, and how it is identified, so that others could adopt it. (That is, make the provision implementation-defined.)There are probably other considerations that depend on how the ODF specifications are evolved, but use of <office:settings> should do for now. It is probably good to define the setting as applicable only to ODF 1.2 documents just in case.(In reply to)That could be an interesting approach, since you could toggle the configuration option automatically spreadsheets that originate from Excel. (In fact, maybe just make it be a "excel-compat-mode" flag, since that can be used to trigger a variety of adaptions.You mention one approach to do this in ODF.

But we would alsoI agree, having an excel-compat-mode in the settings would work fine. Having it set to that automatically on import of .xls and .xlsx would preserve the interop bidirectionally. If the document is saved as an .ods, there would be a discrepancy for for a compat-unaware consumer, but that is no different than getting it from .xls and .xslx directly. Also, Excel could signal compat-mode in the .ods files that software produces (at some point). If a new file is saved as .xsl[x], it is a little late. I suppose setting the default to produce .xls[x] would be a reason for setting excel-compat-mode though. There will be gray cases and now we're talking about a lot of interaction around this particular peculiarity.@Pedro - I see you are not in the CC: list.

For C++, I think the effort would be bearable. Our C++ ispretty standard :), and Novell (and now LO) uses doxygen for at least selectedmodules for years now.Sadly (well, in some sense), the IDL docu generated by autodoc has some morefeatures - the links to the dev guide spring to my mind, there might be more,Nikolai or Jürgen might be able to tell. I don't know enough 'bout doxygen toknow whether it supports plugins or something like that, allowing to implementthe same functionality there. I suppose it does, but ... we never came that farlast time we started the "doxygen vs. autodoc" discussion, since there was verystrong opposition against the idea of replacing the latter with the former.np->fs: Tested it with DEV300 m94, m96 and on CWS jsc340.

That IS a bug.If \u2060 doesn't joint the ' ' following it at all, it should not act in different ways depending on the space remaining within single line.I do understand that the ' ' is not a character but as you see \u2060 works as a "word joiner" until you diminish remaining space with given chars.

(png attached).OOo correctly sees the database as found in odbc.ini and allows me to save the .odb file and then deadlocks and leaks memory when it attempts to gain access.

I am more convinced today that this is a problem in only 64bit. Do you have the ability to install 64bit OS 11.2 to confirm? Here is what I found: I installed the unixODBC driver that ships with OS 11.2. The sqlodbc package that you found doesn't work correctly in 64bit. So I compiled it from source (version 0.89) and it compiles and installs cleanly. From the command line using isql I can query the database perfectly. Just to ensure that 32bit wasn't coming into play, I de-installed the 32bit sqlite drivers completely. This required removing a few other packages that are we are not using. I wondered if maybe OOo was finding these by accident. So I performed the same steps again, and it's still deadlocking when it tries to open the database, chews up memory continually. I had to kill it from the process list when it hit 10G of physical memory. If you can't replicate the conditions, I might have to build a 11.4 VM and try it on a newer version.Changes platform to x86_64.I have no 64bit test environment now, sorry I can not test more.getting rid of value "enhancement" for field "severity".For enhancement the field "issue type" shall be used.

id=118232	Version: 3.3 (latest official release)Operating System: Windows XP (SP3)Language of OO and OS: Chinese (complex, also known as traditional)1. Select Times New Roman.2. Type several letters or numbers.3. Set all: Format > Character > Superscript (default size).4. Set some: Format > Character > Emphasis > Dot > Above.PROBLEM: Those with a dot above is misaligned with those without.CAUSE: The "character with dot above" does not have the same heightas a plain character. As superscript, the superscripted characterwith a dot above, seems to be aligned (topwise) with "nonsuperscripted characterswith dot above", instead of with "superscripted characters withoutdot above".Thanks. Please also check for other emphasis styles.Thanks.Please check whether this is related to this one, aboutsuperscript and subscript positions:Thanks.As a workaround, whenever I have "emphasis dot above" in a superscript,I set the position (offset) to manual 26%, instead of the default 33%.getting rid of value "enhancement" for field "severity".For enhancement the field "issue type" shall be used.Assuming step 4 means Format - Character... - Font Effects - Overlining=Dotted, no misalignment is observed.Rev. 1513819 Win 7Please re-open this bug.You are looking at the wrong control.It is not "overline > dotted".It is a control somewhat below that.It should be called something like "accent" or "emphasis" or "highlight",and its value is "dot" and position is "above",and produce a dot over each letter.Selecting "below" does not have this alignment problem.Other options are "small circle", "big dot", etc.It seems that the superscript character is aligned topwise,which it should not. It should be aligned at a baseline,just as non-superscripted characters are.With Times New Roman and Chinese MingLiU （細明體）, my workaround is toset it at an offset of 26% instead of default 33%.With Japanese MS Mincho, my workaround is to set it at 32% instead of 33%.Also compare with:Thanks.Reopen per request in.

id=117730	Hello,the old print dialog (e.g. with OOo 3.2) had a very convenient feature: It was possible to choose and change the numbers of copies with the keyboard, all I did, was 1. Ctrl-P2. Cursor-UP multiple times to increase the number of copies3. hit ENTER to start printing.In a business environment, this was much faster than always using the mouse.Please port this behaviour to the new print dialog UI.regardsClaas reassignedOk, currently it is:1. Ctrl-P2. N3. Cursor-UP multiple times to increase the number of copies4. hit ENTER to start printing.But yes, it is definitely a valid enhancement.I don't think this is practical. Given that the print dialog always opens on the last visible tab page (which was an explicit design decision at the time of implementation of the new UI), the copy count field often is not even visible since another tab page is active.OTOH the change is small fries, so if UX decides we want the initial focus on the copy count field instead of the printer listbox on the general tab page, then so be it. Let's ask them.Currently the default focus is set to the 'Print' button which is also the default button in this dialog. Normally the focus is set to a control on the dialog area, most times on the first or the most frequently used one.Therefore I propose to set the default focus for the 'General' tab on the 'Number of copies' field, like in OOo 3.2. This was an intended change some years ago, because it is the most frequently used control in that dialog and users are used to it from competition. All other tabs should focus the first control by default.Most times the user will not use the additional tabs, so the 'General' tab would be the default one anyway.Whatever. Fixed in CWS vcl122; if the general tabpage comes up when the dialog pops up, the focus will be set to the copycount field.getting rid of value "enhancement" for field "severity".For enhancement the field "issue type" shall be used.below list is OK with build r1351567(build bot)1. Cursor-UP multiple times to increase the number of copies2. hit ENTER to start printing.(In reply to)This isn't fixed.

id=119733	Spreadsheet and Writer both crash a few seconds after loading (have not tried any other app). Sometimes I have enough time to open a spreadsheet. This happens every time I start the apps. I can start the spreadsheet or writer app and let it sit with a blank doc and after about 15-20 second the dialog box "Due to an unexpected error, Openoffice.org crashed..." appears. I tells me that the doc I'm working on will be saved and presents me with a "Close" button at the bottom of the dialogue. I click the close and this dialogue stops responding.. Have to force it closed via windows. Can anybody reproduce this?I had a similar problem myself and heard it from others. The reason had been a faulty file registrymodifications.xcu. I could not find out, why the file gets faulty.@David: Please search for this file in your OpenOffice user folder in your Windows profile and rename it. It will be regenerated with the next AOO start. Please report back, whether this solves your problem.Hey Regina. Your suggestion worked. I had the spreadsheet open for over an hour with no crashes.ThanksRemove the registrymodifications.xcu work here, suggest close this bug.Reopening. The bug was resolved for the user, but we didn't find a fix.I was using the version before 3.4 without problems. As soon as I upgraded to 3.4, I have been experiencing exactly the same crashes in both Calc and Writer as described in this thread.Could someone please clarify exactly what I should do to registrymodifications.xcu to cure the problem, assuming that this file is also the culprit in my case too.(In reply to)you have to close OpenOffice, including the quickstarter icon in the system tray, and then rename that file, so that it gets regenerated on the next start.Apologies for being obtuse, but where is the Windows profile folder to be found? I am running under XP.Also, does it matter how I rename the file? Should I leave the .xcu extension intact?(In reply to)On my Windows XP it is under:C:\Documents and Settings\ariel\Datos de programa\OpenOffice.org\3\userReplace "ariel" with your user name, and "Datos de programa" is in English "Program data". Please note that "C:\Documents and Settings\YourName\Program data" is a hidden folder in Win XP, so enter the path directly on the Explorer, or select the option to also display hidden files.You can rename it to registrymodifications.xcu.bak for example.If this does not work, try renaming the whole directory:C:\Documents and Settings\YourName\Program data\OpenOffice.org\3\user-oldThanks to your help, I was able to regenerate registrymodifications.xcu. Unfortunately, this hasn't cured the problem for me, but it was worth a try.Using version 3.4.0After opening the spreadsheet, I clicked on HELP and entered the search criterion "delete rows". As soon as I clicked FIND I got this error. My background is in mainframe programming, primarily in COBOL, with some assemblers added for flavor.If you need it, I can send you a copy of the spreadsheet, which in my case is the source data for a mailing list.I'd still like to know how to get rid of the rows that I no longer need (people who've died, moved with no forwarding address, have withdrawn from the organization, or no longer want to receive our mailings).I am experiencing the exact same symptoms. I have de-installed Open Office, totally removed c:\users\<myusername>\AppData\Roaming\OpenOffice.org, then reinstalled Open Office. Same problem appears within 30 seconds of opening a spreadsheet.I have found and deleted registrymodifications.xcu, only to have it reappear as the program crashes.By the way, Gnumeric Spreadsheet works without a problem, on the same spreadsheets that cause Open Office to crash.I should mention that Writer also crashes within seconds after opening, whether or not I am actively editing a document.Createdreport.wer file created by windowsThis is the report,wer file created by windows after the crash.When this happens to me, it is after a re-boot.

id=120304	CreatedAlignment In Math Matrix With OOo3.4 & OOo3.3The « alignr » math formula command is no more efficient since OOo 3.4 when used for aligning to the right the objects inside a column of a math matrix (a math matrix is a table with columns and rows).Look at the two pdf attachments : one has been compiled and exported with OOo 3.4, the other one with OOo 3.3.This bug arises only with the new version of OOo – so it is a « regression ».It is a « release_blocker » because I will get rid of OOo 3.4 and re-install OOo 3.3 (which is inoperant since I've intalled OOo 3.4). I've joined (hybrid) pdf formats to make sure you see the differences between those two versions.Luc P. The wrong alignment is caused by the minus sign. A plus sign produces the wrong alignment too. The alignment is wrong too for alignl. The error is only in a matrix, not in a stack.It seems, that the position is shifted one place to the left.Workaround: Add an empty text "" or an empty operand {} before the minus sign.CreatedDocument with one matrix with alignr and alignlThe alignment is OK in DEV300m93 (around 2010-11-15) and broken in DEV300m94 (around 2010-12-03).I surely prefer to use OpenOffice 3.3 and LibreOffice 3.3.4 instead of OO 3.4 or LO 3.5.5 when having to write matrices, which means quite often while teaching linear algebra.The syntax was then fairly easy and clear : writing the « alignr » command only once before the matrix command was enough.And also that simple with « alignc » and « alignl » if necessary.Now, with the new versions, would we have to write the alignment commands erratically with a lot of symbols (`,~," " ) to adjust spacing ? Doesn't it become "monstruous" and annoying ? I mean, this workaround is not a real solution : there IS a real bug over there.I observe regression occurs.I hope it will be corrected in the next version.It is an obstacle to convincing my math colleagues to quit Micro$oft for OO or LO.And using "old" versions is a risk on security, it seems.Incidently, the installation of OO 3.4 destroyed my "old" 3.3 version.After having lost hours of web researches, I finally found the OO 3.3 and the LO 3.4 versions.One at,the other atDon't forget to uninstall OO 3.4 before a clean re-install of OO 3.3.Here is the easy way I found to resolve this problem I pointed out 2 years ago.Inside the matrix code (in Math module), negative numbers should be written with the large minus sign « – », instead of the narrow one « - ».On an Apple mac keyboard, the large minus sign is obtained via simultaneous keys [alt][maj][+=], where [maj] stands for the (majuscule) capital letters key.The output in Text (out of Math module) is the same large minus sign, but the alignment (left, center, right) is now respected.Tested on LO 4.2.6.2 and OO 4.1.1 (running under Mavericks).This is not fixed. Using a minus as text is only a workaround for using a negative number. This workaround works the same as putting an empty string before the number.A "fix" needs a change in the core.

id=121086	When I upgraded from 3.3, I was no longer able to open a password protected spreadsheet -- it says "The password is incorrect. The file cannot be opened". I tried this on two machines running OS X 10.7 a while ago.When I upgraded to 10.8, I first erased the HD. AOO 3.4 was therefore a clean install. Again, I could not open the file. I installed OO3.3 and opened the file.In OO 3.3 I saved the file with another name without a password, then started AOO 3.4 and opened the file. I then did a Save As to save the file to a new filename with a password. I get an error "Error saving the document NEWFILE: General Error. General input/output error."I then created a new spreadsheet, filled in a single cell, and tried to save it with a password. I get the same error. I've run into this same problem on AOOo 3.4.1 on OS X (10.6.8).I have a Calc file created under a (much) older version of OOo (pre-Apache), probably in the 2.x series. I had no problems opening that file with AOOo prior to 3.3 (not sure about 3.3 itself, though), and can open it with every version of NeoOffice I've ever used. But it does not open in AOOo 3.4.1 -- when I type the (correct!) password, I get "The password is incorrect. The file cannot be opened."FWIW, this also affects LibreOffice 3.5.3.2, so the problem exists at least as far back as the version of the underlying codebase from which that version LO was forked.Since this seems to affect all password-protected documents, it seems like it should be a fairly high priority bug -- especially the only obvious workaround, at least for now, is to keep multiple versions around just to open those files.***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***Updated Component. Was listed as website 'www', and should be product 'code'.I am not able to verify this on Windows XP.I created 6 documents in OpenOffice 3.3.0: in the three ODF formats (odt, ods, odp) as well as the three Microsoft binary formats (doc, xls, ppt). All were saved with a password. I was able to open all of them in AOO 3.4.0 and AOO 3.4.1.The one bug I did see was that PPT files were saved without a password in OOo 3.3.0.But I wonder if there is a MacOS-specific bug with reading 3.3.0 password-protected documents?I will attach the test documents I used.

Are you saying that you received an error but the file then opened and showed you "Hello world" ???I cannot open or save files with passwords in 3.4, just as I posted in September 2012.As a result, I continue to use version 3.3. I opened your files in 3.3 with the password to confirm they opened, and read the text.I downloaded the v3.4.1 DMG file, and posted the error message I got when opening the file. As the message says, "The file cannot be opened" in v3.4For completeness, I also posted the error message when I attempted to save a file with a password in 3.4I can't confirm this error. I downloaded the 3.3 odt from Rob, opened it, changed it and saved it under a new name with anew password with AOO 3.4.1 on MacOS (10.7.5)I've replicated the error on three OS X 10.8 machines over the past few months. I do have one iMac running 10.7, and I will try it there tonight. Note that my first posting describes how I previously encountered the error in 10.7 however. Based on comments, this has already been replicated by others.Thanks, Ernie. The screenshot suggests something is going on, certainly. No one is doubting that. But the aim here is to find a repeatable set of steps that will allow our developers to reproduce the issue on their machines. We're not yet able to do that.Since we've had 3 million or so downloads of AOO 3.4.1 on the Mac, and many of them will have used password-protected files, I'm assuming (but I may be wrong) that the simple, default case in a simple, default configuration, works correctly. Otherwise we'd be seeing many more defect reports here. So the devil is in the details. What are Juergen and I missing in our tests that you are doing?Could it be that this works correctly in a new install, but not in an upgrade?Could there be a dependency on a specific translation? I'm testing with the en-US version of AOO 3.4.1. Are you using a different translation?Regards,-RobI know you don't think I've fabricated images for a screenshot! I am trying to say that I have seen the error on different machines, on different OS X versions, on an Admin account, and on a clean install. In fact, my September post notes that my clean install was on a wiped hard drive... doesn't get much cleaner. I don't know if it was 3.4.1 at the time. My recollection is that last fall I also reproduced the error on a Windows machine as well. I'll play around this week with different scenarios, and I'll see if there's any info that shows up in Console log. Any other ideas/suggestions for trouble shooting?(In reply to)@Ernie, please reply with information on the language of the install you use and also the language settings of your particular computer. Also please identify the browsers installed on your machine. (This is related to some security functions.)Also, in Apache OpenOffice 3.4.x, see if you can find the registrymodifications.xcu document in your configuration information. This is an XML document you can examine. Or you can just upload it to this bug report and one of us will look it over. On Windows the registrymodifications.xcu file is at the end of the user-specific path %APPDATA%\OpenOffice.org\3\user\ where %APPDATA% varies by operating system. On XP SP3 it is C:\Documents and Settings\your-user-id\Application DataOn Windows Vista/7/8 it is C:\Users\your-user-id\AppData\RoamingIn this file, you want there to be two items with ooor:path="/org.openoffice.Office.Common/Save/ODF"one with prop "UseBlowfishInODF12" set to true and the other with prop "UseSHA1InODF12" set to true.WHY THIS IS COMPLICATED (TL;DNR):The password that is entered for saving and for opening a document is converted from UTF8 to an SHA1 hash. That hash is then used to derive the key that is actually used to encrypt/decrypt the file.There are two places where a deviation may occur. If the UTF8 input method is different on two different configurations, the hashes will not agree. This could be an operating system difference, it could be a difference in the open-office operation, or it could be a configuration difference.There are also some default settings that govern *which* hash algorithm is used. If there is a discrepancy between the hash algorithm used when the document was saved and where the attempt to open is happening, that will also fail.Finally, if a document is damaged, you can get the "File cannot be opened" message saying the password is incorrect when that is not actually the problem. This has to do with the fact that Apache OpenOffice doesn't know what the correct password is. It uses the password that is entered, hashes it, etc., to then try decrypting the document. It then checks to see if a decrypted part of the document has the same digital hash as the same part had when the document was encrypted. (This is remembered as part of the metadata in the encrypted document.) There can be a mismatch because of damage and/or because the hashing algorithm used to create the check value when the document was encrypted is different than the one using to check the decryption later. BOTTOM LINE: That is why so many details are needed from you. Also, there were some changes in encryption parameters, but they should not impact documents saved with password in older versions. The older versions use default cases, and it *might* be that some new configurations of Apache OpenOffice are not preserving the default cases properly.Orcmid,I'm running a Mac... there is no registry... let alone a C: drive.(In reply to)There should still be a *file* named registrymodifications.xcu somewhere on your Mac. If it has a different name, one of the developers who works with Mac can tell you about that, and also where to find it. It is part of the user profile for your [Apache] OpenOffice installation and its configuration information.I think we should chalk this up as a problem with the 3.4.0 install... at least, I'm convinced there was a bug there, but it is moot now.I put 3.4.1 on a flash drive, and it ran fine on my 10.6, 10.7, and my other 10.8 machines. This machine is the only one in which I installed 3.4.0 on this drive configuration (meaning, without subsequently wiping the drive. I tried 3.4.0 on other machines last September with identical problems, but subsequently wiped them when I upgraded to OS X 10.8).Tonight, after I removed the 3.4.0 app and deleted the '~\Library\Application Support\OpenOffice.org' folder, 3.4.1 ran successfully.For what it is worth, I did look at the RegistryModification.xcu file. Something didn't seem to match up with what you expected I would see. There was only one instance of:<item oor:path="/org.openoffice.Office.Common/Save/ODF"> <prop oor:name="DefaultVersion" oor:op="fuse"> <value>3</value> </prop></item>Rob's original notice about duplicatetriggered me to look at this posting again. Sorry for what may seem liked wasted effort, but I do appreciate it, since I'm now current with AOO.I give up. It hasn't even been a week, and now once again I can longer open a password saved file in 3.4 or save a file with a password in 3.4.... although 3.3 works fine.I deleted the 'Application Support' files and still the same error.(In reply to)I think these end up under www because it is the only place there is a security category. It is difficult for an user to know that it should be code instead.(In reply to)Can you please provide this information?Ernie, I gather from your later reports that Save with Password and subsequent opening of the saved file worked with Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1 for both saving and opening. And then it stopped working with files saved and opened in 3.4.1 on the same machine? Is that correct? We're trying to control the variables here so that there is something reproducible. That's not possible unless you provide precise details, since no one else has reported the case and others have been unable to provoke it based on your information.I'm sorry this is endlessly frustrating for you. This is a bit like taking your car to the mechanic and their test drives can never provoke the strange noise and steering-column shudder that you experience. I am reopening this because it appears AOO 3.4.1 is not the fix.(In reply to)Oops. It was previously the only place. I see that has changed or else I never found the correct place in the past, either.I'm raising the importance of this because it involves data loss and that is always a serious matter.-- OS language is English.-- AOO 3.4.1 download file I used is Apache_OpenOffice_incubating_3.4.1_MacOS_x86_install_en-US-- Installed browsers are Safari & FirefoxRunning 3.4.1 alone did not fix the saving & opening of password protected files. Deleting the ~/Library/Application Support/OpenOffice.org did seem to fix it... I know I opened and saved a few test files last week.Today, I tried deleting the Application Support files again, but did not get it to work. Curiously, I did get it to it to work today from an administrator account, although I tried that the other week, too, and it was not working previously.(In reply to)There is no data loss here. The user posted an example password-protected file that he could not open and I was able to open it fine.(In reply to)Actually Rob, you posted the file, not me. I only posted screen captures of the error messages. I was always able to open both your test files and my own password protected files in 3.3. And yes, as long as I keep a copy of v3.3 around, there is no data loss.This does not appear to be unique to me, however.(In reply to)Actually, this was a different user who sent me a password-protected file off-line and which I was able to open. It was with this duplicate issue:I'm happy to do the same for you, if you wish, to confirm this.Regards,-RobAlthough my administrator account continued to open the password protected file (stored on an external drive with permissions ignored), I could not do so from my account, even after making my account an administrator.I deleted my account and recreated it, and thus far I am once again able to open password protected files.I see that the Product was changed to Spreadsheet, but that this was not limited to Calc -- the problem was for all password protected files that I tried, including Rob's 3 files attached here.(In reply to)Another variation to try. In Tools | Options | Load/Save | General change the ODF format version option to 1.0/1.1. See if you are able to Save with Password and roundtrip back into your Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1 that way. These should also open with 3.3. If that also fails at some point, that will be useful for us to know.Assuming Save with Password is simply for your own privacy and not sending encrypted files to others, this might help. Experiment with it to ensure this still maintains the fidelity of the files that you work with.AOO 3.4.1 worked initially on my new account, but has once again stopped working... and I can't think of any settings changes or software installs I've done that could have impacted it.I used OO 3.3 to open the password protected .ODS and save it as a 1.0 format spreadsheet (.SXC) as well as Excel (.XLS) -- both with password protection.Restarting AOO 3.4.1, I could not open the .ODS or the .SXC but the .XLS file opened.Without a fix, I guess my choices are to use the file in .XLS format or to continue to use the OO 3.3 version.we would really like to help you but we can't reproduce the problem. Maybe you can try to strip down the content of your document and can share the problematic document with us for further investigation. Make sure that the password is no longer secret and that you can share it with us.(In reply to)I'm not sure how that matters, since it seems pretty clear that the document isn't the problem, for two reasons:1) If you'll look back, you'll see that Rob Weir posted three different kinds of password protected documents. I could not open them in AOO 3.4.1, although I could with OO 3.3.2) Additionally, as I have said, I am not able to create new documents and save them with a password with AOO 3.4.1. Incidentally, for completeness on my earlier post this morning about switching to MS Office format and being able to open password protected files, I am also able to create a new file in AOO 3.4.1 and save it in MS Office with a password.Bump.I've now checked the latest versions of OOo (4.0.1), LibreOffice (4.1.4.2), and NeoOffice (3.4.1). LibreOffice and NeoOffice open my password-protected .ods file just fine. OpenOffice says "The password is incorrect. The file cannot be opened."So whatever the underlying mechanism is, the bug still exists in OOo.As always, I use the file in question regularly, so I am happy to test any beta builds to verify whether or not this bug is fixed.-HClarification: I'm on OS X (10.6.8). And of course by OOo I meant AOO.(In reply to heywood from)Heywood, that is not enough information to confirm that this is the same problem ernie was having.Can you do the following: 1. Open your password-protected file in LibreOffice or NeoOffice. 2. Delete any proprietary information. 3. Save it with a new name and a *different* password, but including any special characters and spaces that you use in the current password (rearranged, of course). 4. Verify that the file opens in LO and NeoO, and does not open in AOO 4.0.1 on your OS X configuration.The idea is to be able to create a non-private saved-with password file that is accepted to the creating application but not AOO 4.0.1.If you are able to do that, upload the file to this bug report and tell us what the password is so we can inspect the file to determine what the problem might be.BONUS POINTS: Save a modified version (1-2 above) without any password. Open it in AOO 4.0.1 and save that with the same password you used in (3). Are all three apps able to open it when it is done that way?(In reply to heywood from)For me, this was a significant enough bug that I ultimately switched to LibreOffice.Added hdu to CC

Submit patch instill have downgrade problem.Pls see: build 350m1(Build:9611)-2012-11-10.According to PVT result, the downgrade issue is not fixed, so reopen itI can't reproduce the problem for plain_11s.xls but I don't have measure the saving time for the older revision.Saving complex_29s.xls seems to be slow and towards the end of the saving process I get a warning box that says The document contains more rows than supported in the selected format. Additional rows were not saved.(In reply tofrom)Can you provide any details why these changes could have a negative performance impact?does not contain this information.Not sure that I can still reproduce slow loading of complex_29.xls. The first two steps of the loading (loading and updating row heights) is quite fast (a couple of seconds). Only the third part (calculation of cell contents) takes a little longer (maybe 10s).Save times are machine dependent, but both saves are close to left column of the table in original Description with AOO410 branch version as pro build. Definitely not close to the 2nd column.
id=121343	Issue:OO Writer does not properly format hyperlink text on page if value for TARGET field under Hyperlink if is too long and above certain length. While testing, the field can accept up to 65534 characters. However, it will fail to display hyperlink on the page if the TARGET string is 65527 characters or longerSteps to Reproduce:In the Target field under Hyperlink, input a string with 65527 characters in length, then click on ApplyExpected Behavior:Hyperlink will display properly formatted on page as http://<string>, where <string> is the inputted string in TARGET fieldActual Behavior:Hyperlink does not display Would it be possible to attach your test document, ideally one that shows 65526 characters working correctly and 65527 characters not working?(In reply to)This is one of the string classes used internally, it can hold only up to STRING_MAXLEN, defined in tools/inc/tools/string.hxxHello.I have been watching this bug reported and I created the file when your steps but the hyperlink is correct. The bug was checked in the platform W7 64BITS AOO 3.4.1 and I was not found it.Could you give the hyperlink that you used or attach a document?CreatedSource document with 65527 characters used for testingI was able to reproduce this issue in certain scenarios.OpenOffice.org Writer 3.4.1AOO341m1(Build:9593) - Rev. 1372282Windows 7 Home Premium, Service Pack 11. Open Writer blank document2. Click Hyperlink button on toolbar or click Insert-->Hyperlink from menu3. Delete any value or whitespace in Target text box if there is any4. Copy Target value from source document (my source document is attached, I used this document to change the Target value for the scenarios listed below)5. Paste [value] into Target field (actual values I used listed below)6. The Target text box shows as blank white, but the cursor location being at the end of the text box and ability to arrow left and right within the text box indicate that some value has been pasted.7. Click ApplyWhen the issue is reproduced, the program appears to do nothing and continues to display the Hyperlink box, so attaching a document that "doesn't work" is the same as attaching a blank document. Values that reproduced the issue (to be used in step 5 above):1. 65527 character string of the repeating letter 'a'- Confirmed that repeating 'a' string of 65526 characters works as expected, although it does add a forward slash on the end, something it doesn't seem to do for scenarios 4 and 5 below [attached]2. aaa-aaaaaaaaa...

Search giant Google will not index URLs over 2047 characters, and technically only 1855 characters results in a URL that works in Google search results (research from 2010)2. Internet Explorer 10’s address bar will only accept and display 2083 characters, although you can still click a URL that is longer.3.

id=121865	I love OOo Writer, mostly. BUT, auto-correct and auto-numbering is driving me, and apparently, many other users, nuts. You can read the user forums to view all the comments for the past few years on this subject.It seems that most, if not all, auto features are ON by default. WHY?????I have tried all the auto-turn-offs I can find and can usually get most of the very annoying autos to go away and let me work. However, auto-numbering will not go away in the latest version, A00341m1 (build 9593) Rev 1372282. I am not the only one to complain about this specific problem. One other person here on Bugzilla has asked for a single toolbar button that will turn off ALL auto-whatevers, and let us do our work in peace.Sometimes, having an auto feature is nice, but not really necessary (for me). Users could turn on what they want and with the BIG RED TURN OFF AUTO button, just have a nicely behaved word processor that leaves them alone when no autos are needed.I know that such a big change as this will require a change in OOo basic design philosophy. But, I am sure you all are up to the challenge!Thank you for considering my, and many other's, simple request. We really do not want to go back to M$ Office. :)--CL What do you mean in "auto-numbering"?***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***CreatedFollow up test document using Open OfficeI tried to replicate this feature regarding auto-numbering/everything in Open Office Writer. The original bug writer refers to version A00341ml/build 9593 but doesn't indicate what operating system he/she used. For purposes of my replication I am using an HP EliteBook 8460p which is running Windows7 and I used Open Office version 3.3. My first impression on reading this bug was, 'Yes! I understand how an automatic setting can be very annoying, especially if you are going back and forth between a conventional paragraph structure and say an outline or bullets.'To replicate I used the above mentioned computer, operating system and software version and did the following.1. I opened OOo Writer 3.32. A default blank word document automatically appeared3. I began typing a several sentences then I hit my enter key and started numbering.4. I used a 1. (1 with a period and 2 spaces after) then typed my sentence. 5. I hit my enter key and typed another sentenceObservation - Automatic numbering came on and a drop down tool bar also appeared specific to 'Numbering and Bullets'. 6. I hit my enter key again. With the cursor on the same line I chose the turn off/on auto numbering icon on the Numbering and Bullet drop down tool bar.Observation - The automatic numbering tool bar disappeared as did the number on the line my cursor was on. My margin returned to normal - as it was before the numbering. I also completed the same steps using an HP compaq tower PC running a Windows XP operating system and OOo Writer 3.3. Following the exact same steps as above I received the same results. The automatic numbering came on via a drop down tool bar and the automatic numbering worked as expected (ie - kept my numbering correct, 1, 2, 3 etc. after I chose the enter key each time). I searched using the tools option and even customize to try to turn the auto number/bullet off. You can for one line using the drop down tool bar that appears and the 'insert unnumbered entry' icon. But I could find no way to stop it always once you start numbering in the appropriate format (i.e. - 1. and a space or 2 spaces). I thought of several follow up tests to complete to see when and how the automatic numbering/bullet system works. Here are some that I tried, see the attachment for specific details. Throughout these tests I used my HP EliteBook 8460p laptop running Windows7 and OOo version 3.3. Here is a list of the tests that I ran: - Numbering/Capital A using 1 space after the period.- Numbering/Capital A using no space after the period.- Numbering/Capital A using no period and 2 spaces.- Numbering/Capital A using no period and 1 space.- Numbering/Capital A using no period and no space. Observations - It matters if there is a period and spacing. Example - when I used a number without a decimal point and 2 spaces the automatic bullet/numbering did not come on. An interesting finding is when I used the period but no spaces - when I hit the enter key for the 2nd line, I got the same number (1) AND a Roman numeral II! Open Office does not automatically 'bullet' letters. I tried upper and lower case letters. I thought this was very interesting.I then tried using characters such as ampersand, percentage and the asterisk. I used periods and spaces as I did above and I again found something interesting. The percentage and ampersand do not activate the automatic bulleting/numbering, however, when I used the asterisk the automatic bulleting/numbering did activate! However, Open Office 3.3 changed the asterisk to a dot or single bullet point. Is this a bug that OOo changed my chosen icon? I also tried a table and numbering within the table. OOo does not number automatically within a table. I then completed a compared to MS Office 2010. Using my HP laptop EliteBook 8460p and running Windows7 and MS Office 2010 I completed the same tests, in the same order, here are my results. MS Word 2010 has no automatic numbering/bullet system. Instead you type what you want then highlight your section that you want numbered or in bullet point format and choose that icon on the toolbar. MS Word 2010 then takes that highlighted section and bullet points it or numbers it to your specification. The problem is that usually the rest of your margins in your entire paper are now off. MS Word 2010 does not automatically bullet/number within a table.Based on my findings either the original bug is fixed or this is a feature of the software. Overall I can see how the automatic bullet/numbering could be an annoyance, however, personally I like it. I like how it works and I feel it works better than MS Word 2010. Please see the attached files of follow up tests and results.CreatedMS Word 2010 testAttachment of MS Word 2010 test of bug.CreatedReplicated auto-numbering/bulleting in OOo WriterI am running Windows 7 on an ASUS U56E Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2450M CPU @ 2.50GHZ (4 CPUS) on OOo version 3.4.1I was able to replicate the bug and have attached a file, showing my auto-numbering/bullets using the editor.In order to test this:1. Open Writer2. Begin numbering and/or bulleting lists.3. You will notice the auto-options enabling.4. In order to change these, you must highlight all the text and right-click, bringing up an option box, with different tabs for different styling options.5. If you check defaults, the defaults are for auto-numbering and indentations.One issue I noticed, is that the auto-lettering actually is broken. I was able to put:A. Sentence oneB. Sentence two C. Sentence three CI. Sentence 4 <--- As you can see it auto-lettered; however not in sequence [as should be D.] D. Sentence five [forced D.] DI. Sentence 6 <--- Another auto-letter indent. Also pushed first D to indentation.(Also in attachment)Which shows that the auto-lettering starts after C. and then indents to CI., which is not the desired progression. So I do deem that this could be an issue, which should be looked into considering that Microsoft Word will give you an option before any auto numbering/bulleting [Tested in Microsoft Word 2007]CreatedNon-replication in Microsoft Word 2007I want to also note, that I do not believe this is a defect, rather a feature which should be enhanced to adhere to similar products. This functionality could be very bothersome, especially in long research papers which may have lots of statistics or bulleting/numbering which could add significant amounts of time, if auto-formatted without the user's intent.No info from author.How exactly has this been resolved irreproducible, when I clearly stated I was able to reproduce it in Writer? I do not believe this status is correct and I feel instead there should be a change of importance if it is not deemed an important enhancement and then change the status to reproduced enhancement.Also, to mark this irreproducible, with a comparable product which allows a pop-up to enable/disable auto-numbering, seems counter productive to the process of creating the best product you can provide.In, when the cursor is in "A. Sentence one" or "B. Sentence two", the Numbering icon is off meaning Writer does not recognize these entries as numbered entries.Please note Apache OpenOffice is not a MS Office clone. Not any behavior witnessed in Word is to be mimiced by Writer.I am aware they are not clones. My purpose is to try and identify any bugs or enhancements for Writer which may significantly increase user's usability, convenience, or satisfaction with the product. if you were to argue that this enhancement is not necessary, I would understand that as a plausible argument against this; however, to point out they are not the same product, questioning my ignorance is disappointing.I assume your disposition stems from not recognizing the original purpose for this report, which was to identify an inconvenient feature of Writer which may benefit from having an option for auto-numbering/bulleting, which I only tried to point out is an option in a "comparable" product.Your, which is a personal interpretation of the original description by CL may have been misunderstood by me.Let's see what others think.***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***

Attached to this bug report is a sample test.csv file that contains two columns as following:john 265345.23sally 5623.51sue 10.32Open the file in Calc 3.4.1 and in the import dialog choose "Fixed width" and place the column separator between the two columns and click on "OK" (screen shot attached). The result will be two columns imported into a spreadsheet. Both columns are text. Each number will have an apostrophe (') and a few spaces, then the text representation of the number (screen shot attached and an ODS file attached).This is a SEVERE regression bug. The problem does not occur in OpenOffice 3.2.1 nor in LibreOffice 4.0.0. (And it doesn't matter if there are commas in the numbers or spaces after the numbers, it still works correctly in older OpenOffices and in Libreoffice 4).From what I can tell, there is no possible workaround and it leaves us unable to upgrade to 3.4.1 because we would no longer be able to import and parse any of our fixed-width reports (which we do a lot).

id=121561	CreatedUse basic hyperbolic and power functions from boost in ScSome functions are known to have poor implementations in most OS's libc. The results can be poor math but also we end up with functions that are highly dependent on the operating system.Boost, OTOH, has excellent implementations of some special functions.I made a proof of concept patch to use Boost implementations of asinh, acosh, and atanh.This may serve as a proof-of-concept to do something similar with other functions and to determine testing procedures for such cases. CreatedA basic spreadsheet to see that things workI tried doing some very basic tests to see if these functions produce consistentresults. The results are inconclusive from a precision POV, I basically only got different results in the last digit in a result in atanh, and a small error with small numbers in in acosh, but it seems pretty similar to the system libraries.More testing with small values of acosh are desirable.CreatedTestcases for PMTHi Pedro.

id=122233	CreatedScreenshotThe styling of the directory is very inexpedient:a) half of the screen width is wasted for empty grey areas at the left and the rightb) advertisement (Latest tech jobs) has more column width than file namesthis might not affect most normal users, but for QA staff finding the required file is a pain.Yes, that's a general Sourcforge website problem (and a fad on many other websites), but the AOO project should have some influence there. And if they do not see a possibility to offer a useful design AOO should find a better solution. @Rainer:This is not fixable from the Apache side. Please contact Roberto from Sourceforge.net at the dev@ malining list. Thanks.@Marcus:Thank you for feedback. Unfortunately I will not do that "contact Roberto", that's not my turf. I report bugs "Somehow related to AOO" in Bugzilla, and that's the only discussion platform I will use, except I explicitly have agreed. I am not involved anywhere in Apache organization (although i am rather busy in Bugzilla), and (like most other "only users") I will not subscribe additional lists, search around for mail addresses or similar.It's discouraging for users to get advice likefrom. If you know who can help, why don't you contact Roberto? I don't know him. It's like in a restaurant, I am not interested in details how the workflow in the restaurant is organized an at what waiter's table I sit, I don't want to get waiter Roberto's phone number to ask him why he is not at work today, I simply want to order my steak within acceptable time. And because I see evidence that from time to time someone will wait for a waiter in vain in AOO Bugzilla I submitted "- Make sure that developers read Bug reports related to their field of activity"And by the way, if AOO uses a download platform with file name columns too narrow for the file names, someone might want to think about shorter filenames ("Apache OpenOffice" already is the heading of the page, may be "AOO_4.0.0...would be sufficient?) or filenames showing the distinguishing part at the beginning of the name, or, or, or.I've mentioned it as I thought you know Roberto already. That was the reason for the short hint. OK, it doesn't seem so. BTW: No need to write half a book of comments. ;-)The filenames in release files are a new topic.I'll set Roberto as assignee. Let's see if he can help.@Roberto:Please can you take over this issue? Thanks.There's a related issue - some of the file sizes are wrong as well.For example, Apache_OpenOffice_4.0.0_Win_x86_install_en-GB.exe shows as 129 MB (136,201,626 bytes) on Windows XP. However on the SF download page e.g. [1] it shows as 136.2 MB.Looks as though the size was divided by 1000 rather than the usual 1024.[1]Those are two separate issues actually.Issue #1 (opened by @rainer )When logged in there are no no ads and there is plenty of room. When not (with ads), the Ad reduces the canvas by about 1/3, which is only enough room to display about half of the particularly long filenames. In that instance, no amount of tinkering with other column widths will free up enough space to make the full name visible.What we might do quickly is a mouse-over effect, so that when the mouse rolls over the filename, the UI expands it in some way to reveal the full name. Would that work for you?Issue #2 (opened by @sebb )Thanks for heads up on that, it's scheduled for the next sprint, check it out at SourceForge ticket system:@Roberto Galoppini:Thank you for feedback! I am not sure whether I understand your suggestion. Are we talking about some kind of tooltipp (it seems that changed since I submitted this report)? I'm afraid that will not help very much. To decide what will be required a human being will want to see the complete list with all relevant info, not to read the file names one by one with mouseover. But of course a clear, simple, readable tooltip can be an improvement, at least with my Seamonkey the result I saw yesterday was much worse than that what I see today.Yea, a tooltip like kind of thing. Think we could do that really quickly, while redesigning the whole page would probably take some time.Did you try to log-in as SourceForge user by any chance?(In reply to Rainer Bielefeld from)I agree. The tooltip is only marginally useful - the same info was previously available by clicking on the (I) button, although that also suffers from lack of space for the full file name, which wraps. And in Firefox at least, the full URL appears at the bottom of the page when hovering over the link.However neither is particularly convenient when looking for the correct file to download.Just discovered that the full file name is shown in Chrome and Opera if Javascript is turned off. So clearly it's possible.CreatedAlso problems in info dialogCurrently also the source forge "Info" field has problems with the long AOO file names (screenshots from Seamonkey browser)But to say it clearly, I want to retain relevent info in the file names, I dislike solutions like "jxpiinstall7.exe" where you never know what version exactly will be installed.I confirm that file names inare cut, but I don't see this issue as much relevant: final users are not supposed to use those links, and those very few people who really need an FTP-like access can use the Apache mirrors: I think the work is still ongoing (you only see checksums at the moment), but Infra is going to provide a fallback ator(ask the dev list if you need more information about this).Roberto: I tried your suggestion to log in at SourceForge; if I openindeed the ads disappear, but the "Latest Tech Jobs" box is still shown (in my case) and it is still in the way, so logging in does not completely solve the problem, unless I'm missing some options in the profile configuration.If you're a project admin and you're logged in file names are not cut. If this is something only AOO folks would need to double check files I believe we could address the issue by having them as project admins.Does it make sense?@Roberto: I doubt that this will help as the normal user has not the special view like the admins. If we want to position this webpage as a kind of last resort for the user to choose their favorite build (when every download scripting fails), then everybody should be able to read the complete filenames. And at the moment IMHO it is indeed better than the Apache mirror system.@Marcus I see Andrea has a different take on the subject, in his opinion that is not a resource aimed at end-users. Maybe we can discuss this further on the dev mailing-list?Note that also Rainer's initial comment seems to be aimed at QA people.@Roberto: Sure, feel free to bring it back to the dev@ mailing list.Feel free to take this to the dev list again, but in short...1) I don't see this as relevant to final users: they will never navigate the SourceForge directory2) Volunteers (and whoever wants to browse directories) can use our (Apache's) infrastructure, that now has exactly the same files, plus checksums, and displays full names: for example, seeUnless I'm missing some use cases, I'd say we can live with it.Thanks @Andrea for the further clarifications. It seems to me all the people interested in the subject are following this issue, I'll wait +72 hrs and lazy-consensus-wise I'll close the ticket if none objects.As per my previous message I'm closing the ticket because it's not relevant to en-users - as per @Andrea feedback, and AOO volunteers as admins of the AOO mirror at SourceForge can get access to those pages with no displayed ads.If you need to be an admin of the AOO mirror feel free to contact me or other admins (e.g. @Marcus).If you think those downloads are not for normal final users, drop all that statistics fripperies and show a normal list like <> or so. <> is not an alternative if you are searching for older versions.Please excuse me for the rude comment, but the current solution is a horrible mess.@Rainer:If you want to get older release, please go to our starting webpage for archived builds:It is not intended that end-users start at Sorceforge.Therefore I think it's OK to leave it as it is.Hi Marcus:I know that mirror here in my hometown, during OOo@sun I was involved (a little) in keeping it running.End-user argument: Of course I know the trick with "Styles = none" in browser, and may be not too many users get astray to there. It's a matter of pride.@Rainer: We at AOO cannot change this. Please get in contact with Roberto from Soureforge. He is the only one who (may) can help you.As withthis is no issue of Apache OpenOffice but SourceForge. So, it has to be fixed there. Closing this issue.I am dissatisfied with the way this conversation went, especially with regard to folks who are by no means typical end-users claiming what end-users might or might not do.We already had an example of a QA person (probably a power user) needing to see the details. Also, kicking the can to SourceForge is strange. It is about how a service for us works for *our* users, not typical SourceForge users. (And so being logged in is a strange condition.)I think this should remain open until we have the people who claim it is important to improve are fully heard. I just don't think it makes sense to tell end-users that they need to negotiate with SourceForge themselves.And Roberto, as a member of the AOO PMC is a great candidate to carry the word to SourceForge, as he has done here. I don't want to minimize that and that he offered something that could be done immediately to improve the situation. The issue about ad placement is a companion concern and needs its own consideration.(In reply to orcmid from)This is more than 1 year old and there is no further discussion. Also there are no further interested people on the CC list - besides the usual listeners. ;-)I find it strange that you want to draw a special relation here.SourceForge is no service for or from Apache or OpenOffice. We are using its great service and they serve it to many, many others, too.When other projects on SourceForge also use long file names like we do, then they would see the same problem. I haven't looked around but, again, it's no special problem that belongs to OpenOffice alone.Why should a issue stay open that has no attention and no further comments?And end-users do not need to search on SourceForge. For this we have our own download webpage.Right, Roberto is the right one to try to change it. AFAIK he knows the issue but there is no solution until today. So, maybe it's not technically possible without to change much more on their webpage.@orcmid:Sorry, but I don't think that this issue is right placed in the issue tracker of OpenOffice due to the reasons I stated above. But to do something constructive I will notify Roberto (again) about the problem reported in this issue.I'm using Firefox with NoScript AddOn. I see the complete filenames. But the reason is that all scripts are disabled. If I allow the execution of scripts from fsdn.com the table will formatted, so that the filenames are cropped.(In reply to Marcus from)Thank you Marcus. I see you doing that on the dev@ list.(In reply to Marcus from)For me, this kind of silence on an obvious usability issue is something to taken as an indication that someone gave up on us. The issue did not disappear. Confidence in the project to take users seriously may have disappeared.The problem is we don't often get to know. I don't think we are taking the fact that users took something seriously enough to figure out how to submit a buzilla issue, and then go away a short time later, is probably not a good sign. These are the only indicators that we have that maybe others take themselves away without saying anything, not seeing it as their job, or for whatever other reasons they might have.Sorry for. It isn't helpful.But without a suggestion how a solution could look, I can't see what sourceforge should do.Maybe the script implements a switch that toggles the columns "Modified" and "Size" on/off. But this will work also only for a limited length of filenames.Maybe the filenames will separated by cutting in the middle:Apache_OpenOffice_....tar.gz doesn't make it better ...I think the problem is the filename itself. If one download more than one file (version/language/...) one has the same problem with different file managers.(see)What aboutAOO_Lin64_deb_en-GB_inst_4.2.1.tar.gzAOO_Lin32_rpm_en-GB_inst_4.2.1.tar.gzAOO_Mac64_en-GB_inst_4.2.1.dmgAOO_Win32_en-GB_inst_4.2.1.exe(for future: AOO_Win64_en-GB_inst_4.2.1.exe)andAOO_Lin64_deb_en-GB_lang_4.2.1.tar.gzAOO_Lin32_rpm_en-GB_lang_4.2.1.tar.gzAOO_Mac64_en-GB_lang_4.2.1.dmgAOO_Win32_en-GB_lang_4.2.1.exe(for future: AOO_Win64_en-GB_lang_4.2.1.exe)?If these filenames truncated as now, the important information will stay visible.(In reply to mroe from)I know the file names are long but when we change the structure again then we have a total mess in the download scripting with much more exceptions that needs to be checked and deopending on the results different code parts have to be executed. So, please not. ;-)And it won't help for other projects on SourceForge.The problem (at least what I can see) is the "Recommended Projects" box on the right hand side. If this could be re-positioned, then the filenames have the full space that is needed.I've checked this with Firebug in Firefox. When deleting the box and disabling the fixed width for the files, then it's perfect.

id=121457	Lucene was recently updated to version 2.9.4.We can bump Lucene up to version 3.6.x without trouble (tested on FreeBSD).After some feedback from Steve Rowe from Apache Lucene, this would let us use new features in modern Lucene:- In HelpIndexerTool.java, for Japanese, we use CJKAnalyzer. In Lucene version 3.6, a new Japanese morphological analyzer was added (the kuromoji module) - this would definitely do a better job of searching Japanese content.- We use NIOFSDirectory, both when searching and indexing, but this is slow on Windows. Here's a blog post about a better alternative (MMapDirectory) when using Lucene 3.1+ with 64-bit JVMs: <> - it mentions the NIOFSDirectory issue too. FSDirectory.open() knows about these issues and tries to pick the best option for you.Implementing this the help system would be much faster. This also requires adapting the long_path patch to apply for the upstream version.There seems to be little interest in this.The issue is still valid, even if progress is slow. I don't think it should be marked WONTFIX.If you disagree, then please follow the process described in the wiki, and raise the issue on the dev mailing list:Thanks!-Robwe should directly analyze an update to the latest version 4.7

I find all "light" colors are translated.Can we close this as fixed in 4.0.1? Any bugs with color names left?Note that upgrading 3.x -> 4.x can leave you with some untranslated color names due the fact that the palette is different and some colors were not kept in the 4.x palette. But Rainer reported this on a new profile, so this is not the case under consideration here.Already Reproducible with "AOO 4.0.1 RC3 – German UI / German locale [ Rev. 1524958 2013-09-20 11:40:29]" on German German WIN7 Home Premium (64bit)", Common 4.0-dev User ProfileAlso Reproducible with "AOO 4.0.1 RC3 – Swedish UI / Swedish locale [ Rev. 1524958 2013-09-20 11:40:29]" on German German WIN7 Home Premium (64bit)" own separate user profile. So (also due to) this problem might have some more methodical roots than simply missing translation?CONFIRMED due to this report with different version in different installation.CreatedScreenshots for 4.0.1RC3Attached you find comparison of 4.0.1 RC3 Screenshots German - SwedishI see them normally in AOO301m5 (RC3) Italian. Maybe you are using the old palette somehow? "Brown", for example, appeared to me in English in one occasion, when I told OpenOffice to import personal data (and this includes the palette, see Release Notes) from the 3.x profile. But it shouldn't be part of the new palette.Yes, it's <> Color palette.I think many people (like me) want to keep the old color palette, we have lots of colors in many documents, styles and so on, and we really do not have the time to think about what might happen if suddenly my software uses a new color palette. So I think many people will keep old color scheme intendedly, and for all these users Help will look buggy without translationForinthe strings for the old colours were removed (at that time, there were no plans to migrate the colour palette from the previous AOO version, so the strings became unused code).It looks like they should be reintroduced.Setting Armin on Cc(In reply to Ariel Constenla-Haile from)That would be great. Do you know whether there is some "migration guide" what eases decision whether a user should migrate or not? And if he switches to the new palette, how to do that?Not directly related (and may be just the opposite), but same area, so I add "- Missing translation for new Gradients" to "See also".ALG: Hmmm. I am not sure how useful it will be to keep translations of old palette entries/gradients. I see tat it may look not too good when using the old palette with AOO401, but:- We will not be able to always do this when palettes change- Selfmade palettes will also have no translated colors- Not sure if the translation how it is done today will even work with non-existent entiresMaybe the best solution would be if that translation list could be given in a separate xml file, or in the palette xml files themselves. This would be a nice task for someone looking for a starter task: Collect and build a translation table for color palettes and other entries. But beware: These translations are used to mach UNO API commands, so this has to work reliable, and I am not sure if it would e.g. be allowed to have no translation for existing colors...I would say this is fixed and I see no untranslated entries in the mentioned drop down boxplease verifyThe discussion makes it clear that this is not fixed.This bug is only visible if someone migrated their color palette from 3.x to 4.x (the colors that were removed in 4.x will not have translated names), so if you looked at Pootle or at a new installation the problem is not visible.If it is to be considered resolved for the reasons Armin stated, then it's a WONTFIX.ah ok now I understand and I agree that the problem still exists. And I would say that it won't be fixed. I see currently no logical way to do that. Which translations do we want to preserve? The way how we handle today translations for this item makes it nearly impossible. The only usable way would be to store the translation in the palette in the user profile.maybe to early to set it on won't fix and reopen the issue.If somebody has a good idea ...
id=122899	Enhancement request to have a way to resize an image using a percentage ratio. Thank you for this good suggestion.Feature already exists. Right click image and choose "Crop picture" from the context menu. Set the percentage in the section "Scale".Both Marco and Edwin fail to locate feature -> feature poorly located.Percentage scaling of image should be under Position and Size...Or better yet, fields width and height should accept percentage input alongside inch, centimeter etc.With your permission, I reopen this bug for intuition sake.I am by no means an expert but in my mind, cropping is not the same thing as resizing. Cropping usually means dropping parts of the image while keeping the same resolution whereas resizing allows you to keep the full image but make it smaller or bigger.With that in mind, the feature Regina points out belongs in the Position and Size dialog box.
id=123302	Current situation with "AOO 4.0.1 RC2 – German UI / German locale [AOO401m5(Build:9714) - Rev. 1523756 2013-09-16 20:50:21]" on German German WIN7 Home Premium (64bit)", Common 4.0-dev User Profile:It is possible to define Groups, for example for a columns range D:H. If you do not need to see information in those columns, you can simple switch off those columns using 'Group and outline' and make the columns visible again if you need to see those columns. That's a nice tool, but that does not cover all my needs. I have many spredsheets with many columns, where for several "standard business" I would like to hide several single columns, let's say D,F,H,J,L,N,O, to avoid excessive scrolling during my work. And for a different standard business I would like to hide E,G,J-L, P, also to avoid excessive horizontal scrolling.So for me it would be great if definitions in 'Data - Group and outline' also would be possible for such disconnected column ranges with a proceeding:1. <control+click> column headings D,F,H,J,L,N,O > only columns D,F,H,J,L,N,O become selected2. 'Data -> Group and outline -> Group' (Currently impossible, greyed) > Croup created, Buttons '1' and '2' and 'Collapse Minus' appear above column headings > from now on '-' will hide columns D,F,H,J,L,N,O and '+' will make columns visible again Why don't use hyperlinks to avoid excessive scrolling?Why not arrange document so columns to be hidden are contiguous?No info from author.@Edwin Sharp:You misunderstand intention, you idea with links is not useful.An example might be some kind of price list with 20 columns of information like Order number manufacturer, Order Number supplier, alternative supplier, list price, transfer factor, net. price, latest ordered, items on stock, and so on and so on. This might need 4 screen widths. If you want to update the prices from a printed Katalog, it might be useful to see only columns A,E,G,M,O.For stocktaking you only want to see A,G,M,PFor some other work only B,D,F,NCurrently I use macros to hide the columns with unnecessary information for particular work, but using groups would be much more comfortable.
id=123973	CreatedThe errror backup message windowHi,When option "always create a backup file" is chosen (documentation separate problem function not well explained), when you save the current file the previous version (content of the temp file) is saved as normal file but with an index number with increment at the end of the file name.This lead to a writing backup file error.The main file is then not updated the lonely solution is to save as.Can too change the option this functions dynamically.On the way to search the origin :When you try to save the file .~lock.<name>>.odt# is updatedA file with previous content with name "<name>n.odt" previous date with previous content (n is first integer for a not existing filename : should increment)I have no gone farther. In this case there is probably an open-close-rename file between lock and backup crossed.It is easy to reproduce and check (moving current files, changing the option)Good luckBest regards Found :When repairing (or install ? not able to check quickly) the missing (not yet created) ../user/backup/ subdir is not created.Then when OOE tries to write the backup file the error is produced.Remains to :- check when the subdir is not created- when error occurs hold it by checking the dir and if not exist create it (try to) and retry backup file creation.Best regardsPlease specify simple steps to reproduce bug.No info from author.Hi,Sorry, long time kept by other problems I have not seen your request.I found the exact reason several days after opening the case.1- Consider that accidentally the backup subdir has been deleted, empty because the user have not chosen the option (detail about reasons : because of trojan attack the user is copied - as recommended by MS - but the subdir "backup" is not copied because empty, sure an error but this occurs)2- You need to run the "repair" option of the installation of AOOe-4.0.13- Then you change the option for "backup"4- When you start AOOe crashes because it tries to write to a non existing path.I reproduced it before writing.Secondarly :Because of this first crash the incremental copy with version numbering crashes to, the user result is that without any more message he cannot save his current file... (unefficient)Elements of software solution : 1- because this situation is exceptional it is the error handler which must test the existence of the subdir "backup" when the writing error occurs, then create and return to execution.2- the repair installation must test if the subdir exists, if not (deleted accidentally) create itWaitingtrying to reproducewhen repair error message "Please exit OpenOffice ..."AOO410m1(Build:9750) - Rev. 1560574Rev.1560574Win 7reopened
id=123544	When a file picker is created using the following code, the directory and filename are not set when the file picker is shown. This happens in Windows 7; in Ubuntu 12.10 (using OpenOffice 4) it works as expected.Here, "originalUrl" is the URL taken from the currently open document; "Environment" is just a helper class to retrieve some information about the opened document.Object oFilePicker = component_factory.createInstanceWithContext("com.sun.star.ui.dialogs.FilePicker", Environment.getContext());XFilePicker xFilePicker = (XFilePicker) UnoRuntime.queryInterface(XFilePicker.class, oFilePicker);xFilePicker.setMultiSelectionMode(false);if (originalUrl == null) { xFilePicker.setDisplayDirectory(Environment.getHomeDir()); xFilePicker.setDefaultName("");}else { int idx = originalUrl.lastIndexOf('/'); if (idx >= 0) { xFilePicker.setDisplayDirectory(originalUrl.substring(0, idx)); xFilePicker.setDefaultName(originalUrl.substring(idx+1)); }}Steps to reproduce:1. Create a new extension which shows a file picker using the code mentioned above.2. Install the extension in LibreOffice in Windows.2. Run LibreOffice in Windows.3. Open an LibreOffice-compatible document.4. Run the extension.Current behavior:The file picker doesn't start where the opened document is saved nor the filename of the document is set as default filename.Expected behavior:The default directory and filename of the file picker is the same as the opened document. (In reply to Ariel D. Moya Sequeira from)Some comments:- This is OpenOffice bugzilla, did you reproduce the bug with OpenOffice?- are you using the system file dialog?1) I filed the bug in LibreOffice first, then here. However, the issue exist in both applications. I reproduced the issue using OpenOffice 4.0.1 (in Windows).2) I just use the file picker made available by the UNO interface. Apart from that, I do not use SWT/Swing file pickers.(In reply to Ariel D. Moya Sequeira from)If you go to the menu Tools - Options..., in the Options dialogue go to OpenOffice - General, there is an option to use OpenOffice dialogues instead of the system one.IIRC this option is off by default, so you might be using the system dialogue.CreatedWriter document with a macro to testThanks for the support.Indeed, when I switched to the OpenOffice's save dialog, the code now behaves as expected. It works as expected on Windows and Linux after the switch.Anyone may change the status of this ticket as NOTABUG or WONTFIX if the behavior using system's dialogs won't be fixed at all.(In reply to Ariel Constenla-Haile from)This one crashes on Windows 7, it isn't setting any filter, so the following code tries to access element 0 of an empty vector:On 3.4.1 it does not crash (but the dialog does not show up). The crash is likely a regression introduced by stlport removal.hResult = iDialog->GetFileTypeIndex(&nFileType);will return S_OK but nFileType will be 0 when no filters were specified.So the check should be:if ( SUCCEEDED(hResult) && nFileType > 0 )this would already prevent accessing an empty vector, any way it would be safer to check nRealIndex against the vector actual size.Altogether:if ( bValue ){ ::rtl::OUString aExt; UINT nFileType; hResult = iDialog->GetFileTypeIndex(&nFileType); if ( SUCCEEDED(hResult) && nFileType > 0 ) { ::sal_Int32 nRealIndex = (nFileType-1); // COM dialog base on 1 ... filter container on 0 .-) ::std::vector< COMDLG_FILTERSPEC > lFilters = lcl_buildFilterList(m_lFilters); if ( nRealIndex < lFilters.size() ) { LPCWSTR lpFilterExt = lFilters[nRealIndex].pszSpec; lpFilterExt = wcsrchr( lpFilterExt, '.' ); if ( lpFilterExt ) aFileURL += reinterpret_cast<const sal_Unicode*>(lpFilterExt); } }}(In reply to Ariel D. Moya Sequeira from)There is a bug, besides the crash.The API should work even when using the system dialog.In the meantime, while this bug gets fixed, try not using in your code the system file picker. You can force this (even if the user interface is using the system file picker) with the service name:"com.sun.star.ui.dialogs.OfficeFilePicker"instead of "com.sun.star.ui.dialogs.FilePicker"This bug can be confirmed, independently of the API, just in the user interface:- New Writer document- type anything- press the Save buttonThe default display directory will be set to "file://C:/Users/ariel/Documents", the default file name will be set to "Untitled 1" (in the debugger, watch m_sDirectory and m_sFilename).Bug: the file picker opens in the last used directory (C:\User\ariel\Downloads in my case), not the one set.This can be reproduced also with the macro in(once fixed the crash).Setting hdu on CC for the crash described in(In reply to Ariel Constenla-Haile from)the index is negative: afterhResult = iDialog->GetFileTypeIndex(&nFileType);nFileType is 0. Then::sal_Int32 nRealIndex = (nFileType-1);nRealIndex is -1..Thanks for analyzing the problem! The fix suggested inlooks good to me, please commit it. If this isn't possible for whatever reasons 'll be happy to do it."arielch" committed SVNinto trunk:i123544 - Prevent accessing empty filters' vectorsvnbz message delay caused by perl problems after Bugzilla 4.4.1 updateFixed with Ariel's commit above. Thanks!only fixes the crash. The problem reported here is still there (not only using the API, but in the user interface).The whole code inhas a wrong approach:if there is a default directory and a file name, the code generates a file URL (directory + / + filename + extension), and the default directory is only set if this file exists (ll. 933 ss.); this is a nonsense, because when you are saving a file, this file does not exist yet, so FindFirstFile fails.From my point of view the crash is fixed. Right? Thus, I am removing keyword 'crash'I also does not look like as the described defect is a regression. Right?If yes, please remove keyword 'regression'. Thx in advance.removing keyword 'regression'it seems setting the directory works, if the filpicker is initialized:REM ***** BASIC *****OPTION EXPLICITSub Main Dim dlg as Object dlg = CreateUnoService( "com.sun.star.ui.dialogs.FilePicker" ) Dim Dialogtyp(0) DialogTyp(0) = com.sun.star.ui.dialogs.TemplateDescription.FILESAVE_AUTOEXTENSION dlg.initialize(DialogTyp()) dlg.Title = "Test"' dlg.DisplayDirectory = "file:///c:/users" dlg.DisplayDirectory = "file:///c:/"' this will crash aoo401:' dlg.DefaultName = "xxx" If dlg.Execute = 1 Then MsgBox dlg.SelectedFiles(0)End Subcould someone please confirm?btw: issue "- FilePicker Dialog "setDisplayDirectory" ignored" seems a dupe of this issueCan confirm, with initializing it works.no, i mistakenly thought it will work, but it will only work the *first* time. after a file has been saved, the display directory will always point to thelast save path. run macro twice, second time change "dlg.DisplayDirectory"to a different directory.Sub Main Dim dlg as Object Dim oDoc as Object Dim mNoArgs() Dim sURL as String dlg = CreateUnoService( "com.sun.star.ui.dialogs.FilePicker" ) Dim Dialogtyp(0) DialogTyp(0) = com.sun.star.ui.dialogs.TemplateDescription.FILESAVE_AUTOEXTENSION dlg.initialize(DialogTyp()) dlg.Title = "Test" sURL = "private:factory/swriter" oDoc = StarDesktop.loadComponentFromURL(sURL, "_blank", 0, mNoArgs)' dlg.DisplayDirectory = "file:///c:/users" dlg.DisplayDirectory = "file:///c:/temp" If dlg.Execute = 1 Then sURL = dlg.SelectedFiles(0) oDoc.storeToURL(sURL, mNoArgs) EndIfEnd Subyou're right, I have to stand corrected.So the only solution seems to be to switch to the OpenOffice dialogs with Basic temporarily.CreatedUses Open or Save dialogs with different templatesAfter several tests with macros, here are my conclusions explaining the variability of observations regarding the default directory displayed by the system FilePicker (service SystemFilePicker).The attached document contains macros that prove my point.The FilePicker can use different templates, through initialization. For file opening you can use:FILEOPEN_SIMPLEFILEOPEN_READONLY_VERSION FILEOPEN_LINK_PREVIEW FILEOPEN_PLAY FILEOPEN_LINK_PREVIEW_IMAGE_TEMPLATEEach of these templates "remembers" the last directory where a file was selected.Also, each file saving template "remembers" the last directory where a file is to be stored.The storage of these directory addresses is handled by Windows, not by Apache OpenOffice.With the macro, set a specific directory for a given template, then close Apache OpenOffice. If you have LibreOffice on the same computer it will be used as default directory when running the macro with the same template!This problem of display directory did not appear on previous versions of Windows and of OpenOffice, see.I still use OpenOffice.org 1.1.5 that works perfectly well on Windows 7, but displays an old-fashioned dialog box.Since Windows Vista, the recommended open/save dialog has changed from Common File dialog to Common Item Dialog. See Microsoft docI suspect OpenOffice tried to follow Microsoft recommendation.if one uses setDisplayDirectory() to set a directory it should work as expectedthe current behaviour is not acceptable, e.g. it still works on Win XP but not on Win 7.btw:FilePicker Dialog "setDisplayDirectory" ignored seems to be a dup of this issueThis issue was suggested as a 4.1.2 release blocker.Status: the issue has a patch available, but this patch only covers a crash and it is already included both in trunk and in AOO410 (so, among others, in OpenOffice 4.1.1 and to-be 4.1.2). We don't have a patch available for the filepicker problem, but we have a detailed description by Ariel (at the code level) in.As for two other filepicker issues that were nominated for 4.1.2, I'm forwarding to the API list for evaluation but in order to fix it in time for 4.1.2 we will need an interested developer to show up.i think there is a "workaround" for the "setDisplayDirectory" problem:setting "/org.openoffice.Office.Common/Path/Info.WorkPathChanged" = trueseems to force the folder change. see attached macro for details.VistaFilePickerImpl.cxx:void VistaFilePickerImpl::impl_sta_SetDirectory(const RequestRef& rRequest){ bool bForce = rRequest->getArgumentOrDefault(PROP_FORCE, false); [...] if ( m_bInExecute || bForce ) iDialog->SetFolder(pFolder);}VistaFilePicker.cxx:void SAL_CALL VistaFilePicker::setDisplayDirectory(const ::rtl::OUString& sDirectory) { [..] bool bChanged(false); if (( aValue >>= bChanged ) && bChanged ) { ::comphelper::ConfigurationHelper::writeDirectKey( m_xSMGR, aPackage, aRelPath, aKey, css::uno::makeAny(false), ::comphelper::ConfigurationHelper::E_STANDARD); }[...] rRequest->setArgument(PROP_FORCE, bChanged);}OPTION EXPLICITSub Main() Call TestSetdialog("file:///d:/test") Call TestSetdialog("file:///d:/temp") Call TestSetdialog("file:///d:/test") Call TestSetdialog("file:///d:/temp")End SubSub TestSetdialog(ByVal sPath as String) Dim dlg as Object Dim oDoc as Object Dim mNoArgs() Dim sURL as String dlg = CreateUnoService( "com.sun.star.ui.dialogs.FilePicker" ) Dim Dialogtyp(0) DialogTyp(0) = com.sun.star.ui.dialogs.TemplateDescription.FILESAVE_AUTOEXTENSION dlg.initialize(DialogTyp()) dlg.Title = "Test" sURL = "private:factory/swriter" oDoc = StarDesktop.loadComponentFromURL(sURL, "_blank", 0, mNoArgs) Dim oConfigProvider as Object Dim oRegistryKeyContent as Object Dim aNodePath(0) as new com.sun.star.beans.PropertyValue oConfigProvider = createUnoService("com.sun.star.configuration.ConfigurationProvider") aNodePath(0).Name = "nodepath" aNodePath(0).Value = "/org.openoffice.Office.Common/Path/Info" oRegistryKeyContent = oConfigProvider.createInstanceWithArguments("com.sun.star.configuration.ConfigurationUpdateAccess", aNodePath()) oRegistryKeyContent.WorkPathChanged = true oRegistryKeyContent.commitChanges dlg.DisplayDirectory = sPath If dlg.Execute = 1 Then sURL = dlg.Files(0) oDoc.storeAsURL(sURL, mNoArgs) EndIfEnd SubThe corresponding bug in LO isI have looked at the problem too. The method setDisplayDirectory is used internally too. I have tried to force the implementation to take the string sDirectory from the [in] parameter. RequestRef rRequest(new Request()); rRequest->setRequest (VistaFilePickerImpl::E_SET_DIRECTORY); rRequest->setArgument(PROP_FORCE, true); rRequest->setArgument(PROP_DIRECTORY, sDirectory);// rRequest->setArgument(PROP_FORCE, bChanged);That works for calls in a macro, but then on other places no longer the previous directory is used in the file dialog -as it should be-, but the default directory.Another question is, what is the purpose of the user setting item WorkPathChanged? Until now I have not found a place where this setting is evaluated. Inside the method it is not needed, because independent of its value, PROP_FORCE is always set to "false", only that in addition the user setting in registrymodifications.xcu is set to "false" in addition and remains so.The file open/save dialogs for graphics have their own implementations in FileDialogHelper in sfx2/source/dialog/filedlghelper.cxx. It might be, that it is needed to divide the usage via API from internal usage in other cases too.To me it looks as if there are so many question around this method, that there is no quick, well thought out solution for 4.1.2.When I use the solution for Basic from Oliver from, then it opens with the correct directory. But when the user goes to a different directory in the dialog, after finish of "execute" the property "DisplayDirectory" is not updated. Nevertheless the new directory is stored somewhere, because the file picker from Insert > File or creating a new file picker dialog in the macro will use it.[To test the content of "DisplayDirectory" in Basic you need to patch AOO, look at](In reply to Regina Henschel from)OK. Then this will not be considered as a blocker for 4.1.2, since we have no patch (there is a patch in the issue, but it fixes a crash and it is already fixed in 4.1.1 and in trunk, so no action needed for 4.1.2) and no feedback from the API list.Uses Open or Save dialogs with different templatesAfter several tests with macros, here are my conclusions explaining thevariability of observations regarding the default directory displayed by thesystem FilePicker (service SystemFilePicker).The attached document contains macros that prove my point.The FilePicker can use different templates, through initialization.

id=124238	I'm requesting the option: To create a pair of link anchors or markers such that clicking on one navigates to the other & vice versa. This is available in HTML, the term for it is "bidirectional hyperlinks".Pls refer to web link:ScenarioSuppose that i want to create a writer document that contains 2 text strings. Associated with each text string is a marker of the form [n], one next to the 1st text string & one next to the 2nd text string.I want to be able to click on the markers to navigate either from the 1st text marker to the 2nd text string marker or vice versa. I do not understand, what is special to need a request. You do it in OpenOffice the same way as described for HTML:Mark the text [1] and assign bookmark "One".Mark the text [2] and assign bookmark "Two".Mark the text [1] or double-click bookmark "One" in Navigator.Insert hyperlink with target document, write Two into Target field, Apply, Close.Mark the text [2] or double-click bookmark "Two" in Navigator.Insert hyperlink with target document, write One into Target field, Apply, Close.worksAOO410m1(Build:9750) - Rev. 1565724Rev.1565724Win 7This is an interesting idea (although at first I was reminded of the comefrom [] command :-). But the link ingives a good example for the use of a bidirectional hyperlink.But this is clearly a feature request not a bug description and therefore not a blocker (changing status accordingly.)describes a work around but the I think that the reporter had something less manual and more user friendly in mind. Therefore I reopen the issue. It is a valid feature request.The Footnote/Endnote functionality allows movement from the anchor to the footnote/endnote and return to the anchor location by clicking on the footnote/endnote reference number. This bidirectionality could perhaps easily be copied and applied to hyperlinks.Thank you Andre for clarifying things, & LOL on the link. A 1000 apologies for submitting this as an issue, my mistake. I'm writing manuals with so many of these bidirectional links & am quite familiar with the procedure outlined in, but its too time consuming for so many links.My BOSS wants to jump to the footnote, read it, then jump right back to where he was on the text. I just work here...But, honestly I think its a highly used feature by all those ppl who are reading & writing books & dont want to go thru a lengthy Book marking/hyperlinking process.As for footnotes I dont think they READILY link back.RGDS
id=122916	I upgraded to version 4.0.0 since then I can not resize the size of the comment in the spreadsheet. It allow me to insert it but it will not allow to grab the corner and make it bigger as I was able to do in version 3.#.#.Is this a "bug" or I must do it a different more complicated way?Thanks, Emil. After you have written something leave the comment and show it. Single click on it and then you can drag it. If you insert a comment newly, you are immediately in edit mode, and in edit mode resizing is not possible. Version 3.4 behaves the same only that handles were shown although they were effectively not usable.This could be a RFE to modify the behaviour of the ESC key in Calc comments to behave like with text shapes:- insert a comment, you are in edit mode- press ESC, the comment "shape" shows handles to resize it- press ESC a second time, the comment is hiddenNow, the first ESC hides the comment, you have to show it in order to resize it.When insert a comment and then try to first resize it, leaving the edit mode with Esc does not switch to object mode but finishes the whole action. Request: Escape from edit mode should switch to object mode to be able to set size and position of comment.After recently upgrading from version 3.4 to 4.0.1, I experienced this same problem. Used to be able to resize the text box of the comment while editing. Now the only way to resize is to exit the editing mode, go to Show Comment, and then get handles to adjust text box size. Can Comment be changed to permit adjustment of text box size while editing the text?I do not know of a verion where the comment was resizable directly after creation, in edit mode.

id=125636	CreatedSample data file using comma as decimal pointSaving a .csv file uses the language setting of the system, not the language setting the file was opened with. As an example is attaced a small .csv file using comma (,) as decimal point and tab as separator. It can be correctly opened/imported specifying e.g. Danish language setting. However, when the file is saved, the current systems language setting will be used. If the system language setting is e.g. English, it will be saved with period (.) as decimal point.Or inversely: I use Danish language setting, but also work with files where period (.) is used as decimal point. If I edit them in Calc (choosing Language as English in the Open dialogue) and saves them as .txt or .csv file, I afterwards have to re-open in Notepad to change all "," to ".".One way to fix this could be to add "Language" setting as a choice in the Save dialogue for .csv and .txt files (like in the Open dialogue for .csv). Preferentially, the default setting of the language setting should be the same as was used for opening the file.This issue on exporting .csv files can be seen as a mirror of issue ID 49978 about IMPORTING .csv files.--Lars J Since my original posting I have found a work-around: If I change the formatting language for the cells, then saving as CSV will save with the decimal point of that formatting. But I have to do this manually - Calc does remember which languange I opened the file as.This could easily be implemented as an enhancement.Enhancement proposal: When importing/opening Text CSV files, the "language" setting in the cell formatting should be the language specified during import. (If no language is specified, this defaults to the default language.)Consequences: When opening a Text CSV file, the user is already presented with the Text import dialog box, which gives the possibility of specifying a language. Users not changing the default language will not experience any difference.Users deliberately chaning the language from the default setting will both SEE and SAVE the data in the same format.--Lars JHave a look at.*** This issue has been marked as a duplicate of***(In reply to mroe from)This feature request has nothing to do withwhich was about the global locale and the number format locale to override the global one. IMHO, this request results from popular misconceptions about csv. The text import locale serves another purpose and it can not be overridden. It provides an interpretation schema for incoming text.1. CSV is not a spreadsheet format. It is completely unrelated to spreadsheets even though many millions of users never load csv into any type of application other than spreadsheets. Valid csv is entirely about database exchange (record sets with equal number of fields of distinct types). 2. CSV must not make _any_ assumptions about formatting attributes. There are no number formats, date formats, text colors, row borders, fonts, font sizes or anything like that in a plain text file. In an ideal world all csv date/times would be ISO-date/times and all numbers would be decimals with digits, a minus sign for negative numbers and one decimal point where needed, but with no thousands-separators, currency symbols nor decimal separators other than point.Calc interpretes the incoming text snippets in the given context of the import locale set in the import dialog and then dumps the resulting numbers (and text) into a brand new unformatted spreadsheet which is not even derived from your default template.The only "formatting" that takes place is the formatting of number format "General" which displays all special numbers (dates, times, percent, currencies, booleans) in one particular number format, otherwise dates would be displayed as integers (what they actually are once they landed in a sheet). Number format "General" provides one number format for each subtype.I think, it is perfectly OK to not interprete any formatting attributes from incoming text. This automagic formatting would be extremely difficult to implement for many thousands of possible number formats. Furthermore, the uniform number format indicates clearly that the incoming text has been interpreted correctly.Formatting imported text data:1) Use a template and then menu:Insert>Sheet_form_File. Then you can apply the template's cell styles within seconds.2) Open the csv, copy all and paste-special data into a second, pre-formatted spreadsheet.3) Use Base connected to a csv-directory and use pre-formatted import ranges (F4, drag&drop)4) Some macro driven solution performing 1), 2) or 3) automatically.[Example] Loading CSV into preformatted spreadsheets[Tutorial] Using registered datasources in Calc:I'm sorry, it is not possible to save the locale in a CSV file. This enhancement request is to reuse the locale specified on open (if different) for saving. That is, it is preservation from open to save, not save to open.It is correct that this is an enhancement request.I concur withand have re-opened the issue.(In reply to Andreas Säger from)If 124654 would be solved then the selected locale at csv import could be saved in the resulting calc sheet. This was my intention. What do I misunderstand?You can save the locale within the document. Change the number format locale of the default cell style. This affects all other cell styles where the locale is not set otherwise.Agreed, CSV is not a spreadsheet format and formatting cannot be saved in a CSV file. CSV is a simple-but-not-too-well-defined data format. And any application (such as Calc) interpreting the contents as more than simply a text file, must make assumptions about the interpretation.When I open a CSV file, I am given the chance to state some of these assumptions:- is the delimitor character the standard comma (,) or another character?- which character set should be assumed?- which language settings should be assumed?My choices in the loading process influences how the contents of the file is interpreted by Calc. Most specifically, the language setting will influence how decimal numbers and dates are read. For instance:- Is 1,23 a valid number? With language setting Danish it is, with language settings English it is not.- Does 01-03-2015 means January 3rd or March 1st?(I expect we all agree this far)Now, what I have suggested is for Calc to format the cells with the chosen language setting WITHIN CALC. If the user saves in CSV format, the format is not saved, but the FORMATTING used in writing the data does depend on the language settings of the cells. Calc's internal representation of the number 1.23 should not concern me as a user, but it does concern me if it is written as 1.23 or 1,23 when I choose to write the data as a CSV file. I can make this choice by formatting the cell in Calc with a suitable language settign.As it is, I can choose "English" when loading the CSV file into Calc. But my choice of "English" is forgotten after the loading, so if I save the file then my standard language format is assumed. I am suggesting Calc to remember my choice by formatting the cells with the language from loading. In that way, data will be written with the assumptions from the language chosen at loading, enhancing the probability that the format is correct. Put another way: Enhancing the probability that opening a CSV file and then writing the same data to a CSV file will produce identical files.Yes, writing in CSV format is risky unless you know what you are doing (and even then). But I am not aware of any cases where the suggested enhancement could make it LESS likely that the files were identical. If the user does not make any choice of language when loading the file, then it will be loaded with the user's standard language, and the cells will be formatted with that language.PS: Thanks for the links on reading CSV files.--Lars JI need clarification here.The title of this issue is Choice of Decimal Point when exporting/saving .csv files. It is not about saving .ods or .xls or other formats. saving .csv.My sense of the initial explanation is that this mattered for round-tripping .csv in and then out of OpenOffice. Is this still the essential case?I am concerned that too much is being piggy-backed onto what is a fairly straightforward issue, however it is handled.(In reply to orcmid from)I think the original description andare very clear. Can we leave that as the essence of the enhancement request?(In reply to orcmid from)Also, the latest comment from Lars, #7 seems to reaffirm the case.(In reply to orcmid from)Talking for myself: Yes, the essential case is for round-tripping .csv in and then out of OpenOffice, and retaining the decimal point of the original.Ideally, the read and written .csv file should be identical if no chances are made. This will be very hard to guarantee, but my suggestion for enhancement would (as I see it) retain the decimal point of the original AND have the positive side effect that dates are would also be more likely to retain their format, since they would be written with the same language assumptions as they were read with.--Lars J

As expected the contents of new merged cells takes the format of column A cells.It helps to know some more about merge cell process. As the message box tells, there will not be a real merging of A1 and B1. In fact size of A1 will be increased so that it will cover old cell B1. And if you click [Yes] in Message box, contents of B1 will be transferred to now double width A1.This knowledge also explains why Merging B1:C1 will not show Style "demo" of C1 in new merged cell.

It's neither intended nor expected. Copy (^c) cell B1 and paste it (^v) to another cell, say B3 or C3, currently default-formatted: the copy does not 'simply take the format of the target cell'; instead, the B1 format overrides the default format.The same thing happens in Writer: if one pastes a string into an empty paragraph, the string format overrides the empty-paragraph style.(In reply to TAB from)(a) Your examples do not match with things happening when you merge cells, so your argumentation is wrong. If you do things completely different it's expected that the result might be different.(b) The message appearing tells that the merge process will hide some cells and that the contents of those cells what will be hidden can be moved into the first cell A1 (in my first example). (c) "Move" from (b) sounds very similar to 'For B1: <control+c> -> click A1 -> <f2> -> control+v - <Enter>', and the result in A1 proceeding so is the same or at least very similar to the result after merge.(d) of course the behavior is unexpected from point of view of an naive approach, and it is reasonable tho think about a function doing things more intuitive, some new feature SMARTMERGE, results some closer to the cell merge function of Writer But that is something different from a bugfix.

With office-type documents, and this feature,it should act as if each time one closes the document, it's as if the documentwas "checked in", with the timestamp rev#.@positivek: I'm not sure if I understand your problem. Let me describe how thefeature is meant to work:Each time when the document is closed and *if it is modified at that time* theuser will be asked if the document shall be saved. If the user agrees and theCheckbox for "save version on close" is checked, the document is saved alongwith a copy of the current state. Next time when the document is opened, it willopen the last version (I assume that this is what you call "trunk")."Always save a version when closing" is surely not what a user wants. But "onlysave a version when the document is modified" also surely isn't also. What aboutthe following: If the document has been modified in the last editing session and it is closed,ask for saving a version, regardless if the document is still modified or not?***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***This is not intuitive. This should be changed. No person in their right mindworks on a document without saving in increments. Or no smart person does. Thisfeature has no use, doesn't do what the words mean, and either should be removedor changed. My fault for assuming it was working i.e. Always save version onclosing? Checked = yes. Therefor on closing the version should be saved. Simplequestion statement, however what you saying is not that. Based on what yoursaying is how it works the question statement should be.If you haven't saved, and are closing the document do you want a version saved?imho: if the file has changed from it's opening saved time stamp, then on exitthe current version should be saved. This is how I thought it was working. Ifthe time stamp thing isn't possible, then if the box is checked, it should askon EVERY close.I agree that this feature is not intuitive. But how to make it better?IMHO versions should be created explicitly, every "automatic" procedure as thecurrent one is doomed to fail as it either creates too much or too few versions.Perhaps a good idea is to add a "create version" menu entry. We also could change the current feature so that in case it's active, a newversion is created when the file is closed if the file had been modified in thecurrent editing session, *even if the file had been saved already*.If I have this box ticked. It should ask if I want a version saved every time Iclose the document. Simple, and then is doing what it says. Sure it would be fabulous if it only asked if I made a change, but I don't thinkthat is necessary, and that could be an enhancement. That it did actually askeach and every time the document was closing would be following the questionstatement, and performing a task based on that question statement. I don't think this is an enhancement. I feel this is a necessary fix. This needsto be changed so on every close a version is saved OR it asks if I want aversion saved. It would then matche the question statement. Anyone who hasticked that box is making a decision that versions are important and should bemaintained. I'd rather have versions showing no change, then no version at all,which I'm sure the majority or users are experiencing at the moment. I've mademultiple changes to documents I have this box ticked on. Believing it was doingwhat it said. Saving a version on close. I have no versions other then the mostcurrent one. Have 5 versions 2 of them with no change would be better then whatI have 1 version, and no sense of what the original document was.Agreet. This need to be fix. Or at least need to modify explanation in help where this feature described as:"If you have made changes to your document, OpenOffice automatically saves a new version when you close the document."For the record, the functionality used to be broken in OpenOffice 4.1.0 (and a few earlier versions) and was fixed by hanya in.This fixes the "Close with unsaved changes" scenario and aligns the behavior with the documentation (that now explicitly states that "Always save a version on closing" only applies to the "Close with unsaved changes" scenario).The "manually save, then close" scenario is an enhancement that came up for discussion inbut it's better described here, especially inabove. So this should be discussed here.

id=7553	OpenOffice.org Writer may execute an invalid operation when loading somedocuments containing reference to an Internet URL if the Internet connection isnot available at the time(or having incorrectly set Option\Internet\Proxy settings).Windows2000 issuses a dialog saying "The instruction at '0x035c6f15' referencedmemory at '0x00000000'. The memory could not be 'read'" and terminates OOo Writer.This doesn't occur to all documents containing Internet reference. And itdoesn't happen every time (but frequently) opening the document that had issuedthis error. When testing, I found if the error occurs, Windows2000 seems alwayscomplaining the same instruction address mentioned above.One more problem is, if the Internet connection is very slow, it takes toolong(minutes) to load the document before OOo recovers from "freezing" when loading. CreatedSampleDoc.sxw is a document (in Chinese_cn) that frequently causes the fatal error.I have successfully replicated the bug report by using the file attached. I opened the file online, it has been opened but slowly (about 3minutes, I use dial up). Then I went off line, and the file cannot be opened.On an XP using OOo 1.1 Beta2, this document crashed Writer whenan internet connection is open, but doesn't crashes Writer whenan internet connection is not open.New per comments From2002-09-16 12:10 PDTand From maxkennedy 2003-06-25 23:35 PDTI tried to reproduce the problem with 1.1Beta2 verman version WIN98SE1. save attached testfile 2. open file in explorer by double click with 1.1Beta2 during an open ADSL internet connection expected: file should be opened actual: more or less no load from internet, WRITER hangs, must be closed with task manager.Questions:- All systems?RainerReassigned to Ã‰ric.ES->All: yes it is platform independantES->ABI: AFAIK this problem has been partly fixed in cws_abi3.

Nothing, which Ican influence (maybe someone in the application teams can). Otherwise,where do you get your numbers from? Is there any specification,against which you decide that the time is too long, or is it personalfeeling only?Rainer -> ABIHi, die you read that that is not a general time problem but somethingreproducible with the testfile? It should be tested if the same file with images local on harddisk orembedded would be faster. But before I do all that work question ->ES : how sure are are you with "partly fixed in cws_abi3"?Might be more useful to test example with that version. RainerSorry, I thought this was refering to another issue.ES->BH: we must find a way to manage the time out in OOo when linkedcontents exist in a document, for instance:- Timeout earlier when contents are not available- Allow the user to break the retrive process but load the documentHello Kay, could you please take over this bug.

Thank you.Set to framework as it concerns all applications.Sorry Kai, your name ends with "i". :)seems to be related to fileobj.cxxMIB->ES: What are we discussing currently?a) a specific issue (crash) with a specific file, that is reproducable?b) a feature enhancement that allows OOo to specify the timeout for HTTPconnerctions or something like this?c) something else?ES->MIB: I can't reproduce the original report that tells about a *crash*.I can reproduce the extreme slow loading time (about 5 minutes) of the documentwhen:- no proxies are set or- the connection is slow- the graphics do not exist at the given addresse.So it's a performance bug (thus I changed the title)MIB: It is a well known issue that OOo is loading images synchronously. For mypoint of view, that's okay, because SO is not a web browser, but an HTML editor.Therfor it is valid to assume that the images contained in the document thatshould be edited are loadable. An improvement of cause would be possible.Since the issue occurs only under certain circumstances, P4/Office later seemsto be more appropriate.I agree with MIB.file attached tocontains single linked image. if internet connection is not available 1.1.2 opens slowly, but then allows to edit docuemnt etc. 680m47 hangs when docuemnt is loaded. should i open a new issue or is this supposed to be handled by this one ?-> richlv: yes it is handled by this one. No need to open another issue.->MIB/AMA: the fact that OOo is not a web browser does not justify the notacceptable loading time of documents with linked content when no Internetconnection is available.- save the front page of Yahoo.com localy (without graphics)- open it in OOo after having turned the proxy settings off-> it lasts 4 (four!) minutes before one can edit anything in the document oreven do something with OOo.This is not acceptable. Every user (not aware about this conceptual bug) wouldhave killed OOo after, let's say, 40sec, believing OOo is hanging and eventuallycausing a data loss.Microsoft Word is not either a Web browser but it loads the same document (andthe document is then editable) in a couple of sseconds.Thus I raise prio to P3 (though I really think it would be worth a P2)***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***If src680m46 was able to load a document, but src680m47 isn't then this does notmatch the current issue that is only about pewrformce.Please subimit a new issue to the sfx team.I asked richlv to detail the problem in the other issue.Reassigning to you.ES->BH: I just rewrite my statement from last year (nov. 03):we must find a way to manage the time out in OOo when linkedcontents exist in a document, for instance:- Timeout earlier when contents are not available- Allow the user to break the retrive process but load the documentIn other words:- we have to see if this can enter in a PCD for OOo 3.0- then build an I-Team (framework) to design an acceptable behaviourReset to Enhancement***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***I can still confirm this problem exists with OOo 1.9.118 on Windows and OOo1.9.125 (Novell edition) on SUSE Linux 9.3.Honoustly I think this is a very grave bug which should be fixed for OOo 2.0.Think of the following scenario: You have a bunch of OpenDocument files on aserver in your corporate network which contain references to images on a serverin your network. Then the address of the referenced server changes. Of courseyou now have to open the documents to correct the references, but OOo simplyhangs and sometimes even crashes when opening the documents. Some documents takeas much as much 10 minutes to open, where the entire OOo interface is frozen for10 minutes. Sometimes OOo just keeps hanging, at which point you just kill itafter 15 minutes of being frozen.But it's not just documents with references which can trigger this behavior. Ifyou just open a new document and go to Insert => Picture => From File... and youenter an HTTP URL to a server on an unreachable network*, OOo just hangs, andkeeps hanging. (Again, I killed it after 15 minutes of hanging). 15 minutes isreally too much for a single HTTP timeout, so it can't be attributed to that alone.Seriously, this is not just an enhancement request, this is a very grave bug.OOo really should fetch external references asynchronously and should not hang(forever?) when trying to fetch non-existing references.*) To test: if you're on a 192.168.0.* network, just try referencing a192.168.1.* address, provided there's no gateway to route to 192.168.1.*addresses. This was tested on Linux, I don't know if the specifics differbetween platforms.***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***IMHO it is quite important that OOo informs the user of operations when isloading external files:Having my OOo (version 2.0, w/winXP) frozed i thought it crashed and that mydocument was dead, and spent time manually recovering informations from"contents.xml". (by chance, doing so, i found an image's URL, and understood theproblem). One could have spent many many hours doing such a recovery work,without thinking that switching off his firewall will solve the problem!!. Most users won't wait 10 minutes: More thane 2 minutes whith a frozenprogression bar is understood as a crash by the user and "solved" by a Ctrl-Alt-Del!PROPOSITION: A good part of a solution would be to add a log-line (similar tonetscape's) telling the user what is going on. Either or not replacing theprogression bar (and having mini-progression after the message (dots...).- "opening file..." (this is so quick that will not disturb anybody)- "uncompressing file xxxxxxxx.odt"- "loading files whaterver1",- "loading files whaterver2",- "interpreting and formatting document"- "loading external image href="- "..."When it freezes (or takes a little too long), the last log line will stay,becoming a way for the user to understand which particular action is so long tocomplete, and it'll give him a chance to understand without using pkzip and atext editor..And when it doesn't freezes, the user probabely won't even see that small linesaying incomprehensible things changing too quickly.(Loglines can be added to a log-file, making a debug action possible after the"crash").Hoping it can help...Happens to me as well.

The freeze is hazardous: - I can still move the window, but now updates (strange screen drawings) - If I kill the window (Ctrl+Alt+Esc) a zombie process keeps running so unskilled users cannot start OOo any more!Background: Debian Sarge + OOo 2.3 deb packages, Proxy used (WPAC autoconf).(KDE system settings are valid). 100% reproducable.

The problem is the same.The document opens and all the the pages are there except that from around page 267 and onwards all the pages are blank. I noticed how the memory load during import increased up to a certain point until a certain ceiling. This observation led me to play around with the OOO memory settings (Tools-> Options-> Openoffice.org-> Memory-> Graphics cache).I changed the default values up to the following:Use for Openofffice.org = 256MBMemory per Object =1,0 MBWith these settings I got ~100 pages more imported correctly so pages 1-370 imported correctly and the rest was blank.I would like if you could take over and work on this, as we are about to promulgate the same law text again very soon and so we will face the problem converting this document again in production.sba -> lohals: Thank you for your investigation and the hint with the graphic cache. Re-assigning this issue to me.

To me, this seems to be not a filter issue but a limitation of the current "internal memory handling". Please proceed.

A good way to get rid of the message.e) this is a "marketing push" because it appears even if there is no loss of information; it alerts the user needlessly and will be a source of trouble in a professional environment (where only the responsible for computer systems should decide when to update)For these reasons, this message should be suppressed on 2.4.1.Only in the case where a document contains features not recognised by the current version, could a warning message be issued.

Mozilla and Netscape work fine. Regular http seems to work fine, but not https. I have duplicated this issue and have seen a ton of posts on this. I have tried OOo 1.1.0 and the new 1.1.1.Scenerio: Place a .doc file on a http webserver. Try opening it via http link with IE. (of course only OOo is installed and IE knows to use OOo to open the doc). You should succeed in opening the doc.Now enable https on that webserver and try the same thing. You will recieve a grey screen with an error that pops up about "API CALL EXITED ABNORMALLY". It appears to me that SSL is not supported with OOo and IE. Can anyone confirm or anyone have any additional info?utomo > jgriffis123 the https issue is different to this.

id=112795	Steps to reproduce: 1. start impress 2. open navigator 3. dock it to the right of the right pane 4. quit impress 5. start writer 6. open styles and formatting 7. move it on top of the navigator to be docked (it should show as docked over the navigator) 8. grab the styles and formatting dock and move it down to dock it under the navigator 9. quit writer10. start writer11. the docks are side by side with the styles and formatting on the leftThe trouble is all applications have common configuration for the docks, sothere are docks that are not visible in some applications (like impress's rightpane in writer). These are still present in the array of docks, but their pWinmember is NULL. So, in this case, the styles and formatting dock gets insertedto the dock array _after_ the (null) right pane. The attached patch changesbehaviour of SfxSplitWindow::InsertWindow to insert a new dock before all nulldocks preceding the found insertion position. Createdlike thisThanks for the patch, I will have a lookset target to 3.x since not release relevant for 3.4 release.The patch required some minor adjustments.I also translated some debug messages while here.Sending sfx2/source/dialog/splitwin.cxxTransmitting file data .Committed.Thank you!1. start impress2. open navigator3. dock it to the right of the right pane Crash.Createdpatch to revert all changes(In reply to)please revert all changes. It crashes AOO when docking any docking window by moving the window on the docking area (docking by holding down the Ctrl key, double-click a vacant area in the window, is not broken).Thank you Ariel!Feel free to revert it ... I have not been doing OO related stuff lately and I seem to have problems with subversion lately anyways.@ArielPlease keep the english comments. Nobody will understand the german one ;-)No crash for me on Mac OS X Intel (Tiger 10.4)I can dock, undock, dock undock the navigator everywhere.Hi Eric;The obvious question .. If we revert this change do you have issues docking in OS X?(In reply to)A crash dump, if you can get one, would be good.The patch was reverted inby arielch.I do prefer to avoid the crash so this was well done.The German comments are back too but quite honestly the translatorthat someone ran didn't do a good job there.I'm adding this comment to all open issues with Issue Type == PATCH. We have 220 such issues, many of them quite old. I apologize for that. We need your help in prioritizing which patches should be integrated into our next release, Apache OpenOffice 4.0.If you have submitted a patch and think it is applicable for AOO 4.0, please respond with a comment to let us know.On the other hand, if the patch is no longer relevant, please let us know that as well.If you have any general questions or want to discuss this further, please send a note to our dev mailing list:Thanks!-Rob
id=108458	Open the attached document. It contains one annotation but it is hidden. HoweverOOo still shows the annotation area to the right of the document and adjusts thezoom factor accordingly. Ideally the annotation area should not be present atall if no annotations are visible. If that is not possible, at least adjust thezoom factor as if it were not there, so that it is scrolled out of view whenopening the document. CreatedAll annotations are hidden, but the annotation are remains an ugly stripe to the right of the document.It must be determined if there are still non-hidden comments in the document. Ithink, that this is not implemented yet.@christophnoack: should the sidepane be hidden if there are comments, but onlyhidden ones?@mod: I don't get it :-) The feature of "hidden notes" isn't implemented inWriter, is it? If not, is this a feature available in the Oasis specification? Bye!yes, it is implemented. Select the anchor(or characters around it)and set thecharacter format to hidden, and you will not see the note anymore. (Note: thisis different from some earlier prototype, where you could select the popupbutton and select "Hide Note")The question here is: if all notes are hidden(in the sample document there isonly one note, which is hidden), should we show the sidebar or not@mod: The basic point is whether the user wants to know if there are any notesin the document. I think this is a 50/50 decision here, since some users maystill want to know that there are notes in the document (e.g. when sending themto other people; currently still shown in the Navigator) or if they want to hideeverything because it disturbs them during work (no problem, since the side panecan easily been deactivated in an editable document).If we would have the Document Check I proposed, I would go for hiding the sidepane per default. But without this functionality and with regard to ourdecisions so far (being very cautious with regard to hidden information) wemight keep it. Finally, I don't know real _reasons_ to go for this/that. Thebest solution so far would even be to mark the sidepane with something like"Document contains hidden notes" to make clear why it is shown. As you may havenoticed, completely different from what has been proposed initially :-)ok, I guess no strong points for either one and just a matter of taste. If wechange it, I'm sure people will complain that they missed a comment. Worth anoption? I guess not!-> resolved wontfixIf anything new comes up, we can always reopenclosingI don't buy the "people will complain that they missed a comment" argument. Whenthe document creator has hidden a comment, then the comment is obviously notmeant for consumption by receivers of the document who are not told specificallyabout it. Why else would he have hidden the comment?You are thinking about techies. Those can use the navigator to find all comments.About not being worth an option. That's a good point, but we already have anoption for it that is perfectly applicable. It's the option to show hidden text.Obviously this should make the side pane with the comments re-appear because itmakes the text the comments are attached to appear. This further eliminates yourargument that people could be bothered by missing a comment. There is noindication that there is any hidden text in a document unless you decide to turnon the option to show it. So far, no one has complained. I don't see howcomments should be different from the main text. And if I may remind you, beforethe side pane was introduced, comments were exactly like text. The little boxesdisappeared completely when the text was invisible, unless showing hidden textwas enabled. All I want is to have the old behaviour back. If it was okay backthen, it's okay now.We have to scenarios where hidden comments come into play. The first one is whenparts of a document are hidden/unhidden on demand (through an interactiveextension) and comments related to hidden text are not supposed to be read(because they don't apply). The second are comments that contain data only forconsumption by our extension.In both cases I don't want the user experience to suffer by a sub-optimal zoomfactor and an empty side panel that will confuse ordinary users (who wonder ifthis is a graphic bug and they should be seeing something there), but this iswhat OOo currently does.@christophnoack: makes sense to me, do you agree?@mod: As I already said, it seems to be a 50/50 decision. So we don't doadditional harm when changing it - if you like. But before you start and justfor clarification: This should then also work for a) viewing hidden text withviewing Non-printing Characters activated, b) un-hiding text via default format,c) changing hidden status via styles. What I don't know at the moment: What willhappen if the user explicitly activates View -- Notes (which is an activeelement). Then, the user definitively wants to see the notes. Any ideas? @mux2005: If you buy it or not ;-) Comments are often used to just put togethersome rough thoughts which might not be too kind, well formulated, ... Incontrast, people are more aware of the main text to be viewable by others. Thatis one of the basic principles for the design of the notes.Bye, Christoph@christophnoack:As I've said, all I want is the old pre-sidebar behaviour back with respect toinvisibility. If there are any ambiguities, just do what OOo 2.x did in the samesituation.

Any news about this issue?Performance penalty with temp files is huge, and there is no workaround.As target points the issue is planned to be solved in one of the future releasesof 3.x branch. Currently there are no resources to get it in 3.1.By the way, the workaround is to use OOo format.Well, after fix ofload time is better but still long.Just tested with OOo-dev m50 on Linux.It seems that solution in 101219 is not perfect: temp files ARE created, butthen erased almost immediately. Only 4 of them left after the file opens completely.Close document perf. is great - it's no longer need to erase thousands of temps!Maybe some streams have been opened with the requirement to be seekable? In thiscase we have to create a temp file. Quite often this happens when SvStreams areused as they are always seekable.mav->pmike: I must confess I do not quite understand the idea of your comment.The sentences like "better but still long" and "is not perfect" can not betreated as a constructive critic. Actually they could be used for anyperformance improvement.The only concrete sentence there is that the temporary files are still created,but it is intended so, please read the description of theone moretime. The memory is used only for small streams, so the temporary files arestill created for big streams. It is a compromise between performance and memoryusage.mav->mba: The streams are inserted to the storage during the import from MSformat currently ( this bug is actually about avoiding such insertion ), asresult a temporary medium is necessary. So for the big streams the temporaryfiles are still used.After this bug is fixed no temporary medium ( either memory or file ) should beused for the object stream until it is changed. The stream should be read fromthe imported document if possible.Here we have another problem, the whole document has to be copied in this case,to be sure that in case of network outage and etc. the document contents arestill available.

In my opinion, either this issue orshould be reopened, becausethere is INCONSISTENT behavior, not just undesired behavior. OOo sometimesupdates cell references in conditional formatting properly, and sometimes doesnot, depending on the situation. If references are not to be updated, then theyshould NEVER be updated instead of being updated in certain situations and notothers.This is aside from the observation that a large number of users have viewed thelack of updating as a bug and reported it as such, making WONTFIX a less thandesireable solution.If you like, I can open a second issue about the inconsistent behavior, or I canrepoen this issue. If I don't receive any comments I will reopen this issuerather than create a new issue.It's consistent with named ranges, after which it was modeled.

Note that when absolute referencingis used, the cell references already update properly (see). Notealso that absolute referencing for the cell coordinates but relative referencingfor the SHEET name only in the cell reference will break updating. Please seefor a more complete description of the problem.Added ms_interoperability keyword, as this issue can break importedfunctionality of Excel spreadsheets if the user is not careful.targetI can confirm the issue with absolute references, where no sheet name is used(for instance, using $C$1 instead of $Sheet1.$C$1).

When?This needs more emphasis than merely an "ENHANCEMENT".Any chance to get this fixed for 3.1?It is no enhancement. It is a real bug.Could you at least define a specific target milestone? Tis BUG has been knownover 7 years now, and it is a basic one (happens with native open officedocuments, not only with Excel documents). This is really annoying.I've been waiting for more than a year now and the bug was filed 2002!This bug is classified as an enhancement due to that it behaves according to themodelling. The Conditional formating FEATURE is buggy and that the reason is anincorrect modelling still makes it a bug, not an enhancement. An example of an enhancement is to extend then number of conditions per cellfrom 3 to 7, nowdays supported by Excel. I propose that this is introduced atthe same time but the most urgent request is to fix the bug itself.Myself I filed a bug #235602 in Launchpad a year agoThe least I can expect is that this bug is changed from enhancement to betreated as what it is, i.e. a bug. Moreover I expect a milestone to be set. I'mwaiting and stuck in Excel due to this annoying bug.This should be considered a bug. I make extensive use of conditional formatting, and doing so in Open Office stops any further activity on the spreadsheet because any row / coloumn changes (add / delete) immediately breaks all conditional formatting, and is not acceptable.If you use relative references in your conditional formatting, you can't add/delete a row/coloumn that moves your formatted cell. If you use absolute references, you cannot add/delete a row/coloumn that will move your referenced cell.This is the single most important reason I can't use OpenOffice, and I can't recommend it in this condition. It's that serious of a bug. I use conditional formatting to quickly visualise the state of the data and it helps me prevent any editing errors, for example. But I cannot do it using OpenOffice, because once I design the conditional formatting functions, the document is pretty much fixed.It is incredible a basic bug like that can be ignored for so many years. Itsimply prevents me from using openoffice. Conditional Formatting is absolutelykey for spreadsheets used as dashboards and cockpits. Visual dashboards is oneof the main reasons for people to buy Excel. And for sure people that builddashboards add rows periodically. The worst part is the problem involves aformula that is embedded in a dialog box and therefore the old nice"find-replace" does not work here. I cannot see any way to work with it, except if I get back to Excel, insert ahundred of rows, and then send it back to openoffice. But if I do so, why shouldI come back to openoffice? I believe this kind of question is exactly the kindof question MS loves.Yes, incredible. 7.5 years. I do not believe this will be fixed ever. Do not getme wrong, I have bought several versions of StarOffice, but on the other hand,80,- for MS Home and Student is not so much either.Unbelievable! If OO.o didn't plan to fix it since 7.5 years ago, please justclose this issue, or please do a warning message to all users who TRUST OO.o. Ithink the latter is much easier to be carried out.Any of you are more than welcome to submit a patch to fix this. After 7.5 yearsno one has submitted a patch & people still expect others to fix it for them... To me that's also unbelievable.Maybe this is a problem of opensource software. You can never expect anything.On the other hand, this software is sold as StarOffice, and considering thatExcel has handled conditional formatting correctly forever, as paying customeryou would expect that such rather basic functionality will be fixed sometime inStarOffice as well (without doing it yourself).I realize the behavior of this function is not working as people expect. Thisfeature should probably be marked as "incomplete" (if possible), and theOpenOffice documentation updated to explain that the desired behavior ofabsolute addressing with reference to conditionally formatted cells duringinsert/delete/move/copy events is broken, and may never get fixed.This way, people like me who spent too much time trying to make it work in apractical application have a chance to learn it doesn't work when we read thatdocumentation (which is the first place people like me look for help).I wish I could program, and fix this behavior for everyone. Furthermore, I wishI had unlimited amount of money, and could afford to pay someone to delve intothe code and fix this behavior.I wonder if this would be squashed any faster if a case of beer was offered tothe lone coder that fixes this.This is a bug. I, too, can't do the programming but wish I could.There could be a basic fault in the algorithms for conditional formatting which needs to be addressed.It is similar to(transfer from .xls files) which makes .xls files incompatible with Ooo with respect to conditional formatIf wo cells are linked by formula, and one moves with respect to another, we correctly update the formula.Can the same methods be used to update conditional formulae?
id=73908	So, it would be altogether more pleasant if instead of having to constructstrings from Ascii (with RTL_CONSTASCII_USTRINGPARAM) we could create anin-line, (and static) rtl_[u]String object, that is in .rodata - hence sharedacross all processes, and tagged as 'static' thus, not requiring ref-counting(cf. #73907#)This can be done (for gcc at least) nice & conditionally & source compatibly [Kay's neat idea ]:/* force expansion */#define RTL_CONSTASCII_USTRINGPARAM_STR( constAsciiStr ) L##constAsciiStr/* emit in-line static .rodata rtl_uString */#define RTL_CONSTASCII_USTRINGPARAM( constAsciiStr ) \ ((rtl_uString *)(&((const struct { sal_Int32 r; sal_Int32 l; const wchar_tb[sizeof(constAsciiStr)]; } ) { (1<<30)+1, sizeof(constAsciiStr)-1,RTL_CONSTASCII_USTRINGPARAM_STR(constAsciiStr) }))), SAL_NO_ACQUIRE committed to salstrintern, ommitting the 'string.hxx' variant, since it causesgrief with (eg.) OStringBuffer.append(), and/or rtl_str_compareWithLength (etc.etc.) where people used the relevant CONSTASCII macro in the past. Thoughchanges may be somewhat minimal to clean all callers, at least some work wouldbe needed.Of course, this helps find some wonderful pieces of code around the place: eg.the mercifully unused ;-)--- rdbmaker/inc/codemaker/global.hxx+++ rdbmaker/inc/codemaker/global.hxx@@ -94,10 +94,10 @@ sal_Bool fileExists(const ::rtl::OString sal_Bool checkFileContent(const ::rtl::OString& targetFileName, const::rtl::OString& tmpFileName); const ::rtl::OString inGlobalSet(const ::rtl::OUString & r);-inline const ::rtl::OString inGlobalSet(sal_Char* p)-{- return inGlobalSet( ::rtl::OUString( RTL_CONSTASCII_USTRINGPARAM(p) ) );-};-)But wchar_t is often 32 bit, not 16 bit as we would need it. What am I missing?sb: you're missing the solenv/inc/ patch:CFLAGS+=-fshort-wchar -DRTL_INLINE_STRINGSCFLAGSCXX+=-fshort-wchar -DRTL_INLINE_STRINGS:-) and the fact that this is a source-transparent optimisation we turn onconditionally only where it works.Strictly speaking, this breaks a stable API, as RTL_CONSTASCII_USTRINGPARAM isdocumented to "Supply an ASCII string literal together with its length and textencoding." ;)Alternative would be, to introduce a new macro with the desired spec. and toadapt all (possible) locations of RTL_CONSTASCII_USTRINGPARAM ....IMHO, the risk is relatively low, so we might want to take it ... ;-)1 -fshort-wchar: Somewhat thin ice. At least libstd++ and libstlport shippedwith OOo export wchar_t-infected C++ functionality. You can only hope thatnobody uses it. And libstlport is a public part of URE, so it should not changeincompatibly, so we should not build it with -fshort-wchar.2 "IMHO, the risk is relatively low" I think so too (hence the smiley). However, the documentation of RTL_CONSTASCII_USTRINGPARAM should be changed tostate that it expands to an argument list suitable for a call to exactly one ofthe rtl::OUString constructors.2. wrt. the risk, I'm building up a patch of the changes necessary around theplace - and it seems, they are becoming more substantial, which is a problem.Particularly in places where an attempt has been made to optimise string usagealready - eg. 'xmloff' constructs are used that make this harder.What might be better would be to use a macro that had control over the OUStringconstruction too [ and resign ourselves to more 'global' OUStrings (?) ], ie.RTL_USTRING_LITERAL("foo") -> either OUString("foo", sizeof("foo")-1, ASCII), orOUString(mangled_macro("foo"), SAL_NO_ACQUIRE)That way perhaps we would have more joy, and it'd be more compatible; it'd alsohave the merit of being rather shorter than the existing OUString(RTL_VERY_LONG_NAME_INDEED ("foo")) - what do you think ?Hokay - I'm backing this out of the CWS - for several reasons:* it doesn't work as is: + We really need a macro (eg.) RTL_USTRING_LITERAL(a) that will include the OUString() creation, then use that in hot-spots.* it doesn't save that much memory: + much of the string duplication I've measured is removed by using 'intern' anyway, worse using it will increase the size of the binaries by more than the heap we will save, since at a given time most strings are not instantiated on the heap.* shlib unloading (normal lifecycle problem) + if we pass references to .rodata static strings around the app, then we can never unload that library again, ergo we should do this sparingly where we can prove there is a useful win I think.And of course, I don't want the problems to block the 'intern' feature gettingintegrated :-)Createdpatch for posterityAs an aside new C++ standard will have new string literals of...u8"UTF-8 string."u"UTF-16 string."U"UTF-32 string."

Also observe that the note is now displayed at row 49 with a long arrow to cell A61. The problem gets worse with a longer spreadsheet. Try the same thing with cell A300 and you will find the arrow points to cell A306 with the note displayed at row 258. By resetting the height to whatever value it was when you entered the notes the view is restored but this means that if you use notes in a spreadsheet that you can never change the row height.Please let me know if these detailed instructions are sufficient for you to duplicate this problem on your computer. If not I will try and offer additional help. Thank you.There are several related issues (listed below), where the inserted Note is notdisplayed in the expected position after some modification to the spreadsheet.Position of Note is not adjusted when...- Insufficient room on right-hand side of window ();- Columns / rows are hidden (ie. size=0) ();- Split separation inserted for row / column ();- Row (/Column?) size is changed ().Regards,AndrewConfirmed with OOo 680m152, WinXP SP2.Recreated issue as described by 'planoduncan' (thanks for the detailed description).AndrewThe reason I was unable to reproduce this bug at first, is that the displacementof the arrow is proportional to the row number. In other words, trying theprocedure with a Note at Row 3 the effect is not visible, whereas for a Note atRow 236 the arrow is clearly displaced. (Please see attached test case document).The displacement of the Note arrow occurs when shrinking or expanding rowheights, as shown in the attached screenshot ('61253NoteArrow.png'). However, onsaving the document and reopening it, the position of the arrow is now correct.The more serious problem is that the actual position of the Note is not updated.This is best shown with the attached screenshot '61253NotePosition.png', takenat ~20% zoom.

Sometimes,however, you want to work on a document you have on a USB flash drive orsomething and need the full font embedded to do the work.OpenOffice.org could potentially put icons next to open fonts, if you could finda way to embed license information in them. GPL fonts have been questioned asto if they're legally dangerous (do you have to GPL your document?), PD fontsare awesome, CC-by-sa is fine too, as well as GPL with font clause. For theincredibly semantic, this would alert them to which fonts were free and open andwhich were locked down. Non-iconed ones would be of unknown (and assumedclosed) licensing.I am doing a news letter that needs to be avaliable in both word and pdf format. I can get the correct fonts if I export it as pdf. but creating the word document does not save the fonts. It is the above issue.This format has been used for years under MS Publisher, but I have no desire to go back to MS. Both Scribus and OpenOffice create a good PDF document but I need the word version also.Embedded fonts are very importent when archiveing documents, when collaborateingwith other people and mailing documents to preserve layout. Retreaving documentsfrom a backup or archive can be a nightmare if the fonts have changed or are gone.1. Sorry for my bad English :)2. IMHO fonts embedding should be a main task for next major release ofOpenOffice. Or one of main tasks :)3. Because of problem is very complex and difficult but also is very important -i think a "half-solution" can be implemented for the first time. We can have anoption "attach font files to the document". It will copy all used font filesinto document archive subdirectory, but will not use this files. This option canprevent a big part of "archives restoring nightmare". Also, users in futurealways will know: if they do not have some font for document - they can open thedocument as usual ZIP archive and get needed fonts. Not all fonts can beinstalled in all OSes, but IMHO this be better that nothing. Also, this cansoften licensions problems: we can say distribute fonts in document, but notfully compile fonts with document. Or we can't - i am not an jurist :-)I hope this feature will never be implemented, because it would be a legalnightmare for whatever user.Here:you can find a "Font copyright for dummies" document made by an independentorganization like UNESCO that explains in few words how difficult would be,legally speaking, to manage documents with proprietary fonts embedded.There would be issues not only for the original creator of the document, but forthe authors of *derivative* works too, if they won't know which font is embeddedunder which license.In the professional world of press, publishing, journalism and in any case inwhich a document will have derivative elaborations, such a feature may causeunknown liabilities for breaching of font licensing terms both for the originalauthor and other people/organization who will manage a specific document.And, IMVHO, a warning window for the original author that embeds fonts isn'tenough to avoid problems for other people who use the document for other (largescale, on line, administrative, commercial) purposes.Any analysis about the implementation of this feature should include more consthan pros.Due to the long inactivity of this issue and valid concerns of legalimplecations I will close this issueclosingwhat is happened? You must reopen issue! take in mind legality or non-legalitydoes not apply to OpenOffice, but only to end user. you know that some peoplesold by micro$oft can post interested comments in order to stop OpenOfficeprogress. so, font embedding is very important for effective interoperability,otherwise people still using Word. Do you want this? people still usingmicro$oft Word instead of OpenOffice? it is not legality issue. micro$oft wordembed usually fonts, so embedding is fully legal, why, then, people usingOpenOffice must have lesser features? a kind of masochism?Embedding fonts is legal if you have rights to do so. Please read "Adobe versusICT" U.S. sentence before commenting further.Ops... "Adobe versus ITC". Sorry for the mistake. :)interesting question: point of view on legality is wrong: I explain why: infact, OpenOffice, implementing a font embedding feature, does not breaks any lawor infringes copyright, because it does not embed nothing, only makes user ableto embed. the effective embedder is end user (I agree with other poster onthis). if end user breaks laws or copyright, He/She breaks, not openoffice,because I can have need of embedding an opensource (GPL licensed) font, so, asend user, I don't break any kind of law or copyright.If we feel unsure about the legal status and think it will be a legal nightmarefor the normal user to embed proprietary fonts, then let us start out safe byallowing the embedding of fonts we know are safe to embed.Though it would not make it as easy to use as Microsoft Word, it might justpromote people to use the free fonts.Personally I can live with a limited selection of fonts, but it is a really painthat I cannot be guaranteed that my document looks the same when I move it to asystem, that does not have the fonts.I agree with armandillo, its not an good idea that Openoffice tries to block theuse of embedded fonts. Today an enduser can embedd other copyrighted objects like pictures, sound andcopied text extracts. In these cases there is the endusers obligation to beobservant and make the right steps to follow his local copyright laws. I can'tsee any differens or other problems embedding fonts with several types ofenduser licens agreements than embedding other copyrighted objects. It's notrealistic that it is the software, Openoffice, that makes those decisions forthe enduser.Again, please read Adobe vs. ITC (AGFA) sentence before further commenting.It's exactly the same situation: Adobe had and has applications that embed fonts. They didn't win that trial because "effective embedder is end user", but because they (Adobe) had payed for rights to produce applications that embeds fonts.In this issue has already been suggested to get a license from AGFA for a specific technology in order to get a better MS Office compatibility. If that solution is a viable one, it may resolve all problems.Otherwise, if technically possible according to OpenDocument specifications, it would be good to enforce a *strict* respect for embedding bits included into fonts files.However, even if fonts have the "Editable" or "Installable" bit set, we still don't know nothing about its license.I have personally read "Cease and Desist" letters addressed to software developers and written for claims based on Section 1201(a) of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act because their software *may* be used to embed fonts that had the "No Embedding Allowed" bit set. And those developers used their software for *free* fonts embedding.I don't say a Cease and Desist letter is like a law or a sentence. Nevertheless, at least, it's surely a good chance to be called before a court to resolve the question. Does OOo *really* need this sort of "risk"?luctur: Please post a link to the sentence. I have searched for it withoutfinding it. I have a feeling it does not apply to any of the countries that doesnot have DMCA.From what you write, I still see it would cause no problems if OOo only allowsembedding of a specified list of fonts that are free for this purpose - even incountries with DMCA. Thereby it may not be used for other fonts.Is anyone on the OO team a lawyer or have professional legal background? I have contacted the kind people at EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) (), who do have lawyers on hand specifically to address these kinds of issues. I don't know if they have any better suggestions, but if the only reason for not implementing this CRITICAL feature is because of fear of legal ramifications, then it seems consulting lawyers who specialize in electronic intellectual property laws/rights, would be the best source to consult before completely giving up on some variant of an "embedded fonts" capability (such as the aforementioned partial functionality of somehow only allowing "open" fonts to be embedded). Please reconsider opening this feature for now, for consideration. I don't know if the EFF folks will take this on, or even be able to suggest any more than you have from the "Chilling Effect" of the "Adobe vs. ITC" and other cases. But it is certainly worth investigating before completely giving up on so critical a feature. This lacking component is a show-stopper feature for our magazine at the very least. And I can only imagine how many others are stuck, unable to fully utilize OO for similar reasons, and forced to either use MS/Adobe commercial products, or completely stuck because there is no alternative on their operating system (many of us use only Linux, BSD, Solaris, etc.), and have no alternative, and are being seriously impacted in trying to collaborate in the final stages of the zine.Thank you all for you great work and efforts, and please do not give up on this feature just yet.tange: you can search also Agfa vs. Adobe [404 F. Supp. 2d 1030 (N.D. Ill.2005)]. They sued each other several times on very similar topics. This sentenceis really more liberal and it may permit OOo to implement a font embeddingfeature even in the U.S.However, it has not prevented other corporations to start claims about the verysame question. For example, Storage Technology Corp. v. Custom HardwareEngineering & Consulting, Ltd [No. 02-12102-RWZ, 2006 WL 1766434 (D. Mass. June28, 2006)] and others. This is the "risk" I was talking about: unneeded trialsin a controversial law field.Then, there are other legal concerns related to users' work. For example, a fontthat has the "Allow embedding" bit set says nothing about its license.Example: Armadillo spoke about GPLed fonts. Let's say that such a font has thequoted above bit set and OOo embeds it into a document. If the font licensedoesn't includes the "GPL font exception"(explanation of the exceptionaka "ratio")*each* work derivated from that document and is content would become GPLed. So: you should know if a font has been embedded into a document, what licenserules it and if the embedder applied that license in the right way!And what about if you duplicate the document and then release your own copyunder Creative Commons or a proprietary copyright since *in the content* iswritten that you can apply such licenses?Is it a legal nightmare, isn't it?Same considerations can be done for proprietary fonts EULA and your own documents.Sincerely, embedding fonts is a *risky* activity, legally speaking. You shouldhave a windows that pops up every time someone opens a document and warns "Afont has been embedded under license XYZ"...And trials about fonts embedding are not so uncommon. And even if you win them,they have a *cost*, in time and money. Recently, even in my country, Italy,Business Software Association started a campaign against "font piracy".Implementing this feature would make me wonder if I'm a "pirate" just becausesomeone, somewhere, has embedded a font in a document that I have to edit. IMO,there would be too much troubles.Making this feature an option for those professionals who really need it? I mayagree on this, but it should be a very detailed and legal-bullet-proof one forthe rest of the user world.luctur: Could you explain how the font copyright situation is different from anyother copyrighted content? Should OpenOffice.org also remove support forembedded images and even text, because they may be copyrighted and distributedunder licenses that exposes people to infringement claims? Should you have awindows that pops up every time someone opens a document and warns "An imagehas been embedded under license XYZ"?insount: the difference between an embedded image and a embedded font is that, usually, the former is a *part* of the content, while the latter is an *attribute* of the content. Users pay different legal attention to these elements.Technically, it's well explained in the OpenDocument specifications and it's also a logical valid argument, in this case.Then, there are also documents, i.e. trade logos or artistic drawings, in which the *visual representation* of a font - not the font itself - may be part of the content. In those cases, the legal concerns are completely different and less important for the average users, since they should have or have had a professional legal support that explains what can or cannot do with their logo's "representation".I have no power to block or unblock this issue, but i'd prefer not to add another element for which I have to check the license, especially if that addition is automatically done by a software application and it may be not clearly evident for the embedder or other users of a document(read: me)(sorry for my bad english)Here we can see an exellent example of how copyrights can inhibite technicalprogress :-)Please note that fonts that we usually calls "free" can be not so free as wethink. For example, user of "liberation" fonts v1.0-1 must be located out ofCuba. Hyperbolic variant: is the font that can be used legally only at Moon freeor not free?Other interesting thing is from "dejavu" fonts v2.24: "The above copyright andtrademark notices and this permission noticeshall be included in all copies of one or more of the Font Softwaretypefaces." Does it mean that text of license of this fonts must be included indocument that has this fonts in embedded form?The next thing. Many of people here say about "legal nightmare" that we willhave if embedding fonts in OpenOffice documents will be implemented. But nowOpenOffice can export documents to PDF. I do not know technical details, but itlooks like resulting PDFs have embedded fonts. And AFAIK editing of PDFs featurewill be implemented in future. Please note that OpenOffice does not show anywarnings about legal problems when create PDFs. By the way. This is question to all people here who want OpenOffice withoutfonts embedding but want to use free software and free fonts. How do you sendyou documents to Windows users? I have a problem with this now. When I give an odt document to my colleagues -Windows users for editing, I give them also a distributive of OpenOffice +archive with fonts on USB flash drive + instructions how to install this fontsinto Windows. The solution of this problem is using only "liberation" fontsfamily. This fonts has same metric that main Windows fonts and documents can beopened properly on Windows even if "liberation" fonts is not installed. But"liberation" family have no font with "times"-like view ("Liberation Serif" havesame metric that "Times New Roman"), so limitation to use only this font familyis very restrictive. The other problem I have is broken font that have different metric in differentformats. Document that using this font in Type-1 format on GNU/Linux can not betransfered to Windows where this font is in TrueType format because an intervalbetween text lines is different :-(To luctur:don't know nothing about its license.What about a new font format with embedded license? Or about petitions tocurrent font formats authors with ask to add obligatory license text to fontfiles in this formats?sergey_feo: indeed, PDF font embedding made by OOo is another strictly related issue that is open since years. Just check this OOo issue tracker for "PDF fonts" or similar query string and you'll find people who want an option in order to *not* embed fonts into their PDF documents or to change what is embedded. The arguments in favor or against it are the same ones we are discussing here.However, in OOo PDF there is also a *huge* problem with font substitution: you believe to have included a specific font while OOo, really, has embedded Times New Roman instead of Times, Arial instead of Helvetica or, even, fonts that were used with a text style that is no longer utilized in the main content or that belong to the same font family of a font that has not the "embedding" bit set. Everything without warning from OOo, at least for the time being:Sometimes, you discovers these glitches because the PDF size is strange or grows out of control. Sometimes, you don't realize what is happening and simply go ahead with your work. Maybe, breaching the font license.Then, about font files that directly include license text: that is the right approach. Nevertheless, there should be a technical mean that shows those terms and clauses to the application end user in a human readable way.For example, GPL license text says: "An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion."I know this legal "stuff" for fonts is extremely annoying and most people doesn't care at all about it until a lawyer - or worse, an public attorney in those countries in which software piracy is a criminal law affair - contacts them.Finally, it would be interesting to know *how* a font could be embedded by respecting OpenDocument 1.2 specification. I'm not a developer and I'm just curious.luctur:Again, sorry for my English :-)I was really surprized by problem with font substitution in PDF export. If licensing problems is so big at this stage - we can prolong this line andthen next question will be: is flag "Print to file" in print dialog legal orillegal?..approach. How do you think: what is better: private e-mailing to font formats developerswith this request first or organizing community petitions without more ado? :-)I can try this if I will have a time.respecting OpenDocument 1.2 specification. I'm not a developer and I'm just curious.I do not know it for now also and just have hope that specification developersforesaw this. But even if fonts embedding was not foreseen by OpenDocumentspecification - its developers always can see how this feature realized in M$OpenXML. I believe it supports font embedding because of old .doc formats didthis. This can be a way how OpenXML can be helpful for community :-)I'll resume what has been said in this issue, just for simplicity:1) many people (82 votes for this issues) have a legitimate need for the font embedding feature;2) in the Agfa vs Adobe legal saga we've learned that a software producer *can* add this option without violating DMCA, but that fact has not prevented other corporations to start exactly the same claims before a court;3) unwanted embedding of fonts may cause to the end users serious troubles, like with GPL fonts without GNU font exception. A really good GUI that warns them is really needed if the feature is implemented;3) the tsType bits (those that say to 3rd party application what to do with a font) doesn't say nothing about the real license of a font, that can be very complex;4) I and others doesn't know if the font embedding is possible according to OpenDocument 1.2 specification.My suggestion is to enlarge this this discussion by posting toand(the former is better than the latter one) so that we can know whether:a) OpenDocument 1.2 or future specification can be used for embedding software;b) Sun considers font embedding in OOo a safe activity for itself;c) font embedding can be implemented with a simple and safe interface that prevents glitches (both legal and practical) like those present in PDF export.I think it's very important to know whether the feature is feasible according to ODF 1.2 so that we know the real problem is a legal one only.Whoever is interested in this issue can start the discussion in the mailing lists, just let us know so that we can join it. Without the attention of the community at large, I doubt this issue will never be reopened.But, please, in such discussion avoid comments like: "you know that some people sold by micro$oft can post interested comments in order to stop OpenOffice progress", because it would imply an underestimation, someone may say an insult, of the intelligence and independence of many people who have seriously contributed to this issue log.In some posts above we talk that font files that directly include license textis a good thing.I discover :-) that TTF font files can carry full license text (by non-standartway) and this is no necessarily to ask TTF format developers to add licensefields into TTF specification.This is about Bitstream Vera Fonts (): "Note that the Vera copyright is incorporated in the fonts themselves. TheLicense field in the fonts contains the copyright license as it appears below.The TrueType copyright field is not large enough to contain the full license, sothe license is incorporated (as you might think if you thought about it) intothe license field, which unfortunately can be obscure to find. (In pfaedit,see: Element->Font Info->TTFNames->License)."The technical details can be found here:(table 42"Name Identifiers", NameID codes 0, 13 and 14). We can see that fonts developersuse "License" field for license text but this field "should be written in plainlanguage, not legalese" according to specification because of "Copiright notice"field is too small. Future OpenOffice should know this trick.I surmise that TTF can have other formats.The situation with Type 1 fonts is not so good and far more compex.I found 3 file types related to Type 1 on my system: .afm, .pfa and .pfb.This was found in X11 font directory. It is possible that some other formatsexists in CUPS, ghostscript and xpdf directories.The specification for .afm is here:It discribes only optional "Notice" field (on page 26) that can contain "Fontname trademark or copyright notice".I view real .afm files on my machine and see short copyright info in "Comment"and "Notice" fields.I am not sure that specification for .pfa is this:This specification mentions "Notice" field but not describes it (at least I didnot found description). In real .pfa files I see short copyright info in comment(starting from "%%") and in "Notice" field.I did not found specification for .pfb format at this time.The CCF format for Type 1 also exists, specification is:It contains "Notice" and "Copyright" fields. Earlier versions of this documentcontained section 18 "Copyright and Trademark Notices" but it was removedaccording changelog. I did not found description of this fields in modernversion of document.The .pfm files also exists in nature. The document (not specification AFAIK)describing this format is here:It describes "dfCopyright" field in table 1 "Header". This field is "60 bytestring, null padded" so it can not contain full license text but can containlicense name (for example, "GPL + font exception").I surmise that Type 1 fonts can have yet more formats.Some places with links to specifications:This is current Open Document specification:.I did not found direct phrases like "fonts embedding" in it. Please have a look.If Open Document specification really does not support fonts embedding - thenOpenXML can be an example:.I found explicit phrases about fonts embedding in part 1, paragraph 15.2.12.I only recently found out about this issue and I hope I can give a real worldexample that would be helped by implementing something like this.I work for a small company which gives courses in unix related subjects and wemake our own course materials. These materials take a lot of work to make andthey are long term documents, meaning they have to survive software updates andbe portable to other systems (e.g. Solaris, Linux, BSD based unix systems).Portabilty would mean that the rendering of the page (in our case .odg files)must be the same, regardless of which OS is providing the fonts (we currentlyhave an issue with Linux based X-Servers used by openoffice (2.0) clientsrunning on solaris, don't know yet if an update to 3.0 will fix this). If a document carries its fonts embedded in the document, that factor is atleast out of the way and will make the document be more self-sufficient acrossplatforms and time.There may be other solutions to this problem that I'm not (yet) aware of, butembedding the fonts would seem like an essential feature for portability ofdocuments.As for the legal issues, I would place them firmly at the user's side. The useralone is responsible for the legality of embedding the fonts, the software may,of course, assist the user to determine the legality./Simon***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***So, OpenOfficers never will get ability to embed fonts? (a kind of hellraiserianmasochism I think)I would suggest taking (at least in this case) a consideration of how Microsoft has addressed this concern over font embedding, basically they state it is the end user's responsibility to make certain they are using extra fonts within that font publisher's license requirements, not Microsoft's concern."Most fonts are licensed from their original publishers, who may place additional restrictions on their use and distribution. For information about licensing arrangements for a given font, contact the original publisher."So, why then not consider going ahead with this very important feature with that approach? Why not just have a some sort of pop-up that warns the end user to be certain they are in compliance with the font licensing?This really is a much needed feature.Thanks for all the great work!Really needed.Fonts are contentious. Give me the option of including a copy of my TrueType Font file in my zip file (with an ODF extension), I've paid for the license for all the thousands of users in my company and I want an easy, platform-independent way of shifting editable documents around inside my organisation without having to send a separate font installation package with each document or having to deploy these glorified clipart-glyphs via my IT help desk.It is fortunate that God does not enforce his copyrights, or we'd all get nothing done!Really need the option of including a TrueType Font file in ODF-Files (writer,calc, draw and impress)@bitbastlerIf you really need it, you should start by voting for this issue with 2 votes.2 votes from me. This is really important. The legality of it all is up to me. For long term documents this is a must. Please find a way to to implement this.Of course it shouldn't be the default behavior, but a way to explicitly embed certain fonts used in a document is a really important feature. A warning could be shown about the implications of font embedding.I really don't see the reason for closing this bug if it's not on strong technical merit.(excume me for my bad English)MS Word XP suggests several symbol sets for embedding.AFAIK user can embed:- nothing- all- all without system fonts - all used symbols- all used symbols without system fonts.I suggest other variant as main for OpenOffice:- all used Unicode blocks.You can see what is Unicode block with "gucharmap" program under GNU/Linux forexample (you will need select "View"->"By Unicode Block" in menu).If we will embed all symbols then document size can be too big.If we will embed just used symbols then we will have problems with editingdocument in future. For example, some rare symbol from national alphabet ormathematical symbols that needed for editing can be lost.Embedding Unicode blocks is compromise between document size and symbols thatwill be available in the future.Please imagine that we write some mathematical document on Russian language. Itwill contain all symbols from Russian alphabet, some latin symbols, some greeksymbols, some punctuation symbols and some math symbols.Unicode blocks for embedding can be follows:- Basic Latin- Latin-1 Supplement- Greek and Coptic- Cyrillic- General Punctuation- Arrows- Mathematical Operators- Supplemental Mathematical OperatorsDocument size will not be very big. If we will edit this document in the futurethen it is high possibility that all symbols that we will need are alreadyembedded in document. For example, we will able to change "≠" to "≢" even if "≢"was not used in original document. And we will able use "γ" even if originaldocument used only "α" and "β".***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***This feature is very much needed. Please reopen it. I mostly use fonts under afree licence. Why should these legal issues hinder my work?If legal issues are a major problem, please consider to embed the new WOFF fonts(a container format for TTF) that will be supported in the next version ofFirefox. They will include the type of licence of the font. Hence, OpenOfficecould WARN the user, if there is a licence problem.Thanks@gleppertIf you really need it, you should start by voting for this issue with 2 votes.There is a betterchange of re-opening the issue when it is the top voted features wanted. We arenot even on the top 10 yet:***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***Most often the fonts I want to create documents with are those which areexplicitly distributable, but unfortunately have not acheived the distributionone might hope.There is much confusion about whether fonts can be held to a copyright anyway.It is the font PROGRAM, FILE, or CODE that is licensed. According to copyright law,"Familiar symbols or designs; mere variations oftypographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring..." are NOT eligible forcopyright protection.; click on “Copyright Basics” for more information.I find it remarkably silly that people have been so overly cautious aboutallowing the use of fonts. The intention of copyright law was never to disallowanyone from creating THEIR OWN ORIGINAL works in the style which they choose. Adocument is not a derivitive work of a font. The document displays the letteringwhich cannot be copyrighted.The problem is that when a font is embedded, the resulting file IS a derivitiveof the font (program, code). Part of the copyrighted code is included with thedocument. If this code was protected so that it cannot be extracted or used on acomputer that does not have the font installed, then the document cannot beedited on that computer, or effectively archived.Perhaps there is a way to create an approved font list for fonts that are knownand documented to be distributable, and allow fonts on that list to be embedded.There are some really great open fonts available these days. There would belittle need to use the fonts with restrictive licenses if we could just sharethe non-restricted ones freely.The licenses can be found. I'm suggesting the possibility that people couldsumbit fonts they want on that list with the name, filename, and links toverifiable license documentation.can we please re-open this issue to avoid a gazillion of comments like this ? :)i think everybody agrees that the need is there, technical means are there and legal issues are for users, not for the software (see any pdf exporting software...).ps. yes, i voted on this issue with 2 votes :)It seems that this is also planned for the ODF file format standard in thefuture:So why not reopen again?Please re-open this issue; it is preventing proper displaying of documents onother platforms, and as such a big obstacle for interoperability.The copyrights issue is a non-issue if you ask me, many fonts ARE open licensed,and also, I have not seen a request to disable picture embedding because I couldbe inserting a picture on which I don't have the copyright? Please leave this tothe user.please, repone this issue.the copyright thing is a false obstacleGiven, how often people asked to reopen this issue, how many duplicates wereidentified, and how many votes (113) are there for this issue, please reopen this.Another question: How much demand should users in an open source project expressso that they deserve to be heard?reopening this issue won't help at all. If you want this feature, provide a patch.If the issue would be reopened, then it would be open, but still not implemented.Once the font-embedding made its way into the official ODF-format, then things are different. But until then: Don't expect the feature to be added. It is not like OOo not having enough other bugs to fix/other features to add.@cloph: O.k. then let's reopen this issue. After that, we can wait for theimplementation. At least the flag "WONTFIX" would be removed. This is a firststep, at least.@cloph,gleppert: I agree with both of you: Even though re-opening the issue willnot make it implemented, it will generate the some benefits:* People will not post non-productive comments on this issue about re-opening it.* The issue will be more visible in statistics and may encourage more people tovote for it.* Developers can justify working on the issue.* It will be fair to answer: "Send in a patch or pay someone to do it".So: Go on re-open the issue and let the issue work its way through the system asit normally would.***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***Dear OpenOffice.org developers,given the zero replies to the post by 'tange' for almost a month now, I assumethat it was not read by anyone. Please reopen this issue or provide any relevantreason why it should not be reopened. Thank you in advance.OK. There you have it. A reopened issue that will get aboslutely the same treatment like before: None.just a reminder:"export to pdf" will have the fonts embeded. It can be done in writer component.So the legality issue is a false issue.At least implement free font and highlight them as free to save. Might encourageall to start making free font the defacto instead of those that refuse to allowopenoffice to save.If you haven't already, take a look at www.fontsquirrel.com. You can easily include the fonts for which you have rights in your web page. You can even embed/encode them inside a CSS file.The technical ability to embed fonts in Open Office documents is essential for any serious document standard going forward. PDF has it, DOCX has it, even the open web now has it. Without action, obsolescence threatens the ORACLE investment in the OpenOffice brand.May I suggest bringing up this topic to dev@openoffice mailing list?No flames, no accusations, no cursewords, just short message describing why thisis necessary, competitive analisys, legal considerations, etc.This way the issue will get attention from many more developers and we may getsome meaningfull reply.Since Apache does embedding with PDF when we export MS Office documents to PDF, wouldn't it be something trivial to achieve now that Apache runs OpenOffice and it is 2012?Our primary publishing tools are MS Office-based, but we also have scenarios where our documents may be opened using OpenOffice and we need those fonts embedded. It really ruins the effects of our materials when the embedded font is not honored and displayed properly.My bad... got my Adobe mixed with my Apache. Obviously, Abode is the PDF company.

LARGE() not works fine.Plese look at 3 files which I attached.#Japanese Q&A ()作成された添付 (id=53791)MS-Excel file(Created Excel 2003).作成された添付 (id=53792)capture of original(Excel file) result.作成された添付 (id=53793)capture of opening by OOo2.4.0 original(Excel file) result.Thanks for letting us know. Problem is that LARGE() and SMALL() do not return anarray in this case, but only a single value instead, as can also be seen with=SUM(LARGE(A1:A10;{1;2;3})).Note that in Excel =SUM(LARGE(A1:A10,B1:B3)) with B1:B3 containing {1,2,3} isnot the same and does not evaluate as an array, but generates an error instead.In array evaluation also a 2D array is handled as second parameter, as can beseen with =COLUMNS(LARGE(A1:A10,{1,2;3,4})) and =ROWS(LARGE(A1:A10,{1,2;3,4}))Reopening this issue and adapting summary to reflect detail.Other quirks observed in Excel:For LARGE(list;N), ROUNDUP(N;0) is applied, not INT(N).For SMALL(list;N), probably ROUNDDOWN(N;0) is applied, effectively being INT(N)for positive numbers.

Well, atleast unexpected, though perhaps explainable ...First, when you switch the anchor from a cell to the sheet, you need to get theshape's position first, and restore it after setting the Anchor property. Thisway, the control/shape stays where it was before changing the anchor. Otherwise,the position previously relative to the cell is now relative to the sheet, whichmakes the control jumping.Second, when you switch the anchor from the sheet to a cell, you also need toadjust the position, to prevent the control jumping. You might want to look intothe impl_setSheetAnchorType_nothrow method into see how I solved that.In any way, I would argue that the strange behavior of the position is anotherissue (if at all), since this one here is named "can not set AnchorType ...",which is not true anymore.Hi Frank,from my point of view it should be possible to set a control - anchored to the sheet - for example to an absolut X/Y position like 3cm/3cm at the moment it will added to the drawpage - first set all properties,than add to drawpage ..in writer there is a property "AnchorType": com.sun.star.text.TextContentAnchorType.AT_PAGE/AT_CELL which will do the job ...in calc i have to add the control to the drawpage first, change the "Anchor" form cell to sheet (cause cell is default) and than have to set the new position cause 3/3cm changed undefinitly to 0,74/0,29 cm - so as you mentionend - before - the control will move ...... this is a bit unfortune i agree we could open a new issue ...Oliverso this is the workaound for the moment:oPosition.X = 3000oPosition.Y = 3000 [...]oDrawPage.add(oControlShape)oControlShape.setPropertyValue("Anchor", oSheet)oControlShape.setPosition(oPosition)

I shall shortly attach abacktrace from the SIGABRT.Is there anything that I can do here to help?Createdbacktrace from SIGABRTI again checked with DEV300m90 on ubuntu, but the file won't lead to a crash.Maybe there is a compile error on your site? You should discuss this perhaps ina developer channel.The backtrace shows that the path to the crash came through functionsand macros with names including "DEBUG", "DBG", and "debug". Thismakes me suspect that I am getting this code because of my non-productbuild. (Hmm. Why, I wonder, did I not see anything from the call to__stl_debug_message() at _debug.c:303? Oh well.)Looking intoDomainMapperTableHandler::endTableGetCellProperties(TableInfo&),defined at TableHandler.cxx:515, I see that line 521 allocates anempty container and then line 526 attempts to calculate end()-1. Itis entirely reasonable that the code implementing this shouldcomplain.This reminds me thatrequests that fired assertionsshould abort the program. This issue provoked considerablediscussion in the thread starting with<>.Still, I guess that sb was not asking for the program just to crash.Or maybe one of the scores of assertions raised before the crashactually explains the crash; I have not looked very far backward fromthe crash itself.If these comments sound plausible, then some ideas come to mind ...(*) The STL code could helpfully fire an assertion before aborting the program. This would allow a motivated user the attach a debugger and collect a backtrace upon seeing the problem for the first time. Is it sufficient to fire the assertion just before the _STLP_ABORT() that killed the program this time? Or should the STL code be sprinkled with assertions? I am not qualified to have an opinion.(*) Is it legitimate for the container allocated at DomainMapperTableHandler.cxx:521 to be empty? ( Line 526 assumes that the container has at least one element. Lines 535 and 559 appear to avoid that assumption, but that is the natural result of the usual idiom for iterating over the elements in a container; I do not see it as saying much about the code actually expecting an empty container. ) If the empty container is legitimate, then line 526 is simply wrong. If the empty container is not legitimate, then the program might reasonably complain and refuse to open the file, or complain and open the file anyway, or just open the file without complaint.BTW, if I save the document from OOo as a .docx file, I can open thesaved file without a crash. However, OOo writes a file so differentfrom the original that I cannot tell what is the important difference.In a non-product build, the STL assertion aborts. Still occurs in DEV300m100.

id=114097	open the attached document. It contains a chart with some simple data, and abutton. Press the button - it runs a macro which modifies the data of theembedded chart. As you notice, the chart is not updated. Only if you force arepaint - e.g. by moving another window over the chart and back -, the new chartcontent is shown.Effectively, this means that there's an invalidation missing in Writer, when anembedded object is modified while not being activated.Note that the problem does not happen in Calc. This is because Writer's OLEobject implementation differs from those of the other applications. Theimportant difference, with respect to this issue here, is the following:An SdrOle2Obj object adds an XModifyListener to the XModel of the embeddeddocument - see SdrOle2Obj::AddListeners_Impl. In the call toXModifyListener::modified, the SdrObject is invalidated, by calling itsSetChanged method (see SvxUnoShapeModifyListener::modified). This results inrepainting the object.I'd say Writer should implement something similar for its own OLE objectimplementation ... may be this is an opportunity to fix issues 79127 (Writer doesn't supportXChartDataChangeEventListener) at the same time?meantCreateddocument to reproduce the bug caseThere are two ways to update the window. One is to invalidate the controller window ( this could be more than one) This is equivalent to pressing Shift+Ctrl+Rthiscomponent.getcurrentcontroller.getframe.getcomponentwindow.invalidate( 1 )the other is to refresh the model which is equivalent to Tools/Update/Pageformatting ( and takes longer )thiscomponent.refresh@os: you're not saying that this crappy workaround (invalidating the completewindow, or even refreshing the complete document) should be the responsibilityof each and every client of Writer, are you?What do you mean with "each and every client"? In general the application does not need to expect that _inactive_ OLE objectsare changing. You hopefully don't think that the repaint of the window takessubstantial resources compared to the resources needed for changing the chartdata, are you?"each and every client" means "each and every OOo API client whichprogrammatically modifies charts". In the other OOo applications, suchmodifications are recognized by the application, and the respective shape isrepainted. Writer is the only app where this doesn't work.My headache with invalidate is that it almost always means flickering, on someplatformats with some X-servers, with some <whatever> side conditions.Invalidating the complete window would just not be needed, if Writer would fixthis properly.And that's the statement I'd like to challenge. What is our API good for, if weput a "but don't do this!"-label on every second interface?->fs: Nobody said something about 'don't do this'.At some point in the future the OLE objects of Writer might be replaced by OLEshapes from the drawing engine. This should result in the behavior you request.With more than 1600 open issues with targets 3.[3|4|x] ATM for Word processor Iconsider this one as Worksforme."There exists a workaround" is not the same thing as "worksforme" (which wouldmean: cannot reproduce).Reopening, targeting to Later.I think, that the macro has an error.After the lines data(0) = rowData() chart.Model.Data.setData( data() )in sub modifyChartDataupdate is missing.

The organizer does not and should not copy values inherited from other styles.'The organizer does not and should not copy values inherited from other styles.'* Is this specified in the documentation?* So, the size (14) was copied because it was not inherited from Titre2?* This behaviour conflicts with what most users expect from a 'copy' operation--ie, a copy should be identical.->tab: I can't see your problem. The style contains three attributes. The newstyle contains the same three attributes, too. From my point of view this is anexact copy. It's in the nature of styles that they inherit attributes from their parents andfrom the document's default settings. The first page of the style dialog showsthe name of the parent style and the values that are defined in this style. Allother dialog pages show the resulting attributes. A "deep" copy in the organizerdoesn't make sense as it would break the style feature.os writes: The style contains three attributes. The newstyle contains the same three attributes, too. From my point of view this is anexact copy.**The original specifies 'three attributes': Font: arial; typeface: bold; size:14pt. The copy has, of course the same 'three attributes', but two havedifferent values: Font: Times New Roman; typeface: regular; only the size iscopied. You call that an 'exact copy'? Semantics aside, I copy a style because I like its look --say, arial bold; whyshould a 'Titre3' in DocumentB look different from a 'Titre3' in DocumentA? Doesnot consistency require that a style look the same everywhere --within adocument, and from one document to another? (Of course, I can edit the copy ofTitre3 and make it different from the original, but that's another matter.) Why is only the size copied? 'The first page of the style dialog shows the name of the parent style and thevalues that are defined in this style.All other dialog pages show the resulting attributes.'**What do you mean by 'first' and 'other dialog pages'? Are you referring totabs like 'Organizer', 'font', 'tabs'?->tab: Styles are hierarchical definitions. The actual setting applied by astyle is the result of the settings of the style, it's parents and document orapplication default settings. In case of your template the setting of the font name comes from the applicationdefaults. If I open your template document here I the font is Arial. That's mysetting here. To see the style dialog put the cursor into a paragraph that uses the Style"Titre 3" and call "Edit paragraph style" from the context menu or open theStylist, select the style and call Edit from the context menu there.os: 0: 'The actual setting applied by astyle is the result of the settings of the style, its parent...'Sounds confusing to me. In the end, which settings are inherited, and which onescan be set anew? (Back to my question: Why is only the size copied?) Obviously,'Linked with' should not mean 'identical to'.I set the font to xyz, why, and when, should it change to 'your setting' Arial?Let me attempt to answer my own question: If I leave a field (say, Font) blank,that means I want to retain the 'Linked' font. That would make sense. But itdoes not work that way --I tried it.1: 'To see the style dialog...' I know how to modify a style. Copying a stylewas supposed to save me some work...

And that would offer to use the mail-merge to create flexible listings.***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***This is a serious issue... and still confusing and irritating my users inversion 2.3, almost two years after "joesny" first reported it.Under no case should blank pages be added to a merge document, unless the userhas specifically requested it... and there are no such options in any mergedialog. Starting a new page with each record makes perfect sense, but notadding blank pages.If I open a saved, merged document that was a one page form merged with threerecords, I expect three pages. Instead, I get content, blank, content, blank,content. That is FIVE pages. When I click on the first page, the pageindicator says "Page 1/5" when I then click on the only other next page I canfind, it says "Page 1 3/5"!! So something is also trying to hide the blankpages, making them extremely difficult to remove or even see, and messing up thepage indicator too. They are visible, however, if you do a page preview of thedocument.I don't see how this really has anything to do with duplex as has been suggestedin other comments. In our case, no printer or printer settings are ever set toduplex before or after merging a document. If this problem was created withduplex in mind, then the document should have been 6 pages in the above example,not 5.And, although this is probably not the appropriate location for the comment-there should be a THIRD option in the UI for the merge dialog, "create and opennew document". It should be unnecessary to "print" the document to a file, thenturn around and manually open the document to look at it. Simply open up a newwindow with the new, merged document in it. And that should be set as thedefault option- not printing, not saving to a single file, not saving tomultiple files.If you check user behavior- I bet 90%+ of people will want to look at what theymerged to make sure it is correct, before printing it. Currently, this meansalways having to save it out, then having to open it back up again. And thisblank page bug is validation as to why users want and need to look at thedocument before printing.The reason for blank pages is the fact that the page number corresponds to leftor right pages. As the merge doesn't check whether a page number is used or notit assigns the starting page number of the source - usually 1 - to the firstpage of each resulting merge. The Writer _always_ inserts the blank pages tofill the gaps between left/left or right/right pages. This has nothing to dowith mail merge. If we wouldn't insert this blank page printing on duplexprinters wouldn't work. You would always get two letter on one sheet.That's not messing up anything. In case of "Page 1 3/5" the page indicator showsthat you are at a page with the number 1 that is the third page out of 5.There' no need for a trailing empty page. The printing takes care for it at theend of the print job.Which current two options do you mean that need a third option?<blank page bug is validation as to why users want and need to look at theOn page 7 of the wizard there's a button to check the resulting document. Idon't see the need to open the resulting document by default after the merge isdone. The wizard also takes care for printing the pages correctly. Issue resolved as wontfix.Please explain why this bug was closed as WONTFIX?- Don't you agree that there's a problem or is it just to complicated to fix?If I do a 7 records mail merge for a 1 page document to a new document and thenconvert the document to pdf (by clicking "Export as PDF file") my pdf file willbe a 14 pages pdf file with every other page blank.I am absolutely blown away that this is now marked as "WONTFIX"! It is mostcertainly a BROKEN behavior. Let's analyze:1) 90%+ of printers in use today are simplex, not duplex. So it breaks thebehavior on 90% of the printers. This is an exaggeration. I would be glad toprovide a poll of my 100+ user Linux user's group, if you like. If you reallyfelt it was necessary to insert blank pages for duplex printers, then check thecurrent printer properties to see if duplex is on by default before ruining thedocument.2) Even on duplex printers, it is not necessary to send blank pages, unless youare actually using it in duplex mode at the time. All duplex printers I haveever used (and I have used many) do not enter duplex mode unless specificallyrequested by the application, or if left permanently "on" in the printingsubsystem (which is also exceedingly rare).3) People don't necessarily want to use the complicated wizzard for a merge. Inmany cases, wizards can be more complex than just doing what you want withoutgoing through lots of additional questions.4) Saving a merged file is not the same function as printing directly. So evenif most printers were duplex (which they most certainly are not), saving thefile should NOT have the behavior. 5) I can almost guarantee that the vast majority of users are going to beconfused and irritated by the current behavior of inserting unnecessary blank pages.6) Yes the page number indicator is wrong, it should not always show you asbeing on page one. If I start a brand new document and insert several hardpages, it works correctly- it doesn't say I am on page "1" for every page I moveto. Of course, this could be some other type of bug and unrelated to this issue.->hvedk: The issue is set to WONTFIX because it cannot be fixed in a sensibleway without either breaking something else (like the page number and the duplexprinting) or by implementing a different left/right page behaviour of the Writer. The mail merge just cannot do miracles.->crxssi: You probably didn't understand my explanation. So here it comes in ashort form.- Each resulting document part has to start with page number 1. Otherwise f.e.page number fields would be wrong. - Each page with an odd number is a right page. In a Writer document blank pagesare inserted if and odd page follows and odd page or an even page follow an evenpage. Printing of such blank pages can be suppressed usingtools/options/Writer/Print/Print automatically inserted blank pages. There'scurrently no such options for PDF export.- The page number field in the status bar shows the current page number and thenumber of pages. If the page number is set manually via Insert/Break/Page breakwith Style and Change page number (or the related setting in Format/Paragraph)then it also shows the index of the page. This is not related to mail merge.- It is not necessarily possible to detect if a printer is duplex or not. Thisinformation is not accessible on all platforms (if on any at all) that aresupported from OOo.- If you don't want to use a wizard then use the mail merge dialog that can beconfigured under tools/customize under Documents/Mail merge. This either printsdirectly or saves a single file (with the same page issue) or multiple files.The typical use case that I know about is to mail merge a letter to a list ofpersons either as printouts or as e-Mail. What is the use case of exporting a mail merged document to a PDF-file?Regarding PDF- you are confusing me with "hvedk"... I never used that example,although I agree with his logic. I consider the extra pages as a contaminationof the resulting merged output. It makes it difficult to print, difficult toreview, and difficult to convert to PDF.As for the wizard- I hate it. It is confusing, long, and doesn't do at all whatI want to do, which is to simply grab a few fields from a spreadsheet and placethem in a docuemnt I have already designed.I do understand your explanation, I just still don't agree with it. I think itis more broken in its current form, for more people, than it would be if theblank pages were not added. If the user WANTED to print it in duplex, thenhaving the merge contain extra blank pages defeats that and makes them printsimplex. If the merge had no blank pages, it will still not print in duplexunless the user had the printer locked down to ALWAYS print EVERYTHING induplex. And I have *never* seen anyone do that (in 22 years as an IT professional).Typically, using merge, the user will want separate physical pages for eachrecord. But that is not ALWAYS the case. In WordPerfect, for example, I usemerging all the time to make fancy reports in which there are more than onerecord on a printed page. I also use merging to create multipart pages, inwhich one page will be cut into separate physical parts later. Inserting blankpages (or even new pages in these cases) tends to make that even more difficult.I belive I understand some of the constraints with duplex. But at a veryminimum- there should be a choice in the merge dialog if the user wants to haveartifically added blank pages or not, with the default being "no". I wouldpropose this:Page Control: [ ] Streaming- no pages breaks between records [*] Page breaks- each record on a separate page [ ] Page breaks plus an extra blank pageI agree, this needs to be fixed, WONTFIX is not OK.Well, I would love to know how to make the developers take notice that it is apretty serious problem that should be fixed and the current behavior really isbroken. There have been half a dozen duplicate bug reports, and many people whoare not satisfied.I fear once it is "resolved" as "wontfix", that is the end. Any new postings ofa similar nature will just point back to this one.os, if you are unwilling to fix this issue, would you please reassign it andreopen it.I also can not agree with WONTFIX.I looked through the Wizards, and did not see anything about mail merge. Theonly place mail merging is done is from clicking Print.This problem still exists in 2.4 rc4 (m10)I need to print envelopes from a ods spreadsheet-database, and also have a odttemplate/document formated for envelopes.I get a blank page every other record, and this is not on a printer with duplexcapability. I have to feed it 10 envelopes at a time, and then pick out half tore-feed the printer.Also it does not help to export to pdf and unselect the option "Exportautomatically inserted blank pages" unless I should be printing my envelopesfrom a pdf file??Would this issue get more attention if I File a new bug report or vote for thisissue?Great rejoicing!I found where to suppress the blank pages:After the Print Mail merge is completed and the resulting odt file is loaded,Click Options in the Print Dialog, Then uncheck "Print automatically insertedblank pages"Caution, This option does not remember your preference. Remember to uncheck itevery time.This issue is fixed after all.That was suggested in this thread two years ago by "intersol". But I stillwouldn't consider it fixed, I would consider that to be a "workaround"1) The merge shouldn't put extra pages in, unless the user chooses to do so. Most users will have no idea why extra pages would be a hard-coded default (meniether)2) Most users wouldn't know where to go to try and change the supress setting.3) What is on the screen is confusing, regardless, with the strange left/rightpage numbering.4) I think supressing the extra pages in the print dialog will not help with"save as", when you create a report or something and want to export it as anASCII text file for futher editing.***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***This "feature", which is really a serious bug, also prevents any so-called"catalog" merge from having proper page numbers.

Yes, it is still a big problem for my users. It is a frequent drain ofsupport time in my department trying to explain to users and help work-aroundthe broken behavior of OO adding blank pages in merges.If the developers are unwilling to change the UI, can't we at least have asystem-level flag/setting somewhere to turn off the blank pages generation?In reference to: cornouws Fri Sep 24 20:57:02 +0000 2010 Yes, I did turn off that option on all printers including the CUPS printer andit did not work. I decided to try it again and this time it did work correctly(at least for the CUPS printer), but that is because it only works after youselect print (in preparation to print the document) then turn it off. Thanks formentioning it again. Mine now works (or at least worked once).There was a no fix argument posed in this thread and I have to weigh in with another common use case for mail merge: postcards, which is no different conceptually to the issues users are having trying to print envelopes, or one page documents on the typical simplex printer. The addition of blank pages makes no sense in this context. This makes these runs very cumbersome, even if the suppress printing blank pages option is used.Note also the doubling of the page numbers makes re-starting after a print jam unnecessarily difficult. In the print dialog which has a great thumbnail viewer, this is how one would normally find their way back to a midpoint in the run, scrolling to the last printed document, noting the page number, then setting the page print range to that + 1 through the last page number, ie: resume printing where you left off. However, the page numbers in the preview don't match those in the specify print rage: in the former, the page number without the suppressed blanks is displayed and makes intuitive sense, but the "specify print range" works only with the doubled page numbers. In effect, you have two tools side by side in the same dialog box that are using different page numbering rules(!)So, if you have 550 actual pages (or cards, or envelopes) and need to restart the printing at page 500 through 550, you can locate card #500 in the preview, verify visually it's the one you want to restart with. Butif you plug that value into the print page range you end up with not 50 but 25 printed cards (because of the suppressed page number gaps) and the pages printed will be from around the actual page 250, pages you've already printed. Ouch! Anyone doing serious mail merge work knows you need a reliable restart function as printers will always have jams, glitches, timeouts in the middle of a longer run.Again, the "suppress printing blanks" was a decent band-aid to keep from spitting out a blank after every printed page, but failed to address the fundamental issue with page numbering in what appears to be the most common use case, where the page number should reflect the actual position of the page in the document, for various (and obvious) reasons. A previous poster had a good suggestion: give us an options flag for Writer that allows the suppression of the actual addition of the blank pages, and all this other difficulty and mess can be avoided. It doesn't even need to be the default, but the option to invoke it is critical to the value of Writer as a good general purpose mail merge tool. I also think it's time to reconsider making no blank insertions to be the default mail merge behavior.Thanks,Mark***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***Regina: Can you pls comment on my, made 9 months ago. Do you understand/agree that using the suppress blank pages option still leaves the user with incorrect and mismatched page numbers in preview vs print page range? Due to this, the bug cannot be listed as nofix, the current workaround introduces an egregious page numbering bug and needs to be revisited as recommended. Again, we would recommend mail merge should (actually) work for simplex printing, by default, and duplex printers should be asked to select an option to support the duplex mode. Or at least allow a working option for one page simplex mailmerge printing with accurate page numbering, which OO does not have today. Thanks, it's a big deal to many as the thread clearly shows.I agree 100% with "Mark OB." It is hard to believe it has been almost 7 years of waiting now...Users simply do not understand the crazy page numbering and there is never any reason that merged labels, envelopes, cards, etc should be pseudo (or real) double-sided. If the user wants double sided, they can choose that option in the print dialog. The current method is very confusing and makes printing selected pages extremely difficult.I have to agree that there needs to be a solution to this 'feature'. It is ridiculous that it has gone on this long. There should be an option to select duplex printing instead of assuming it by default when performing the merge so that an unsuspecting user doesn't end up printing 100 blank pages by accident and then has to go through and sort out the blank pages from the printed pages. What a pain in the a$$ that was.OK, here we go again with Laufzettel_Maske_A5.odt which is a serial document of mine with "Print automatically inserted blank pages" = OFFThe nextA5M.odt a resulting document after merging the former into a single file (and with confidential data removed). It has "Print automatically inserted blank pages" = ON Observation #1: The serial print does not inherit this setting from its source document."Print automatically inserted blank pages" seems to be a document specific option. However, I uncheck this option for the merged document the document's modified status does not change. Step by step:File>PrinterSettings... [Options] "Print automatically inserted blank pages" = OFFThe document remains unmodified.File>SaveAs... <other name>File>CloseFile>Open... <other name>The option remains unchecked in this new copy.Observation #2: The modified document setting does not change the modified status.Alternative method:File>Print... [Ctrl+P], second tab, uncheck "Print automatically inserted blank pages"Cancel the dialogFile>SaveAs... <other name>File>CloseFile>Open... <other name>The option remains unchecked in this new copy.Observation #3: OpenOffice applies a setting from a canceled dialog.CreatedMail merge document with "Print automatically inserted blank pages" = OFFCreatedMerged output with "Print automatically inserted blank pages" = ONOh, and I forgot to stress the ovious matter of fact that there is no way to get the pages right when you print to a printer directly.Sorry, this was a false statement. After the temporary document has been created, the final print dialog allows you to turn off the magic option.The behaviour is controlled by registrymodifications.xcu:<item oor:path="/org.openoffice.Office.Writer/Print"><prop oor:name="EmptyPages" oor:op="fuse"><value>false</value></prop></item>This global setting is accessible via Tools>Options:"Print automatically inserted blank pages"In a Writer document's settings.xcu the setting is stored as<config:config-item config:name="PrintEmptyPages" config:type="boolean">false</config:config-item>This document specific setting is accessible via File>PrinterSettings>[Options...]and on the second tab of the print dialog. The document setting does not change the modified status which may be worth another bug report.Any mail merge output inherits the setting from the global configuration. However, it should be inherited from the source document. Or may be not?Even with the help of wikipedia I do not understand what "Duplex" means and why it requires blank sheets of paper, but I think this shouldn't be a document specific setting nor should it be stored globally. I think it is printer specific, isn't it? Dialog File>PrinterSettings... indicates configuration settings for each printer that has been selected from the list box. However, the sub-dialog [Options] writes only one item for all printers into registrymodifications.xcu(In reply to Andreas Säger from)"Duplex" just means "printing on both sides of the paper". Automatic duplexing is something a printer can do, optionally, if it has the ability to turn the paper over and print on the other side. It can be done manually too, although this is quite a challenge for multi-page documents.It requires blank pages if the program assumes the printer WILL be printing duplex, and yet you are actually printing something like labels, envelopes, or forms, which are NOT duplex and must not be printed duplex. The root problem is that it should never assume a printer will default to printing duplex... that just makes no sense in any environment I have ever seen.Whether a printer can (is able to) print duplex or not is a printer setting (or a CUPS setting). Whether you WANT it to print duplex is another, totally different setting. I can't imagine that anyone would really want duplex printing "on" by default.Yes, but why does printing on both sides require entirely blank sheets of paper inserted between the first printed ones? In most cases this is just a major annoyance. Anyhow, it is off topic and difficult to explain. I should set up a printer to work this way and watch it in real life.Although you can set it up in the template of your serial letter, the output does not follow this setup. Instead it reads this property from a global setting which may be unknown and which is ON by default. If the setting is not in the registrymodifications.xcu then it defaults to ON.I was so focussed on the document specific setting in the two print dialogs that I forgot about the third setting in Tools>Options.
id=49604	In MS Office, when you have a document with mailmerge fields (or input fields), if you are manually entering the data, MS Office allows you to use "F11" to jump the next mailmerge (or input) field (and Shift+F11 to jump back). When it jumps to that field it hightlights as well so you just need to type to replace it. My organization and many others manually process huge volumes of letters and use these mailmerge fields as "fill in the blank" based on the customer we're dealing with at the time. You obviously can manually mouse/arrow over and then highlight the field but it adds a HUGE amount of overhead and makes us less productive. It is the only thing preventing us on using Open Office vs MS Office.

I will try to test soon with m130, but because of the immense backupprocedure necessary because of unfixed, I currently do not installall new 680 versions - too much work, too much risk.It seems to be a little tricky! I tried my testkit from Mon Jan 31 02:36:00 with2.0 (1.9.m125) German version WIN XP: [680m125(Build8947)] and was not able toreproduce the problem. Another fact is that I have this problem every few Dayson my PC with 680m125, when I forget that problem and open a .ods from WINExplorer. The exciting question now is, why that happens for several of myfiles, but not for others? I will still do several tests within the next days,but if I can't create a new testkit with new files from 680m125 (or later) toreproduce this problem, I will close this issue WFM (latest: Oct. 16th).I am not able to create a testkit with newly created files, I only see thiseffect in some older documets. So WFM.I checked with â€œ2.0 German version WIN XP: [680m3(Build8968)]â€ and I have beenable to reproduce the bug with 2.0.Currently it seems that that problem does not appar using only 2.0, but if youhave 1.1.4 content in your file, the problem happens.How I reproduced the bug creating testkit 'newtestkit20a.zip'Preparations:1.

No change in the merged numbering.However, performing the merge, to a single document, then opening that document and setting the footnote numbering "per page" was effective.So if all the footnotes are on the same page, this can be a useful workaround.If the notes are spread over more than one page, may be a top-level heading could be added (hidden or something) to get the numbering to reset.
id=122367	I think it's important to know whether a bug has been introduced within last 2 years or inherited from old OOo versions. Because of this fact currently for several Products/Components "Pre AOO 3.4.0" is available. But unfortunately for others (Writer/UI, ...) it's not, what is inconsistent, worrying and an unnecessary lack of information. This request might (ironically) get lost in the bug tracker; better send a mail to dev@ with the tag [bugzilla] in the subject (you don't need to subscribe to the list).Is there a list of which products are missing this version string?(In reply to Rob Weir from)I did not check that systematically because it's much work in the Bugzilla userinterface.But it's very easy to check and modify that in the BZ administration interface, so I think if there is consensus what versions BZ should show for AOO Components A BZ admin can do the necessary changes without additional preparation.Proceeding for non AOO Products (Infrastructure, extensions, ...) should be handled separatelyI've added "pre AOO 3.4.0" as a permitted version string in BZ.Yes, works fine, thanks!"pre AOO 3.4.0" still missing for bug submission 'Writer'Odd. It was there but the "enabled for new bugs" flag was disabled. Try it now.CreatedMy Confirmation Test ResultsI did a small sample and did not find such a Pre 3.x anywhereStrange, it seems that Rob's fix has been lost?
id=92909	The Sun PDF Import extension Beta 0.3.1 Solaris x86 on ooo3.0 Beta 2 BuildBEB300_m3 produces a rotation when a skew is applied, after that othertransformations are somewhat garbled. In the attached file Leers.text.pdf, whenviewed in ooo or a pdf viewer, in the top right corner of every page you find alegend with some short text strings, the third line in every legend is a latinspecies name that should be skewed not rotated, when you open this pdf file in atext editor then line 4980 reads "q 1 0 0.2 1 632 533 cm", q saves the currentgraphics state, then a transformation is applied. If this file is saved as anooo drawing and that new file is then unzipped, form a terminal: "unzipLeers.text.odg", then in the file Contents.xml this transformation is translatedto "draw:transform="rotate (-0.197396738401708) translate (22.295cm 1.933cm)",this would have been correct had the pdf transformation matrix been "1 -0.2 0.21 632 533 cm", it appears that the third component of the matrix is duplicatedinto the second component of the matrix, however i am not certain that the signis inversed, it appears to be the case but there is probably more to it thanthat, the translation in the xml file does also not match the translation in thepdf file (fifth and sixth components of the matrix), when viewed in ooo howeverthe text appears in the correct position. Objects on the same page that appearafter this skewed/rotated object in the pdf file are placed in wrong positions,thus it seems the "Q" instruction on line 4987 in the pdf file does not fullyrestore the graphics state, or at least not the current transformation matrix,this incomplete or incorrect restoration does not always produce the same errorin the placement of objects, on different pages in the pdf document the textobjects in the legend (upper right) are misplaced in a different manner ondifferent pages.There are other things wrong when this file is importedbut those are different bugs.The attached file Leers.txt.pdf is a plain ascii file, so you can open it in anytext editor.

id=40813	Impress and Draw need to differentiate between 'slide' and 'page' in the ui. InImpress the term 'slide' should be used. In Draw the term 'page' should be used.I quick look on the help gives the impression that impress is ok (if not soplease create another task with higher Prio because Impress is considered to bemore important than Draw).But there are some items in Draw that have a wrong help text. Please correctthem but make sure that this correction changes the help only for the Drawmodule as the same uno commands are used for Impress and Draw:1) Draw: Menu-Edit- D~elete Slide...

This taskit as risk to make it into the final as it depends on another issue. In myopinion it would be nevertheless better to have a correct help here.So what's the status now?The help text was changed before the menus were adjusted. The help was matching the menu entries. Now it does no more.->UFI: *Never ever again* change the help for UI entries before you see thechanges in the UI.How do we proceed with this one now? Check in master after hc680pb3 is integratedand either retarget to later or set to invalid. Holy mess.There is no mess. This change request was handled appropriately, although veryvery close to the documentation deadline. The problem is work overload ondocumentation in the few days before deadline (they all wait till the last days)and too long turnaround cycles to see the results of any changes in time. So ifa change is not perfect on first try, there is no second chance until the nextversion. This should be addressed.The mess I refer to here is that the change request was made to TechPubs and then the change may not make it into the product. So we're one step ahead (asalways). You're right, this must be addressed in context with the "document based onspecs" paradigm.I didn't mean to blame one of /us/, of course ;-)-> FPE: You will also risk inconsistency between product and help, if you firstmake the changes in the product and afterwards in the help and documentation.The only way to guaranty consistency would be to do the help and documentationchanges within the same CWS as the product fix. Maybe we should try such aprocess change.->IHA: In general, I agree but usually documentation ought to followimplementation and not the other way round. There are still some problems to beovercome regarding the way we best implement help parallel to implementation.Sharing a CWS for feature and help would be one option but poses other issues,one of them being that the help is *big* and would be part of almost all featureCWSs and the majority of bugfix CWSs preparing the ground for conflicts.cannot be fixed for 2.0. retargetedThe UI change will take place not before SO9/OOo3. Help files will be changedfollowing the UI changes. Set target to later.***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***

id=64630	Using the freehand tool to draw into any of OOo's applications is working improper.All sharp edges are smoothed out.This can be seen when trying to draw a rectangle (or the letter 'z') with very sharp corners.This causes a problem when used with a graphic tablet to insert handwriting. Text is smoothed out and unreadable. I think this is more of a defect than an enhancement....Reproducible. Reassigned.AW: Well, the freehand tool is designed to do smoothing, so this is no bug ordefect. Main target group is mouse users, so smoothing is by purpose. When doingsomething with sharp edges like a 'z', the polyline tool should be used, it'sdesigned to produce sharp edges. This should also work with a tablet, just setsingle corner points.Ok, I can understand that the smoothing function works on purpose (though I dislike it, it does not perform well for me), but in that case there should be an option to set the level of smoothing actvity, like inceasing/decreasing and even turning it off, as that would make the tool much more flexible and would introduce a basic handwriting option to OO.

id=1984	When Edit|Changes|Record has been turned on, changed text is displayed in red,deleted text isn actually deleted but shown in strike-through. This information is lost when saving to HTML. I can see no good reason for thatbecause the text becomes unreadable (you don't know what belongs to the old textand what to the revised version).So this is a request to save the information about Changes in HTML export. Reassigned to Falko.This issue is re-assigned to Christian Jansen for further evaluation.Good idea. But an additional feature should be implemented.

This turns on the Changes features4) In the text delete "words" (Notice how it does not delete, but makes "words" with strikethrough).5) Type right after or before "words" the following : "ideas"6) Now save the document and choose format to be .html7) Once you save it, close all OpenOffice and look for the HTML document you just created8) Right-click on the file and choose Open With->OpenOffice9) You should see no color for the changes you made, yet you see "words" and "verses" are still there.Thanks for reporting the bug. I do have one note while doing this is that the color for changed text was not red yet a gold color. This might be due to the build version, but the bug is still there. This bug should be fixed.Thanks for the report.Hope this helpsJose Miranda11/13/2013

id=107734	Windows 7 has a cool little tool for easy input of math formulas: Math InputPanel. It would be great if OpenOffice worked with it. MIP simply puts MathMLobjects in clipboard, so retrieving formulas this way shouldn't be that hard. Reassigned to requirements.@Reporter:Can your solve your problem with the hint on <>?Closing issue due to reporter's inactivity.@reporter:Please feel free to reopen this issue if you find out that the problem still exists in the latest release of AOO and if hints in forum did not help you.The Math Input Panel put varies kinds of MathML into the clipboard. It is a missing feature in AOO, that it cannot be inserted from Clipboard, but Math module can only import MathML via Tools > Import. I think, that "Wontfix" is wrong for a missing feature. If a volunteer wants to implement such feature, that would be OK.The problem is not only with the output of the Math Input Panel, but it is a general problem, that clipboard content can only be inserted as plain text, but a "paste special" for interpreting the content as MathML before inserting it, is missing.(In reply to Rainer Bielefeld from)The suggestions in the thread does not solve the problem.I'm working on it.Creatednot yet ready, but can be testedThe patch adds a new item "Import MathML from Clipboard" to the menu Tools in module Math. If the clipboard has suitable content, for example form the Math Input Panel, then it is converted to StarMath and inserted. If the parser cannot handle the content, then nothing is inserted. The patch needs to be examined by an experienced developer.Please look for coding errors.Please look at the parts in smslots.sdi and in smath.sdi. I have mimic, what I have seen there, but do not really know, what those parts mean. Help and explanations would be nice.I have tested this on Windows 7, but I have no environment to test on Linux or Mac. They have different kind of clipboards, and I do not know, what will happen there.I have foundThis information requires a revision of the changes in smath.sdi and smslots.sdi.Createdimproved encoding handlingImport from clipboard via item in menu should work now.I have not yet tested, to use the new .uno command with the dispatcher in a macro.CreatedVersion including changes to the helpThe attached version works fine for me for Windows. But I have no environment for Linux or Mac. It is important to test it for Linux and Mac, because their clipboard works different from the Windows clipboard. So please, if you have such environment, test the patch.If the clipboard has a content of MIME type "application/mathml+xml" or has a text, which is a MathML source, then the new item "Import MathML form Clipboard" in menu Tools should import it. The result might not be nice or correct, but that is a different problem. If the content cannot be transformed to StarMath, nothing is added to the command window and no error message should appear.On Windows the "Math Input Panel", or MS Word, or the application MathCast produce such clipboard content. I do not know, whether similar application exist on Linux or Mac. Or you copy such content from a Website, or open a .mml file in an editor and copy the source. For Windows there exists the free clipboard viewer "FreeClipViewer" to see the clipboard content. Perhaps similar application exists for Linux or Mac?Please examine the patch and report back. If nobody objects, I'll commit the patch after five days.It worked on Linux environment, Xubuntu 14.04. I used the following to generate mathml.Push "Copy MML" button on the left bottom corner of the window to copy the formula as MathML.Importing from the text contains MathML comming from the clipboard worked. But I could not find the application which push MathML into the clipboard on Linux environment now.So I tried to make one using pyGtk. First I tried to use the following mime-type for MathML: "application/mathml+xml".But it did not work with the mime-type. I needed to change it like: application/mathml+xml;windows_formatname=\"MathML\". Since the function works well with plain text, its not large problem.Here is the code to push MathML data to clipboard using pyGtk. Thanks for the work.The following code require pyGtk.--import pygtkimport gtkclipboard = gtk.clipboard_get()TEXT_MIME_TYPE = 'text/plain;charset=utf-8'MATHML_MIME_TYPE = 'application/mathml+xml;windows_formatname=\"MathML\"'targets = ( (TEXT_MIME_TYPE, 0, 0), (MATHML_MIME_TYPE, 0, 1),)mathml_content = """<math xmlns=""><mfrac><mi>a</mi><mi>b</mi></mfrac></math>"""def get_func(clipboard, selectiondata, info, user_data): print("get_func, info: " + str(info)) if info == 0: clipboard.set_text("text") elif info == 1: selectiondata.set(MATHML_MIME_TYPE, 8, mathml_content)def clear_func(clipboard, user_data): passclipboard.set_with_data(targets, get_func, clear_func, None)# create dummy windowclass MainWindow(gtk.Window): def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs): gtk.Window.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)class App: def main(self): win = MainWindow() win.show_all() gtk.main()App().main()Thank you for looking at it. I will test, whether it still works on Windows when I remove the part ;windows_formatname=\"MathML\"From reading the last section of the following page,The mime-type for MathML is Iana registered one. So it might not need "windows_formatname" in SOT_FORMATSTR_ID_MATHML definition. But I'm not really sure it is.CreatedNow without the part ;windows_formatname=\"MathML\"I have removed the part ;windows_formatname=\"MathML\".The code has a line with a dummy entry and I followed that schema. But perhaps that was only needed for older Windows versions.The attached patch has a lot of whitespace changes, please ignore them. I'll remove them on the final submit. The attached patch replaces the old patch and is not on top of it. So first revert the old one before applying the current.It would be nice, if you can test it again on Linux.After the new patch, both text based and MathML worked well on Xubuntu 14.04 and Xfce.The code incan be like now: MATHML_MIME_TYPE = 'application/mathml+xml'"regina" committed SVNinto trunk:#i107734 Support for Math Input Panel in Windows 7

id=102625	Opening a table for viewing issues a few "select * from table where 0=1" to getthe table metadata. One should be fine but, unless the underlying database has along "ping" (over the net), the extra traffic is not problematic. What is a bigproblem is the "select * from table" followed by as many "select * from tablewhere id='?'" statements as there are lines to display. The first select * isused to get only the primary key or other index. A "select id[,id2,...] fromtable" should do if one does only a SQLGetData on the key field(s). Or..., sinceyou have the select *, use the data that you just retrieved and forget about theselect * where id=?. But not both. Imagine the extra traffic when the tablecontains blobs: they are not displayed in the Table view and are retrieved fromthe database twice... Things get even worse when the ODBC driver, for one reason or another, gets allthe data into the client's memory when SQLExecute is called on the select * fora large table. Here is how ms access is doing it:"Select id from table" followed by a series of "select field1,field2,... fromtable where id=? or id=? or [total of 10 ids] or id=?" to get ten rows at atime. The select where 0=1 is done when you create the link, which is OK for howms access uses linked tables but is in my opinion a minus for ms access.Blobs, Clobs, memos, etc are only retrieved, using a separate select, when thefield is visible in the view. Time to first screen and scrolling speed is muchfaster than for OOO.Overall, the way how OOO handles ODBC databases and what you can do with them isgreat compared to ms Access. Larger tables, especially on networked databases,can however be a show stopper. Replacing the select * by a select ids shouldalready be a big improvement. Ludo Brands same behavior in OOO310m11Same as??Same as?Same as?GrabbingFixed in cws dba34c.Now SELECT * from xx where key = ?will only be called when the view jumps from last to first row.I had a look at the changeset for "dba34c: #i102625# only fetch rows when theview moves outside the scope of the rowset window ". Apparently we are talkingabout different things...When opening a table in a table view, one or more SELECT * FROM table WHERE 1=0is executed. Then a SELECT * FROM table. Then, to fill the form, a number ofSELECT * from xx where key = ?. You addressed a problem with the last part whilethe problem reported is with the second part (the get the complete table). Thecomplete table needs to be traversed to get the key values but there is noreason to get all the data from the table to use only the key values to re-geteverything again one row at the time.

The firstquery is used to provide the key value for the second query. But since all dataare already retrieved why not just fetch them instead of re-querying the tableone row at a time? Or, as MSAccess does, query 1 does a "select keys from xx",and query 2 a "SELECT * from xx where key = ?".If you are interested I can attach an ODBC trace that shows clearly that dataare loaded twice. ODBC traces are lengthy though.The reason why we need the first one is to fetch the complete row. The requeringof a row should now only happen when you move the cursor to a place where thecursor from the rowset already was. The rowset uses a forward only cursor. Thekeyset which is used below the rowset fetch rows by key but only when needed.This I changed. In former versions all rows was refetched even the the cursorfrom the rowset was still valid.So in our case the first fetch like "select * from key = ?" only happen when youmove the cursor to a position where the forward-only cursor from the rowsetalready visited and the position is not in the window (fetch size). A second wayto go would be to check if the cursor from the rowset can be moved back andforward. But history shows that some cursor say "yes we can", but the don't ;-)In my test no call was done for "select * from y where key = ?" when displayingthe table.OK, I see where you are coming from. You need to refetch backward cursorpositions since some drivers don't implement this correctly or lie about it. Soyour fix removed "unnecessary" refetching. As long as you scroll down, thereshould be no refetching. You looked at reducing the "select * from y where key = ?" I look at it from different perspective. I have a problem with the initial"select * from y". Why fetch the full table if you look at the table through awindow (limited number of rows at a time)? Why load blobs or binary data whenthey are not displayed and when you can't do anything with them? No insert, nosave. Opening large tables can be really slow (long time to first display) orsimply impossible due to an out of memory condition (too many rows, blobs, ...).OOO internally is memorywise OK storing only the data for the window displayedbut it forces the driver to fetch the whole lot... An overall minimum memory and bandwidth solution would consist of a "selectkey(s) from y" followed by a series of "select displayable fields from y wherekey(s) = ?". To further reduce bandwidth, replace the "where key(s) = ?" by"where key(s) = ? or key(s) = ? ... or key(s) = ?" to retrieve multiple rows inone go. MSAccess uses a fixed number of rows (10), but obviously a variablenumber (the rows needed to fill the window and not already displayed and notcached in OOO) would be optimal. I'm not going to reopen the issue again as it will be closed by the next replybut you will understand that for me the solution proposed only addresses a smalland minor part of the problem (if there is no out of memory before displayingthe first line...).Please verify. Thanks.repro:- enable ODBC tracing- Open any db with ODBC- Open any table with a primary key- Close OOo- Search for the table name in the log file from ODBC tracing=> There less calls for SELECT * from ....Did anything change from Dec 3? Or is this request just for msc?I did verify the "dba34c: #i102625# only fetch rows when theview moves outside the scope of the rowset window " changes and made mycomments. There are indeed less "select * from y where key = ?". If you onlyscroll forward there are just a few when fetching the last page. That is animprovement. I'm not going to repeat my Dec 6 comments but the main issue is not the "select* from y where key = ?" but the initial "select * from y". Plus, the "select *from y where key = ?" still retrieves blob data while not used in table view.Yes I see your concerns. You are right that this should also be adjusted. So only the first part is fixed. I set it to new again. My problem when thinking of the part with select * fromvsselect vc1,c3,c5,c7 fromI today know that we get problems with some drivers which returns column names which can't be fetched :-( There exists always such drivers, that's what the past 12 years told me :-)Regards,Ockereassign to oj, because he wants to fix somethings.I changed target.

When files are saved as .RTF, the formatting is not saved correctly. The problem can be reproduced by saving any file as .RTF and then re-opening it in OpenOffice. CreatedThis is the original document.CreatedThis is the same document saved as .RTF.It is the same as.*** This issue has been marked as a duplicate of 74236 ***Closing duplicate.I have retested this. The problem is fixed partially, but not completely.The original .ODT file is 1 page long. When I save it as .RTF in 4.0.1 on a Macintosh, it saves as 2 pages but the formatting is now otherwise correct.According to Jonathan's report (), there remains an issue with regard to pagination. I am removing this as a duplicate of #74236, since these individual RTF defects won't be caught if lumped onto #74236. #74236 does not address the problem that is raised with this one.I notice that Latest Confirmation does not allow versions earlier than 4.1.0 now. I trust Jonathan will re-confirm with 4.1.0 or later on MAC OSX.I wonder if the pagination issue with my sample document is the same as that in?(In reply to orcmid from)It will be a while before I can get a chance to do that. Parking ticket in "resolved" status until that happens. (seems thatis the general "RTF problems" bug.)*** This issue has been marked as a duplicate of***This is not the same defect as #49268.#49268 is about opening an RTF file incorrectly, losing the custom tab settings and (sometimes) the page margins. Thisis about whether or not an ODF file is being saved as RTF incorrectly (and that might also be opened incorrectly, but that takes more analysis).In the supplied "document saved as .RTF", there are two defects in the RTF document as confirmed in several different RTF consumers. The individual resume-experience entries are entirely in bold-face, rather than with bold just for the name of the employer. And there were spacing problems causing breaking onto a second page that did not happen with the ODF original.As of Apache OpenOffice 4.1.1, a saved RTF from the original document no longer has the bold-face problem. It continues to have the pagination problem. The pagination problem also occurs when the saved RTF is opened in Microsoft Word 2013 and LibreOffice 4.3, the same as with Apache OpenOffice 4.1.1. Oddly enough, the AOO 4.1.1-saved RTF opens perfectly in Microsoft Windows 8.1 WordPad.The different that causes the pagination problem when the RTF is loaded is in the empty paragraphs that are used for adding blank lines. In the original ODF Text (AOO .ODT) document, those blank lines are set for 10pt Times New Roman. In the RTF, those lines are presented in 12pt Times New Roman, making the blank lines enough higher that the final line of the document breaks onto a second page. This can be demonstrated by viewing the original document side-by-side with a same-zoom view of the 4.1.1-created RTF.CreatedRTF Saved by AOO 4.1.1This is the RTF saved by Apache OpenOffice 4.1.1 from the original ODT document attached to this issue.

What I could imagine is that the actualpaper you are using (21x18, assuming cm that is almost A4) is not found (whichis also the same as before, on Linux 3.2.1 that would have matched to A4 also).In that case nowadays the not matching paper of the document gets centered onthe actual paper.But that's just hypothetical, can you please attach a bugdoc and tell whichprinter you are using ?I'll attach the template that I use.It is with the Epson Aculaser C1100 on Linux. It has an older driver, so that could have influence. But as explained: in3.2.1. andearlier, the problem is not there.Pls note, that in the initial description, I also wrote: " > Same problem when you choose A5 Landscape"Createdtemplate (.ott)Ok, this is not driver dependent, I see it with the generic PostScript PPD(driver). The page size in your template is "22cm x 15.5cm". Which is not C5landscape (which would be 22.9cm x 16.2cm). As I suspected this is a nonprinter paper format that is nowadays centered on the paper that gets actuallyused (which is incidentally C5 since it is the supported format from the PPDthat comes closest). The centering is indeed a change from 3.2, however thatchange was intentional (reasoning that most likely you are going to have abetter result when printing on a paper of the wrong format since there is moreborder space potentially to fill).I found a PPD file for the Epson Aculaser C1100 from here:The printer seems to support C5 as paper but it uses non standard naming. Whichleads to only "A4" and "Letter" being supported by name. More serious: the PPDconstraints Paper format "C5" to Duplex and inputslot "Auto" (the latter ofwhich is at least the default). If you'd not use CUPS to print, you could usethe spadmin utility to set these to ignore. Otherwise I have no goodrecommendation, you could comment out all the fluffy "*UIConstraints" in the PPDfile, but that is not a solution.This is not the first PPD that has some strange UIConstraints. CUPS seems toignore them mostly, so perhaps we should add an option to do that, too.hi phillip,You write "The centering is indeed a change from ..."Do you also see a rotation?Yes I do. That is because if a paper format is not found the search for analternative will also try to match the corresponding landscape format (and viceversa) to find the most appropriate format - which is kind of hard to do sincethe AcuLaser PPD as is only supports Letter and A4.I would not consider that a bug, but you might want a method to switch it off,too ? In retrospect I'd like to have done that in 3.3 since you won't be theonly one trying to use a user format paper to get the job done regardless ofwhat the printer actually supports. For that purpose the new paper matching aswell as the centering is a change for the worse. However 3.3 UI is frozen now.You write: "Yes I do. That is because if a paper format is not found the searchfor an ..."But I do have the same problem when I choose A5 landscape..I may consider A5 a known format ;-)you may consider it known, but the PPD for your printer does not. It knows abouta5, but constraints it such that it is not usable per default. Only Letter an A4are available as such (you can see that e.g. using the spadmin program thatcomes with your OOo).related to issues 112402 / 89289 ?or related to?Why do we have the possibility to make "user-defined" paper-sizes, if all suchpaper-sizes are converted to the printer-driver sizes as A4 and Letter when thepage is printed? Then better to skip the whole option of "user-defined"paper-sizes. I must print cheques that are 21,0 cm wide and 10,2 cm high. Andthat went well with till OOo 3.2.1 with my HP Laserjet 1150, but not anymorewith the new version 3.3. This is a decrease in what can be done with OOo.reading from pl (Wed Aug 4 12:47:06 +0000 2010 ) #desc11"As I suspected this is a nonprinter paper format that is nowadays centered on the paper that gets actuallyused (which is incidentally C5 since it is the supported format from the PPDthat comes closest). The centering is indeed a change from 3.2, however thatchange was intentional (reasoning that most likely you are going to have abetter result when printing on a paper of the wrong format since there is moreborder space potentially to fill)"and from (Thu Aug 5 10:45:54 +0000 2010 ) #desc13" but you might want a method to switch it off,too ?

It was initially "Landscape paper is printed portrait"I suggest default value true, so option checked.

id=58699	I have documents that have the "print date" entered as a field. When thedocument is opened then immediately printed the field is updated i.e. the datehas changed, as you expect and is printed. However if you then close thedocument without saving it just closes - no prompt to save the change.This is a 2.0.0beta regressed bug as it happened during one of them, I forgetwhich, but was fixed sometime before I had a chance to report it, and theproblem is not in the 2.0.0 release. hi taomyn. I've just checked with 2.0.1. RC1 on linux. And yes, OOo behaves as you told. But: this is not a defect, this is a configuration. Go to Tools - Options, OOo -General. Enable printing set "document modified" status. And all should work asexpected.Could you confirm, that your documents would be trigered to save, after enablingthis option?I'll leave this issue open, until i can check with 2.0.1 on windows.BTW.: this option was off by default in OOo 2.0.0 as well. So wihtout settingthis option you documents would not have been triggered to be saved.Sorry, that's not the same thing. My issue is a the "print date" field code thathappens to change on printing, not the act of printing itself, which as it's a"change" should trigger a save request on closing.If I instead used a "time" (not fixed) field code and press save then press F9the save icon lights up again. The same thing should happen when the "printdate" field changes.ok I got it. So we have an incosistent behaviour between:- fields update on request (F9) -> triggers a "document changed"and- automatic field uptade (like after printing) -> does not trigger "documentchanged"accepting this as bug. But lowering priority, as an obvious way exists totrigger "document changed" after printing and OOo 2.0.0 showed exactly the samebehaviour.With 2.0.0 I had to press F9 after printing to trigger the "document changed"status.There's no inconsistency as the option to make the print action a "modification"is not at issue. What is at issue is that when the "print date" field code isautomatically updated after a print it doesn't trigger a change. Like I statedthis worked until I updated to 2.0.1 RC 1 (and RC2 has the same problem - italso broke for a few 2.0.0 beta releases).Setting the general option isn't a valid workaround as I do not want everydocument I print to be treated as printed (I never have). Not all my documentshave the "print date" field code.Reassigned to ES.Still happening with v2.0.1 & v2.0.2 releases and rather infuriating as mydocuments with the "printed date" code aren't remembering when I last printedthem which screws up my audit trail.ES->OS: it worked as described in OOo 2.0Not according to when I logged the fault. Any way regardless of whether itworked or not in v2.x it's still incorrect behaviour or are you defining achange to be only "certain" changes to a document, in which case that's ludicrous!If a field code changes in a document as a result of an action within theapplication, then the document has changed and the application should ask me tosave it when I try to exit. What part of that is not logical!Sorry, you may not like it but it's not a bug at all. As already mentioned you have the choice to switch on the "Printing setsdocument modified status" option.The field 'print date' is not modified. It has no own content - it only displaysthe print date saved at the document. You wouldn't want the document to bemodified every second if you have a 'current time' field, would you?"As already mentioned you have the choice to switch on the "Printing setsdocument modified status" option." - likewise I wouldn't want printing off 100documents to prompt me 100 times to save each one. Stupid example."The field 'print date' is not modified. It has no own content - it onlydisplays the print date saved at the document." - which will never happen unlessyou use the "save as" option - the "save" button remains grey."You wouldn't want the document to be modified every second if you have a'current time' field, would you?" of course not, but the field only updates ifyou refresh/update the document in which case I would want to be prompted as itsa change (which in the case of the "Time" field code it does).It doesn't help to reopen a task if don't like my decision not to fix it. Maybe there's someone who wants to implement it - target changed to OOo PleaseHelpRemoved keyword "needmoreinfo".

id=6386	A special window aacessible from the functions menu where one can enter a formula and this formula is then saved in a category "custom formulas"; this custom formula category then contains a button "modify formula" (or upon displaying the formula it can be edited inline directly !).Also any formula that is entered into the toolbar data field becomes a custom forumla by doing (replacing by) the following which is the principle of custom formulas:Instead of B2, A1 etc. one writes Input1, Input2 and one can use all already existing formulas and all operators.The use of the custom formula is then that calc requires input cells when coming towards applying the function just like any function with arguments requires input cells.eg.: SQRT(Input1^2+Input2^2)=POLARRADIUS //custom formula name (SQRT=square root (exists as formula in english version?))This lists in the category custom functions and is used like any other function in toolbar data field: =POLARRADIUS(A1;B2)or when using the functions menu "wizard" there are displayed two fields for the input data where one then can "enter" the source cells as usual.There it is recommended to be able to comment ones InputX when creating formulas and commenting the formula itself. eg. POLARRADIUS gives the radius of a cartesian coordinate pair in polar coordinates @Falko: Sounds really good to me... Will cause huge effort.@Lars: Just a hint: Until such a functionality may exist, you can useBasic macros. Of course there it is not easy (but possible) to use thebuilt-in sheet functions.on unknown fct, look through all custom functionsif name matches replace entered text by function text,go through function text, replace InputX by entered CellX ,submit this changed text to "function handler" instead of originally entered text.That's problem-reduction.Some work it is to "make" a new category, put a text field for direct editing (like windows filenames) on it etc..i feel slightly bad for being so jackass,perhaps m. dekkers signature fits: it's easy to suggest solutions if one knows nothing about the problem ...how is decision and opinion about this "going along" ?We will not have this in 2.0 (too much effort)Since such function is _very_ specific (and AFAIK whether Quatrro ProExcel don't haveit either) I will put this on later.Set correct state.Reset assignee on issues not touched by assignee in more than 2000 days.
id=18851	In the installation set of the Windows version, add a batch file called "setupnet.bat" containing the line: setup -net ...Simply double clicking this file is a much more convenient way to start the multi-user setup than opening a command prompt, cd-ing to the directory with the installation files, and typing "setup -net". It is also much easier to explain to younger users of Windows, who are unfamiliar with the command prompt (especially the "cd to the directory..." part is difficult to explain).I agree that some such approach would be helpful. Even easier wouldbe to do ask what directory they wanted the temporary installationfiles placed in, then unzipping, then running setup.exe -net or./setup -net and going through the usual steps (on a multi-usersystem, asking for the password would help), then asking if theywanted to run a user installation, pointing out that the folder forthe user installation should be something else and then, exiting outof administrator mode, installing a user system.Complicated as it sounds, it would be a fairly easy .bat or linuxscript file to write and requires no changes in the coding.I think for OOo 2.0 this batch file isn't needed any longer.obsolete with msi style installer.I don't believe this is obsolete and I suggest reopening.Every volunteer who tested the (Italian, in our case) 2.0.1-RCx versions had toperform a "network install" in order not to mess with an existing OOo 2.0.0, asthe default install would have overwritten 2.0.0.The workload to implement this is negligible and this would reduce the NetworkInstall instructions to: "Start the installation, extract files, then Cancel anddouble-click on netsetup.bat".reopenIn OOo 2.x we the parameter /a to have the chance to install an office beside anexisting office.

id=9479	I read the issues,and 7311.I don't think that<<1. Select the text.2. Right click and select the option "Character"3. Choose the "Hyperlink" tab.is a natural way to usefor removing a hyperlink.I found this wayby searching in oo issuesbecause I wanted to saythat we could not suppress an hyperlink.My opinion:- Hyperlink should not be linked (for end-user) to a characters but instead to a group of characters.- Why selecting the text ? Right clicking on the link isn't enought ?I propose a more natural way.Right click on the hyperlink text.Then you get an 'hyperlink' entrybecause text you were on was a hyperlink.Selecting the entry open a dialog boxwhich allows to suppress the link.I put a relative high priorityfor this issuebecause I can't export proper RTFwith hyperlink.Micro$oft Word 97 writes on the placeof the text of the link:"Erreur!

If the problem still happend in 1.1 RC4 please report backI agree, removing a hyperlink actually is not a "natural" way.Additionally, no one will understand why it is impossible to remove ahyperlink from some text by using the hyperlink dialog, as I tied:1. mark text with hyperlink2. click OOo-button "Hyperlink dialogue"3. delete hyperlink target4.

Why does the "ja3cke" pattern work and whyis "a3cke" not enough?I hope Laci can help to you :o)Documentation has fixed at.(There was good documentation only in the standalonehyphenator:.)Thanks for the bug report!nemeth->cloph: In libhnj, Raph Levien has coded a more time-efficient Liang'shyphenation algorithm, as Knuth's implementation. Levien's implementation usesprepared TeX hyphenation pattern, where every embedded subpattern are expandedto left:a3cke is embedded i jacken7tasche, expanded to left: ja3cke.See documentation of the libhnj library (or standalone version of AltLinuxlibhnj hyphenator)..Hmm. I cannot find anything describing the algorithm there - but at least theinstructions on how to create a hyphenation dictionary have been clarified.Hmm - I cannot find an updated description of the algorithm either. Or better onhow it differs from the one described in the README.It still reads "The hyphenation algorithm is basically the same as Knuth's TeXalgorithm. However, the implementation is quite a bit faster."It states that it needs a preprocessing step, but doesn't explain why.And it still shows the pattern-matching example of the TeX-algorithm.Hmm. I guess that is exactly what I want to have added to the documentation,although I don't quite understand it yet. Maybe you could try to explain inother words what is meant by "expanded to left".I think here is one part of the things that start to confuse me. If it isalready embedded, why has it to be added explicitly again?Does the algorithm only use the "biggest junk" that fits (and only one singlepattern), starting from the left?ja3cke fits one more letter on the left of the pattern (two, the "j" and the"a") whereas a3cke only matches one ("a")?When there is no ja3cke but onlya3cke andjacken7taschethen still Jacke would be compared against the "jacken7tasche" pattern *only*(since it matches more letters beginning from the left), but since it doesn'tcontain a digit, it won't be hyphenated?On the other hand, when I have the patternsa3cke and cken7tascheeverythink would be hyphenated as expected since now the a3cke is applied sinceit matches "earlier" in the string (second letter instead of third)?If I have botha3cke andacken7tascheAre both applied like in the original implementation or what is the case here?Is the crucial part the number of matched letters before the digit or from the left?From a test with the pattern:ISO8859-1ack7entaschecken7taschen$ ./example hyphtestpat JackeJack-entascheJack-en-taschencompared to the patternISO8859-1ack7entaschecken7tasche$ ./example hyphtestpat JackeJack-entascheJack-entaschenIt seems that not only the left-side is what matters, but also the right side.So ist my sketch of the algorithm completely wrong and both the left andright-hand letters count?i.e. if one patterm matches 7 letters, the other one 5, then only the one with 7matching letters is applied? If both have 5 matches, both are applied?But again this cannot be the case since otherwise "Jacken" would not have beenhyphenated with the patternISO8859-1a3ckejacken7tascheja3cke(jacken7tasche still has one match more) - why is "jacken" not hyphenated withthe very fist pattern? (without "ja3cke") - does it really match the longer one?Please point me to the file. I couldn't find that description in the zip. (I'mnot looking for a description on how to create the hyphenation dictionary, buthow the algorithm uses the patterns) - therefore I reopen this one.nemeth->cloph: See "Theory of the algorithm" section in the README.hyphen, plussubstrings.pl and hyphen.c. Substrings.pl makes an unification process, too:./substrings.pl jacke jacke.2ISO8859-1 is embedded in ISO8859-1+ISO8859-1ack7entasche is embedded in ack7entasche+ack7entaschecken7tasche is embedded in ack7entascheackentasche includes ckentasche at pos 1ack7entasche + cken7tasche -> ack7en7taschecken7tasche is embedded in cken7tasche+cken7tasche[altlinuxHyph]$ cat jacke.2ISO8859-1ack7en7taschecken7tasche[altlinuxHyph]$ ./example jacke.2 <(echo Jackentasche)Jack-en-tascheI think so. Please, remove the "no" in the #define noVERBOSE line of hyphen.c,and look at the work of the algorithm.Regards,LaciI was afraid of an answer "read the code" :-(I cannot understand the code and apparently the wording in the readme is notclear to me.I don't understand what is meant by "finite state machine" and I have problemswith the term "transition" as well. Is one of the pattern a transition? And howdoes a transition "consume" an input letter?I was hoping to get an explanation of the algorithm with some examples, justlike Knuth's algorithm is easily explained given the example.It wasn't clear to me that "Theory of the algorithm" explains theOOo-hyphenation mechanism either. I always thought it is a "technical"explanation of Knuth's algorithm. (As I've written, I don't understand thelanguage used therein). It is not obvious that these are different things.##################So if you don't want / cannot provide an "easy to understand/read" explanation,then please at least add a prominent note that it is not Knuth's algo that isbeing used, but a rather significant modification that is explained in the"tech-talk" below the description of the TeX-Algorithm.nemeth->cloph: Liang's general hyphenation algorithm has two differentimplementations (optimized versions of the original algorithm), one of D. E.Knuth and one of Raph Levien. There is Knuth's algorithm closer to Liang's one,than Levien's algorithm, but Levien's algorithm is only a clever implementationof the original Liang's algorithm, too.Raph Levien has made a mistake in the README, the `easy' explanation is aboutthe original Liang's algorithm. (OK, Liang was a PhD student of D. E. Knuth.See Liang's thesis:)Also TeX use Liang's hyphenation algorithm (perhaps by Knuth's implementation,I don't know):I will add a reference to Liang's thesis in the source. Will be OK?Regards,Laci***has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. ***
id=59485	The canvas needs to display the columns from right to left if the locale is setto Hebrew, Arabic or Syriac. ie, cell A1 is displayed in the top-right cornerinstead of the top-left. This is an extremely serious issue for users of OO inRTL languages because of formatting of speadsheets coming from excel. Example:They have their speadsheets set up to use columns A->E,F,G... but beingdisplayed RTL instead of LTR. When opened in OO calc, the columns showup as LTR.Suggested fix:When the locale is set to hebrew, Arabic or another RTL language, displaycolumns as RTL, hopefully the navigation system will not have to be reversed.Cheers,Ben according toI reassign this issue to requirements and set the status to newThis is an independent setting. Use the context-menu of the table-sheet's label(the one next to the horizontal scrollbar) and set the table to right-to-left mode.Worksforme.closing issue. Feature already present and working.Make sure you enable support for CTL in Tools|Options â†’ Language settings,otherwise you won't be offered the option to make the table right-to-left.Thanks for the worksforme.However, from a usability point of view, if the locale is set to Hebrew, Arabic,or Syriac, it's logical that the table default to right-to-left. Just becausethe user can set the table RTL manually doesn't mean that they should have to iftheir locale is a RTL language.Cheers,BenDUP of?

It is necessary, instead, to introduce an updated redistributable library and probably build a new binary release of Apache OpenOffice.org.** I disagree that there is insufficient information in this bug report. However, this is very difficult to reproduce. A new build with the latest library versions should be made and the reporting party asked to determine whether installing the new build cures the problem.

id=126384	Edit -> Fill not only fills the numbers in cells but also copies starting cell's color to other filled cells. This is the normal behaviour. Why do you expect anything other?The respective help topics speaks often about numbers but sometimes also of cells. So, IMHO it's not clear that complete cells - incl. formatting - will be used for filling.However, I don't see this as a real bug but more as an enhancement - e.g., to make it optional to use more than the cell content. Herefore I'm reopening this issue.Fill should only fill numbers. You can use Copy to copy formats. I had a column that I remarked cells with colors. When I filled that column, all colors were gone. Help only mentions options for filling numbers.(In reply to jteera5 from)This is your special case. I think most users want the actual behaviour because in the majority of cases equal content should have equal/same formatting especially for filling with Sort Lists.For your special case there are different solutions. Only 2 as example:1. copy the cells before filling the row and after that insert only the formats.2. Use a separate column for marking the row and create a Conditional Formatting which dye the cells in the marked row.Maybe the help could be more clear for this feature.But this enhancement wish should also provide how this feature could be extended without changing the default/actual behaviour. Maybe this could be solved better as an installable extension.
id=112829	This bug happens in Ubuntu Lucid, with OOo 3.2Repro:1. Fire up OOo Calc2. Type in a few numbers3. Insert a bar chart showing those numbers4. Select the bar chart5. Copy it to the clipboard6. Try to paste it into e.g. GIMPResult:GIMP says there's nothing on the clipboard and refuses to paste.Expected result:I should be able to paste a bitmap of my chart into GIMP and save it from there. GNumeric can do this even, I expect this to "just work". Can paste graph in Paint using Rev. 1499775 Win 7.If GIMP refuses to paste it has a problem.Closed this bug as FIXED and not as NOTABUG because till recently graph pasted incorrectly even within suite showing only area without data.My conclusion was premature.Values are incorrect.Createdpasted graphpasted graph with wrong numerical valuesCreatedoriginal dataCreatedauxilliary fileauxiliary file needed due to vlookup function in original dataALG: Opening file fromasks for updating links to another file (probably file from), requires password for file 'File2.ods', please add password.The original task is about getting a *bitmap* image in an external paint program when copy/pasting a chart, not about copying the chart between apps of AOO4.0.Copy/Pasting between apps in AOO4.0 is #120559#.To check for copy/paste between AOO4.0 apps I will need the password for file 'File2.ods'.Copy/pasting with gimp is not reliable; I found myself some time ago that the clipboard support of gimp is varying from version to version, thus it is better to check with various graphic apps.On win I checked:- copy/pasting from Writer /test file from) to paint.net -> works well- to gimp2.8 -> not directly from Writer, but as workaround it's possible to copy/paste to Draw/Impress, convert to bitmap there and copy/paste to Gimp.- to MyPaint: Same as for Gimp.Original bug is questionable: Is it intended to copy a chart from Writer to an external pixel program directly? It is possible from Draw/Impress directly, all others should get the chart first copied to Draw/Impress as workaround.ALG: Using Paint from win7 directly (as reference for clipboard functionality): The chart can be directly copied from all apps (also checked that copying the chart from test doc fromto all other apps, works well without data loss). The question for other external paint programs is more what clipboard formats these support, AOO offers something useful in all cases.password is scooter.File is related to some other bug I reviewed, sorry.ALG: Hi Edwin, thanks for the password, but - it does not work. It says 'the password is incorrect'. Please check with 'File1.ods'.I check and recheck - scooter, like the famous German band :)ALG: Edwin, I may be too lame to type that, but I cannot open 'File1.ods' fromusing 'scooter' as password. What's going on ;-)CreatedFile 1 no passwordThis is strange...Only scooter opens the file.This attachment is just save as without password.ALG: Thanks Edwin, can open now. Still strange, and after load and update, the value '13' is not shown in the chart. After activating and toggling dataRanges/DataSeriesInRows and back to Columns it gets visible, a refresh problem...?copy/pasting in calc or to new app does not lose any data (thus #120559# was successful), but changes the data labels on the Y-Axis from simple values to date format. Is that what you mean with 'wrong numerical values'? If yes, please check if we have a task for this or create a new one. This can also be reproduced by creating a chart as this newly just with fixed values and copy/pasting it.- Does not happen in OOo3.3- Does not happen in OOo3.2Back to this task: I checked on mac; I do not know what app to use as standard regarding clipboard implementation, but it can be copied to some apps. The workaround converting to graphic is always possible.(In reply to Armin Le Grand from)Yes - openedAdditional Info:---------------(a) The original report was concerning a copy/paste problem of Charts to Gimp. That never worked for me with OOo back to 1.1.5(b) As Edwin stated, that might be a Gimp problem.

id=126482	went to windows 10 now all files open in read only There is already an issue with problems that maybe results from an upgrade to Windows 10. So, I'm closing this one.*** This issue has been marked as a duplicate of***** NOTE ** This is not necessarily the only way that a Windows 10 Upgrade may interfere with use of OpenOffice (and other applications).There are two prospective remedies when documents suddenly become read-only after upgrade to Windows 10. These cases have nothing to do with OpenOffice directly, but appear to be side-effects of the update in the case of Windows 10 Home. We want you to be a successful user and are interested in providing the resolution for those who notice this problem in conjunction with their use of Apache OpenOffice.TRY THIS FIRSTThis is the simplest case. 1. In Windows 10, go into "Settings" a. At the end of the desktop task bar, next to the Window icon, enter "Settings" into the search entry field. (If you do not have a search entry field in the task bar, click the round icon next to the Window icon, then use the field at the bottom of the pane that pops open.) b.
