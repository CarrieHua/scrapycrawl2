id=30904	LibreOffice 3.3.0 OOO330m9 (Build:1)libreoffice-build 3.2.99.2Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx)Also filed in Debian bug tracker August 8 2010: #594120 (openoffice.org-calc: Function Wizard omits sheet reference)Much simpler way to reproduce this in Calc:-Click Function Wizard-Double-click ABS function-Select Sheet2.A1Function Wizard enters =ABS(A1:A1) and Calc returns Err:522Expected:Function Wizard to enter =ABS(Sheet2.A1) and Calc to return 0.For me the severity is critical because it stops me from working efficiently. I use the Function Wizard daily to build formulas on complex multi-sheet files. But, I can revert to Beta1 where this bug does not appear to exist. Yes, this needs to be fixed. Thanks for reporting this. I'll look into this sooner rather than later.Found the cause & fixed it on master. This will be fixed in the next release.Verified in 10_10_28_Cedric.rpm build - Closing - SophieThis is a Calc issue, therefore changed 'Component' field accordingly.Set Version according to original description.
id=30861	Problem occurs with LibreOffice Betas 1 and 2 loading a specific spreadsheet which crashes the programme. The loading progress bar indicates "Adapt row height" when it crashes.This problem only occurs with the LO betas. OO.org and NeoOffice have never had problems with the particular spreadsheet.Thanks. I would guess this problem is not specific to MacOS - Peter, would you be able to share your document privately, then Kohei could have a look?(In reply to)Thanks for your response. Unfortunately the spreadsheet document contains confidential data so am unable to share it. I will install LibreOffice on a Windows PC and re-test the document.Will post the outcome.(In reply to)Understood. But without the actual document it'll be hard for us to debug. Could you cleanse the document to remove all your confidential info and send it to me privately to my email address?(In reply to)Email with attachment sent.PeterThanks for your test document. I've reproduced this on my end, and I'll look into this pronto!This is now fixed on master, for 3.3.(In reply to)Thanks. That's great news.When will compiled update be available?(In reply to)We are not 100% sure yet, but our best estimate would be somewhere in the neighborhood of the next 2 to 3 weeks.I don't have the doc to test, but closing the issue as there is no further comments for the reporter. Reopen if needed :) SophieThis is (at least at the surface) a Calc issue, therefore changed the'Component' field accordingly.Added version according to original description and summary.

id=32250	I test LibO for MS-Windows on a VM XP with only 4 GB virtual hard-disk. I have about 700 MB of free space. There was no problem to install beta 1,2 and 3.There is something wrong.For me, if LibO requires so much of free space, it is a blocker: I can't test LibO anymore on XP. You need a bigger disk.(In reply to)No! It worked well until this RC1. I guess there is a bug in the installer.End users will not understand how it is possible to have a lighter office suite which require ~4 times than OOo of free space on the hard disk to install.What has been changed in this installer since beta3 ?Best regards. JBFFridrich, others, could we do anything with it? 1500MB sounds too much to me.Note that it has been nominated as 3.3 blocker.Duplicate of???(In reply to)Installation worked fine on the same machine and HD for beta2. So I guess there is a bug in the computation of the amount of needed free space.It's mostly pointless to compare the disk space used by betas and release candidates, when there are changes going on that greatly affect the size of the installer, and the amount of disk space used during the installation. Nobody is claiming that the beta 2 and the rc1 would be very like each others. Of course there are changes.Yes, this is a duplicate of. But as this bug seems to have more excited commenters, let's resolve that one as a duplicate of this one instead, even if that is not really logical.I still think it is ridiculous to try to run a Windnows installation and expect to be able to install any significant software on a 4 GB disk.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***(In reply to)Hmmm, not very fair and friendly your comment :-(My XP is on a virtual machine with nothing other than LibO or OOo. I am using this machine for QA tests. That worked fine for years until this RC1. Are you sure that there is not a bug in the *computation* of the needed free space ?If you compare the size required during installation of an OOo installer that contains just one UI language to that required during the installation of a LibreOffice multi-language installer, it should not come as a surprise that the latter requires more space.I have discussed it with Fridrich and Michael. The 3.3-rc1 installer really needed 1500GB. It compressed the files twice to reduce the download size. The result was that the files were duplicated once more on the disk during the installation.Fridrich told me that they found another solution and there should be less disk space need for the upcomming 3.3-rc2. It should be more comparable with 3.3-beta3.I would consider this bug as fixed. Feel free to reopen it if you are not happy with 3.3-rc2.Really mark as fixed.Hi Jean:Sadly so - for RC1 :-) With the WinShrink branch, as of now I expect it to be ~900Mb, and we are working on shrinking that further - though how much further is unclear to me (thus far).HTH.A breakdown of the uncompressed space is:As you see, ~20% of the size is duplicate licenses (still).***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Fridrich removed yet more duplicated licenses, which should help some more; we still have the wizards / templates bulking us up - but this requires rather more development work to straighten out I'm afraid.Either way - the expectation is that the net result of this is a substantially reduced disk usage for RC2 - and going forward to 3.4 there is lots more scope for shrinkage.Hi,Installation of rc2 without problem on my VM XP ! You have done a great job. Thanks.JBFThanks for the encouragement ! :-) it really makes life sweeter - anyhow there is lots more space to be saved in the multi installer, but hopefully 3.4 will give us some more wins just in the course of business around artwork eg.Closed - Sophie

id=33134	I can see the UI drawing in Win32 this happened in rc1 but fixed in rc2 now it is back. Can`t remember the other bug entry so I fill this one.Menus are slow in all aplication of libreoffice and the overall libreoffice it is slow. This happened in rc1 fixed in rc2 , what happened this time ?A fast fix and repost of a binary build of rc3 with this fixed will be nice.Now i can`t use LibreOffice rc3 for nothing in win32. Uninstalled RC3 and installed RC2 for testing again.LibreOffice RC2 menu speed it is like under 5 max 10 ms or so , i can`t even see when all the menus are drawn.Uninstalled RC2 installed RC3 on same machine and the menu speed it is likeLibreOffice RC3 menu speed it is like 1 second lag i can see on the menus when i move the cursor that the "blue select" thing goes with a 1 second and more lag behind not under my cursor and some menus looks not drawng for a second then are drawn.Don`t like that to slow.Duplicate of?(In reply to)Yeah it is the same but looks they have not tested the RC2 forth and back to see this bug more clearly that the RC2 behave normaly and fast.It must be reverted to the behavior of RC2.Looks more like some debug is on or something else.Reported this one long time ago on IRC (2010..) channel when i was testing LibreOffice beta 2 until rc1 if a remember well and compared with OpenOffice speed at that time so. Looks like a very old bug for me cause i spoted first and everytime I look for this bug when i open LibreOffice.I installed LibreOffice RC2 now until RC3 will be fixed to work the same.*Note LibreOffice RC2 works like other apps in Windows Vista in speed comparation like IE8,Explorer speed near same.I know for last time i found this bug that on Linux platform it is not present and neither MAC (some said that on irc) at that time in 2010.I think it is no need to retest from alpa to rc3 all the builds for windows when RC2 works flawless.Thanks for your work chasing this down ! it is a duplicate though, so marking as such so we can make the other a blocker :-)*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***

It can also be helpful to export (File -> Save) the PML file to a CSV file and load it into an editor that can sort and search by column.I see a few things that look strange to me in the .PML file Jonathan linked to, on the other hand, I have never used ProcMon to debug LibreOffice (only OpenOffice.org), and what I'm seeing might be normal for LibreOffice, and especially for the v3.4. For one thought however, see my next comment.Could the users who are seeing this problem (or a related problem) try the following:1. Run LibreOffice to confirm the problem.2. Close LibreOffice.3. If the LibreOffice Quickstarter is running, right-click on the LibreOffice Quickstarter icon in the system tray and select "Exit Quickstarter".4. Run taskmgr (Start -> Run -> type "taskmgr" and hit Enter).5. Verify that there are no processes running with names that start with "soffice" (such as "soffice.exe" or "soffice.bin").6. Navigate to your user setting directory (open the Windows File Explorer, type %APPDATA$ in the location bar and hit Enter).7. You should see a subfolder called "LibreOffice". Rename this subfolder to something else, like "LibreOffice-save".8. Run LibreOffice and check to see if the problem is still occurs.If the problem is still there, do the following if you are running Vista or Windows 7; otherwise, skip to Step 14 below:9. Repeat Steps 2-6 above, and then:10. In your user settings directory, delete the subfolder named LibreOffice.11. Navigate to your VirtualStore folder, which is at C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\VirtualStore.12. Look in all subfolders for any subfolders named "LibreOffice" or "LibreOffice 3", and if you find one, delete it.13. Run LibreOffice and check to see if the problem is still occurs.If the problem is still there:14. Repeat Steps 2-6 above, and then:15. In your user settings directory, delete the subfolder named LibreOffice.16. Uninstall LibreOffice.17. Delete the folder named "LibreOffice 3" in the Windows programs directory (either "C:\Program Files\LibreOffice 3" or "C:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 3", depending on whether you are running a 32 bit or 64 bit version of Windows).18.

I haven't had time to try steps 14-20 yet.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***- Canât open files confirmed several details in the comments here ("The memory could not be "read"").To recount the history of this bug report:1. Zack opened this bug report (#3671), stating that he was getting the error message "General input/output error" whenever he attempted to run Writer, either with a new blank document or an existing document.2. Someone else came along and said they were getting the error message "General error, memory could not be read" whenever they attempted to open a document in Writer. Based on their bug, that person changed the title of this bug report to "FILEOPEN impossible, General error, memory could not be read" 3. In response to Action #2 above, Zack opened a new bug report (#36375) that restated his initial bug report, with his original title.Action #2 above was wrong and should not have been done. It confused two different error messages (one an error in input/output and the other an error reading memory) that occur at two different times (one when trying to run Writer, and one when trying to open an existing document in Writer).At this point, I agree with Zack that this issue thread is hopelessly confused. I suggest closing this issue as a duplicate and then following up on Zack's issue at his new bug report #36375, and the other bug at whatever bug number is created for it.I agree with Allen inthat this bug report is now quite confusing and should be closed. Anyway, the problem where attempting to open ODF documents failed with a useless "General input/output error" message had the same root cause as, so that problem is fixed now, even more reason to resolve this bug report.Could bugzilla_acct_1959 please tell more what kind of document he/she/it was trying to open?The crash when quitting LibreOffice is another thing, not related to the file opening problem. I wish people would spend as much time on producing useful bug reports that don't mix in different problems as they do on coming up with clever email addresses for bugzilla.

id=36375	CreatedScreenshot of error messageI try to open writer and I get this error message:General Error.General input/output error.It doesn't matter if I try to start writer from the startcenter (as shown in the screenshot) or I manually try to open swriter.exe, I get the same error message. This bug was originallybut that has morphed into the bug which deals with opening files. Either way, they are related as the same error message occurs.I tried the instructions as proposed by Allen inwhich read:(In reply to)Step 7 solves the problem and allows writer to run. However, upon exiting LO (doesn't matter what component is running) soffice.exe crashes every time.Hope some of this helps! I still suspect that "- FILEOPEN impossible, General error, memory could not be read"has the same rootsThat is a different bug and IMO should be handled on a different thread. It might be the same as the "Error reading memory" that others are reporting.OK, there is something in your %APPDATA%\LibreOffice folder that is preventing Writer from running. I have no idea what that might be though, and just to warn you, tracking down the specific item might be about ten times more work than you've expended so far. If you have the time though, it might be helpful if you close LO (Steps 1-5 of the troubleshooting procedure I posted), delete your new %APPDATA%\LibreOffice folder and then rename your defective folder %APPDATA%\LibreOffice-save back to %APPDATA%\LibreOffice. Then attempt to run Writer and confirm you are getting the bug. Finally, follow my procedure on your earlier bug report #36271 to generate a ProcMon dump file, upload that file somewhere and post a link where I can download it and take a look.Zack, Tor's recent comments on a number of different bugs indicate that some serious and potentially related problems in LO v3.4 Beta 1 have already been fixed. Given the level of effort that would be required to track down the specific source of your problem, as well as a availability of a work around (deleting the %APPDATA%\LibreOffice directory), I think it would make sense at this point to wait for a LO v3.4 Beta 2 release and see if that resolves this problem, before attempting to troubleshoot further.I cannot reproduce this problem in a fresh install of a fresh build of the libreoffice-3-4 branch.probably is useful, there might be something in your user-specific settings that causes the problem. Do you think you could zip up the %APPDATA%\LibreOffice folder and attach to this bug? Please check that nothing confidential gets included.(In reply to)I'm going to wait for Beta 2. Based on the error message I agree that this may be related toas well.(In reply to)This only occurs when attempting the workaround of deleting/renaming the %APPDATA%\LibreOffice folder.I will close this bug for now and await the Beta 2. If the problem resurfaces I'll reopen and attach the contents of my %APPDATA%\LibreOffice folder and we can go from there.Thanks for all the hard work!This has been fixed in Beta 2.Remove infoprovider from closed and resolved bugs.RESOLVED, FIXED or CLOSED bugs cant be KEYWORD NEEDINFO.
id=36437	It is very important that our community members could test the nightly builds without any risk for the productive user / profile. I tested one of this builds with my current user and get issues with the user profile. It doesn't work correctly with my LibO 3.3.x anymore. In my case it affected an extension (the Presenter Console) and I was only aware of this issue, because I had to give a presentation about LibreOffice (and use the second monitor).Because of such possible side effect I propose a different namespace and a different profile for the nightly build (like in the OOo project). We should name it more interesting, e.g. LibO-future. We need more people who install and use the development builds on their desktops, so that we could get feedback early and often, if something went wrong within the code. Good idea, can we expect you to help in implementing that?@Tor: I can test it, but I can't implement it. I'm working currently on another important sub-project for LibO and have no time to examine, where the necessary changes had to be done.There should not be anything necessary except to not build the openoffice targets, but the openoffice-dev targets in instsetoo_native/utili.e.ALLTAR : openofficedev_$(defaultlangiso) ooolanguagepackdev $(eq,$(OS),MACOSX $(NULL) ooohelppackdev)instead of the defaultALLTAR : openoffice_$(defaultlangiso) ooolanguagepack $(eq,$(OS),MACOSX $(NULL) ooohelppack)As building dev-versions is the more usual task, the dev-named variant should be made the default, and the non-dev variant be activated with --enable-release or something.Anyway, to check whether the building of dev variant works for libreoffice, or whether there needs to be changes needed, build LO, and after regular building, source the environmentfile, cd instsetoo_native/util and run dmake openofficedev_en-US - this should produce the libreoffice-dev version of the installer.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Changed "Nightly" to "Developer" as this applies to beta as well as nightly builds.This topic is not only important for our community members, but for our marketing and public recognition too.If we want external people to test our release-early / release-often cycle, installing a test/daily/beta version should not lead to deinstallation of the version of LibreOffice they use for productive work. Similar problems might happen to their user profiles.We can't expect an average user to set up a virtual machine or create a test user account to avoid such interaction. We got negative public feedback on our first Beta, now it's the same for the present Beta. If we can't change the product's behavior in short time, we should modify our website to describe different installation processes for final releases and developer/tester builds.Developers: Please check if this topic qualifies for an "Easy Hack" - and if nobody considers it to be important enough to work on it, tell us, so we can modify our website (perhaps leading to less testers, but to less negative feedback as "premature project" too).All: Do you think this topic is worth to be linked to the "most annoying bugs" ()?This issue by its very nature only affects developer builds, so I don't think it would make any sense to set it to block a stable release.I patched openoffice.lst in master, so openofficedev target does not want to package JRE any more.I built dev versions (en-US only) on Windows and on Linux without problems.The --enable-release configure switch is yet to be implemented.This is not a medium priority enhancement request. It is essential for developer builds to be installable alongside stable versions to allow the product to be tested. Setting a more appropriate importance.And since when does an anonymous bugzilla commenter get to decide?In master I introduced a new switch to configure: --enable-release-buildDefault is dev build with dev prefixes all around.For 3.4 we'll not have more betas (or will we?) so I would not disturb that branch.It'd be great to have it already for 3.4!I assume many many people out there beeing keen to install the 3.4 prerelease to satisfy their couriousity and to give feedback about issues they encounter.As 3.4 from my point of view, is widely considered the very first child of genuine libreoffice development. This way we might profit from more eyes power resulting in a more refined release.One more thank You for the great work done so far.FriedrichWhy is this marked RESOLVED FIXED? LO 3.4 beta 4 still overwrites previous versions.I don't remember specifically where - but someone has added a note that installing LO 3.4 beta 4 will replace earlier installations. So we are being warned at the moment. The next issue might be how a user can see in their application menu which version is stable and which is not - most places in Windows and Linux the version is not usually mentioned, just the application name. It might be good to have some visual indication on the application icons. This is especially relevant with Widnows / and the Ubuntu Unity desktop encouraging keystroke launching of application. Just my thoughts on this.Thanks for the great progress LO has already made - I've noticed a few silly things disappear which bugged me about OOo.This process will not be used for 3.4[.0] - the next build is already planned to be a rc = release candidate, and those are supposed to behave exactly like the final version, thus you would have had a dev-build just for one single build, and that would be confusing at best.for the next releases, the dev-builds will be used and hence will make it much easier for testers/QA/interested users to follow the nightly builds/start earlier with QA for the release without having to worry about removal of the stable version.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***

id=36551	It's not possible (without dirty tricks) to update a 3.3.2 installation of LibreOffice to the 3.4.0beta2, because of unfortunate naming of packages.There are versioned package names, that install files to non-versioned directories.both core as well as extension packages are affected. For example/opt/libreoffice/program/kdefilepicker is in package "libreoffice3.3-core01" and"libreoffice3.4-core01"As both have a different name, the libreoffice3.4-core01 is not considered an update of libreoffice3.3-core01, thus rpm as well as dpkg try to install the 3.4-0beta2 one alongside of the 3.3.2 one, and of course fails because both packages include the same files (the same filepaths)It's a bad idea to have versioned package names when they use a non-versioned directory. The only way to do a clean update in this case is to add tons of "Obsoletes" statements in all affected packages.#########################################################Two ways to solve this dilemma1) Allow packages to installed along each other (except the desktop-integration one - you have to decide which version should be in your DE's menu, what should be default for the corresponding mime-types)In this case, make the installation directory versioned as well. /opt/libreoffice3.4/..... for example2) Have 3.4.0 be an update to previous version(s)In this case remove the version from the package names, and add a corresponding Obsoletes: <packagename>3.3 to the packages(or put a hard break to it without adding Obsoletes-directive and make manual uninstallation of previous versions mandatory for the users by putting it in big letter to the release notes)(note that neither of the above is a replacement for special development versions that can always be inside alongside release(candidate) versions likerequests) ***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***This is IMO a duplicate of[- broken debian files ]No, 31747 is no duplicate.

I.e. that it should be possible for the user to *choose* whether to install 3.4 in parallel with an earlier LO installation, or whether to let it overwrite/override it? That will be quite hard to implement on Windows at least, without actually providing two separate sets of installers for two completely separate products, one which is a new version of the LibreOffice product, one which is a new LibreOffice3.4 product.(In reply to)DoneNote that even the desktop integration packages can be installed installed in parallel. Everything is versioned, including desktop menu entries and the libreoffice3.4 wrapper.There was a long discussion and it is not easy to do this for Windows. Though, we decided to produce non-conflicting daily builds using tinderboxes for Windows (so called dev builds).

I have created another sample document with two charts. It opens new temp files every time I go down or up the page.The temp files are binary files starting with the text "VCLMTF".

JBFI built the latest libreoffice-3-4 which shows the problem, then I downgraded -only- the 'sc' module to libreoffice-3-4-0 and the problem is gone.Ergo at least the exacerbating cause of the issue is in the 'calc' repository (which includes chart2 of course) between libreoffice-3-4-0 and libreoffice-3-4-1.

id=46105	Createdmoment of crash during startupI use Win7 in english, and installed LibreOffice 3.5 final release in german. I had installed ver 3.4.5 in german before which worked well. The standard install succeeded without any errors. But when I start LO from the desktop icon I reach the crash (tried it a dozen times). And rebooting the pc won't help either. I also tried to repair and deinstall LO but still got the same error. I never selected the danish dictionary and also tried to delete it from the disk, but still the same crash. I have Java SE 7.02 installed.Uninstall LibreOffice, then delete C:\Program Files\LibreOffice 3.5. Reinstall. Does it work for you?*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***
id=46140	CreatedWindows crash logProblem description: Every time I update LibreOffice, for a while I continue to get a "LibreOffice has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience." error whenever I try to open a file with it. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't make a difference, nor does removing the PDF import extension. The problem usually fixes itself after a while but returns when I update again. The crash log is attached. (Possibly related to?)Steps to reproduce:1. Install LibreOffice2. Associate LibreOffice with documents, spreadsheets, and presentations3. Try to open a document.Current behavior:LibreOffice begins to load, but once the loading bar reaches halfway or so and the window reads "Enabling Danish spelling dictionary, hyphenation rules, and thesaurus" (which is odd because I only have the English dictionary installed), LibreOffice crashes and I get the error described above.Expected behavior: LibreOffice should open the document.Platform (if different from the browser): Windows XP Pro SP3 Browser: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0C) I resolved the problem by doing a clean uninstall of LibreOffice using Revo Uninstaller, which means that some files were being left over and not overwritten from a previous version I had installed. I would assume they existed in the \Program Files\LibreOffice 3.5\ folder.*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***

The document indoes not seem to get truncated for me. However, libreoffice just truncated my ~22 pages document to seven pages. I believe I cannot share the .docx file, unfortunately.I am not familiar with the .docx format but it appears that after unzipping it and stripping all the markup from word/document.xml, most of the text is still kind of there. Meanwhile, other .docx consumers refuse to open the file at all.Ignore me, I think I wanted #55820Hi all, while I see some odd behavior and slight differences when comparing the test document in Word2010 and LO 4.2.0.1 pages are the same amount.Next I tried resaving to a new docx file. Then compared the two LO files (existing docx and newly created docx from test file), they are identical.Thus setting to WORKSFORME.I know similar issues do appear occasionally but with 4.2.0.1 and this test file it seems to no longer happen, so I suggest, if any of you run into a similar problem please make sure to create a new bug and we can start a new investigation of what's going on.this problem is still in versions 3.5A 29 pages .docx file saved with that extension and reopened only includes 7 pagesChecked in 4.4.1.2No Problems(In reply to Salvador from)Version 3.5 is obsolete. It would be different, if you would see the problem in versions 4.3.6 to 4.4.1.Setting back to WFM per other comments in 2015.

Thanks in advance.(In reply to)That is the real problem. Files not present in manifest are ignored when an extension is registered. So, as far as libreoffice is concerned, the reportbuilder has no configuration files...The old build system allows to have a skeleton manifest for an extension that is then filled by a perl script (solenv/bin/makemani.pl) during build (which is something I overlooked at the time I did the conversion). We either need to duplicate that functionality in gbuild or fill all the necessary entries in.git grep COMPONENT_MANIFEST_GENERIC says there is no other extension that uses makemani.pl to create the manifest for it. (And git log -SCOMPONENT_MANIFEST_GENERIC says reportbuilder was the only extension that had ever used it.)

id=53854	CreatedThe corrupted database fileProblem description: When working with a Base database using LO 3.6.0.4, after saving the file and closing Base, the file can not be opened again.Steps to reproduce:1. Open a database document file.2. Modify a table, create another table, etc.3. Save the Base file.4. Open the Base file.Current behavior:After working with a database document file with LO 3.6.0.4, saving the file corrupts it. When attempting to open the file, I get the Filter Selection dialog. This is true for LO 3.4.6, LO 3.5.6, and AOO 3.4.1.Expected behavior:The file should open Platform (if different from the browser): Browser: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:14.0) Gecko/20120715 SeaMonkey/2.11 CreatedA Copy made of Budget.odb before opening the original with LO 3.6.0.Dan,I can reproduce this on Linux 64bit 3.6.0.4, but it is/was also being discussed on the German user/discuss mailing list, and I don't know now whether they actually filed a bug report, so this might be a duplicate.Alex@Robert : did you or anyone else from the German list file a bug report in the end for this problem ?AlexHi Lionel,From what I understand, this bug only affects x64 bit version, but for some reason when an existing ODB file is opened in Base, it gets truncated on saving, and thereby becomes unopenable in any version of LO, AOOo or equivalent products.AlexPlease check whether this is or not a duplicate of. For example, check with a recent daily or 3.6.1.rc(In reply to)Thanks Lionel, that's the one, but of course, I forgot to look for resolved bugs in my hunt for the dup.Setting as duplicate.Alex*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***

Commit.What I wonder is why 5eb16c1cf277a8a3514e81e64b211a2e4f4c7a8f pushed the value of RID_DB_TABLE_WIZARD_START so "tight" to 2525 and not to 2600, to give RID_DB_REPORT space to grow in future...(In reply to)Thank you for the feedback.I'll be able to commit and push only tonight (after my day time work). So if you want to think more about the value that RID_DB_TABLE_WIZARD_START should have (2600 or other) and post another comment here, don't hesitate to :-)BTW, I know how to push/"submit-for-rewiew" with gerrit and here I thought about pushing directly but I don't know the gerrit process for asking cherry pick on other branches. (found nothing on these pages:--- wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/GitReviewSo by default I'll post on dev mailing list.(In reply to)Let's leave author & committer a chance to comment on that, maybe we are overlooking something.You do the cherry-pick yourself (recommended: in a detached HEAD state or a special-purpose branch just for *that* cherry-pick: e.g. branch "fdo54542"), and push the result to refs/for/BRANCH_NAME; ah no, that's "submit-for-review".To push a cherry-pick directly, just do the cherry-pick and push it, as if there were no gerrit (but push to the gerrit.libreoffice.org repository, not to git.freedesktop.org).But I don't understand why you ask here, as no other branch is affected, or did I miss that?Just to be clear: I haven't OKed the patch for any release branch (libreoffice-3-5, libreoffice-3-6, etc). In my mind it was intended only for master, since only master is affected.(In reply to)OKOups, you're right! :-)Of course, moreover with the previous comment.Sorry for the confusionThanks for the fix, Julien.

LO copies the bulleted test lines from slide 2 into the ODT, converting the Impress style "Outline 1" to "Default~LT~Gliederung 1", omitting the bullet numbering however. Probably already fixed?Could someone make the test with the latest 3.6 release? The 3.7 release is still farway for most users? In my 3.5.7 the bug is consistent, I just produced it again.I really would appreciate a test of version 3.6? The test on 3.7 was done with limitations, thus not necessarily fully reliable. This bug is reducing productivity tremendously because it also destroys the saved version. I save frequently while working: ctrl+s and make every day a new copy of the file. Because instead of ctrl+b I hit crtl+v (English keyboard layout) I lost only today at least 1/2 day of work I am sure this will happen to other people as well.I changed importance to highest and blocker.Sorry to hear about the dataloss.This seems to be fixed in 3.6.2 and 4.0 master (e22be4 built today)There are no more 3.5 builds so closing this.Please feel free to reopen if you still get the problem in 3.6 or 4.0.

id=58275	CreatedInstall error messageIn preparation for the Test Marathon, I downloaded the LO 4.0 beta via bittorrent and tried to install it via "custom" instead of "typical" installation. The modification I did was to change the install drive from "c:\" to "d:\".LO installation failed.Attaching images of error found. CreatedInstall error message 2I'm hunting down someone to test this out, can you install on your C:/ successfully?I tried a "typical" install, without changing any settings, on the c:\ drive and still got the same error message"Error 1304.Error writing to file cli_basetypes.dll. Verify that you have access to that directory."I will now try to download the file directly (not using utorrent, and then install).You need to install .NET Framework (Client) 4.0.We are aware of this problem. We need to either make this requirement more obvious, or make it not be a requirement. The useless error message is Microsoft's fault, though.Thanks for the information, perhaps the installer could check for the .Net 4.0 framework as a pre-requisite. I will install framework, and try installing again.dhirenjani: Please tell us what Windows version you are using, and whether you had any .NET Framework installed before.I have Windows Vista Home Premium with SP2A few months back, I had removed .Net 4.0 and retained only .Net 3.5 SP1With only .Net 3.5 SP1, LO 4.0 beta did not install and I ran into the error message.After downloading and installing .Net 4.0 client framework, I was able to install LO 4.0 beta1, using custom install method.You can close this bug.Wow - what a sucky bug in Microsoft's infrastructure. Is there no way we can defeat it (for this fairly minor piece of .Net integration code that almost no-one uses ?).I wonder, could we detect the wrong SDK and simply turn off that .Net integration in the installer, or even default to turning it off in extremis for Beta2 ? ...Michael: Read the email thread, Andras has a good idea what to do, and it sounds as if it would do exactly what you say.dhirenjani: No, we don't want to close this bug as it *is* a bug that you can't install LO if you happen to have some, but not the latest, .NET installed...***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***I place a quote here from a mail from Andras Timar:" for testers there is an easy workaround.

JBFah looks like it may be fixed, thanks for the link, once it's verified as fixed (RC is coming out next week) we'll mark as RESOLVEDJBF: As far as I know, if you don't have any .NET at all (as in a vanilla latest-SP XP), there is no problem in installing. The problem happens if you have *some* .NET but not 4.0. And I don't see what problem there is in requiring 4.0 then in that case, if the machine already has some .NET anyway. Doesn't Windows Update recommend installing .NET 4.0 anyway?Won't this fix fail when newer .NET will be released, i.e. 5.x will be installed and LibO will try to copy its 4.x version? Or do I not understand something?(In reply to)I am afraid my English is too bad to express correctly what I mean.;-)I understood the commit as: now .NET â¥ 4.0 is explicitly required. So now, it is not a bug if the installation fails until you installed all needed dependencies. No problem for me. I imagine that this change implies there is some message to the user which tell him to upgrade .NET before to complete the LO installation.Best regards. JBFRuslan, I don't understand what you mean with "copy its 4.x version"?LO does not "include" the .NET Framework. It just includes some (relatively unimportant and never used by most users) dlls that are managed (.NET) code. (To be used by extensions written in C#.)HelloI reproduce the bug (error 1304 cli_basetypes.dll)with Version 4.0.0.0.beta2 (Build ID: 4104d660979c57e1160b5135634f732918460a0)and Windows XP Pro Version 2002 SP3According to the windows control panel:-Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1-Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 French Language Pack-Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0(In reply to)I successfully tested the second workaround.Thank you for thatRegardsPierre-YvesPierre-Yves: and what happened then when you passed that property setting on the command line? No warnings or other messages, no windows telling you that you need .NET 4.0? Then that property works is even better than I thought. (Now that I think about it, Andras probably described it just like that, but I had forgotten.)(In reply to)This... (no warnings or other messages).And that is what I meant by "successfully tested".Sorry for my lack of precision...The software starts without warning or error ... I do not know if such a message can occur during use, but I doubt it.RegardsPierre-YvesSo we require .NET 4.0 from now on. If user does not have .NET 4.0, then installer will silently continue and will not install cli ure stuff.(In reply to)What are the consequences in terms of functionalities when cli ure stuff is not installed? If there is consequences, we could mention them in the release notes.Best regards. JBFAs Tor mentioned in, it is for extensions written in C#. I don't know about such extension at all. The risk is near 0. On the other hand we are looking forward to getting bug reports related to this part of code, so we know if anybody out there is using it.Hello(In reply to)Confirmed with Version 4.0.0.1 (Build ID: 527dba6f6e0cfbbc71bd6e7b88a52699bb48799)same config asWindows XP Pro Version 2002 SP3According to the windows control panel:-Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1-Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 French Language Pack-Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0Thank youPierre-YvesSee #59232. Still a problem on 4.0.0.4 (first official v4 release)(In reply to)make that 4.0.0.3 - keyboard (== me) error.Gordon:What are the symptoms of that ? do we truly fail to install unless .Net Framework 4.0(Client) is installed ? - if so that would be simply horrible.The correct behavior would be to silently disable the .Net pieces in this case. Is that what we are doing ? can you provide more data on the machine you tested this on and the outcome ?Yes. A complete failure to install.It just unwinds (and, if you had 3.6 there before, that is now gone and you are left with no LO at all).As I said - I has to install .Net 4.x (I did 4.5) to get an installation to complete.Andras - that sounds pretty hideous; how can we debug that / help out with it ? We got quite a significant jump in the proportion of Linux & Mac installs with the 4.0 release - it would be sad if people downloaded & then could not install en-masse.Gordon - can you reproduce this on a clean machine - and if so - what exact OS/Version etc. ?I'll test it tomorrow. I guess it happens on XP, because Windows 7 has .Net 4.0 by default. So I'll test the following scenarios:Clean Windows XP, no .Net, 3.6 -> 4.0 upgradeClean Windows XP, .Net 2.0, 3.6 -> 4.0 upgradeClean Windows XP, no .Net, 4.0 installClean Windows XP, .Net 2.0, 4.0 installAs noted in(which I did reference, even though I'd forgotten how to get an automatic link set-up) the problem occurred for me on a Win7, 64-bit system which only had .Net 2.0.This is a work-supplied laptop. So don't ask me why it only has .Net 2.0, but it does (or rather, it did).I've tried this on Windows XP virtual guest, and having removed LODev4 which was installed using workaround 2 from, I cleanly installed LO 4.0.0.3 without problems, i.e. not needing any workarounds. So, I've not been able to reproduce the problem with currently downloadable release.I could not reproduce. Neither on Windows XP 32-bit (with and without .Net 2.0), nor on Windows 7 64-bit (with built-in .Net 2.0).3.6.5.2 -> 4.0.0.3 upgrade worked, standalone 4.0 install worked. When .Net 2.0 was installed, then 3.6 installed .Net assemblies, as expected. During upgrade to 4.0 these were removed, as expected. 4.0 installer did not try to install them (DotNetCheck did not report a useable .Net version). I mark this RESOLVED FIXED again.So the fact that others are reporting it as a problem on Win7 64-bit (see) doesn't influence anyone.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***(In reply to)No, because the screenshot in there was made of 4.0.0.0beta2, before the fix.Ah...I didn't add a screenshot there as it didn't add any additional info.But I *did* update the version and platform to indicate the latest release which had shown the problem.It turns out I have another 64-bit Win7 desktop at work (not much used - only just occurred to me that it is there).I'll have another go on that one.And remember that this will be Windows Professional, not Windows Home (if it might make any difference).Just a reminder ,version field is the oldest version that shows the issue - it should NOT be updated to a newer release if a newer release shows the issue. We use comments to track what versions have been tested & when a bug is in NEW status it is known that it's still an issue so no need to change verisnThat was the theory. Except that one doesn't have any .Net on it at all.I can only assume the the first system has .Net2.0 on it as it was prepped to mirror my previous XP setup (which presumably had it).Looking at the .Net 2.0 download page indicates it might be a real problem to add, along with required updates.So I'll leave it as being the result of an oddly set-up system.Just an update on my failures with this in case anyone comes across this in the archive.Since having .net4.5 on my system broke other things (which use the latest .net, but can;t handle .net4.5) it was removed.I've just done an update to 4.0.2.2. This failed with the "Error 1304. Error writing to file cli_basetypes.dll" pop-up.However, this time round I was able to install using the Command Line method mentioned in.

id=63627	Problem description:When Quick Starter is executed, after some time (less than a minute) the Win Task Manager reports that the system program has 99% disk access, at speeds more than 3.0 MB/s.This slows down all apps, including LibreOffice (LO). For instance cut and paste between LO and Notepad might take minutes.Also, as Writer, Calc and other modules stop responding, I abort them often. Accessing Win explorer (explorer.exe) is taking very long, an dis unusable, until aborted.Steps to reproduce:1. Launch quickstart.exe2. After some time, task manager report excessive disk access.3. Abort quickstart.exe4. After some time, task manager reports low disk access. This step takes longer than step 2.Current behavior:Unacceptable. This is a brand new HP Pavilion G7 laptop with Win 8 Pro, 64 bit, 8GB RAM, secure boot, GPT and and UEFI. And I cannot use it for serious work. Too unreliable. I still create and maintain all my professional documents on my 7 year old Compal laptop with Win XP and LO 3.xExpected behavior:A stable document processing platform.I will be more than happy if I can help finding this strange bug. Operating System: Windows 8Version: 4.0.2.2 release Some extra info:This program creates the excessive disk I/Ontoskrnl.exe - NT Kernel & SystemThe result (Sysinternals Process Explorer) is a very long list of temporary page file usage, called:<Pagefile Backed><Pagefile Backed><Pagefile Backed>... (Goes on seemingly endlessly)Some more info. The Mozilla products Firefox and Thunderbird (TB) suffer from the same thing: Firefox a little, and only when flash-like software is fired through the container functionality. TB suffers more, but by far not as much as LibreOffice.The short term solution for Mozilla products is to clear all history. After that they behave themselves for some time.The problem appears to be fixed in v4.0.3.3 (current stable version).Test System: Windows 8 Home Premium 64-bit, HP Envy H8-1445, 12Gb RAM, GPT, UEFI, Secure Boot.Step #1 was tested twice from a cold start, first by launching quickstart.exe manually at the command prompt, and also by enabling it via the Libreoffice Options menu.Each instance was left running for over 15 minutes while opening/closing a few sample documents with no growing increase in Disk% (observed with the Task Manager). No warning messages were generated.The comments on ntoskernel.exe, Firefox, and Thunderbird are interesting but I cannot link them to the Libreoffice Quickstarter at this point.If you are still having the same excessive disk access with v4.03, please set bug Status back to UNCONFIRMED and let's proceed with more details. Thanks for reporting.Shortly after reporting this bug I switched to the PortableApps version of LibreOffice (v4.0.3.3 3.3). Now I can reasonably work with LibreOffice. I can confirm that in this version QuickStart behaves normal.However, also in this version you cannot leave an edited file open, p.e. in Writer, hibernate, and continue editing. LibreOffcie will crash, and start a recovery, even if the document was completely saved, and there is nothing to recover.Should I report this as a new bug?Kind regards, and thanks for helping out,Hans LodderPS: Since then I also became aware that explorer.exe is not to be trusted: it hangs often if opened more than a couple minutes. This might be related, as also my issues with other 32-bits applications (FF, TB, etc).I checked all Windows logging files, and currently Windows reports no issues, errors or otherwise. I checked with several malware detection applications, and they reported nothing. I updated all my HP drivers, and checked with SlimDrivers if there are any other outdated drivers. There are none.I just noticed that selecting and copying information to the clipboard in Notepad++ does not become visible and available in LibreOffice Writer.Follow these steps to be able to paste information from the clipboard:1. Save document2. close document3. Close QuickStarter4. Restart QuickStarter5. Open document in Writer6. Paste informationFortunately I do not have to repeat these actions often...(In reply to)Great! Here I'll change this bug Status back to Resolved/Works. Thanks for reporting back, and sorry it took a couple of days (I forgot to add me to cc:).Yes, detailed reports are always welcome. Thanks :-)explorer.exe is not to be trusted :). I'm sorry I can't comment more on your Windows driver issues. I have a newish HP 8-core with Windows8, as well as my older HP/Win7 systems. Definitely feel your pain. BUT, if it's a Libreoffice-related report I'll help recreate the problem and test the fixes as they arrive.That's fun \o/!Thanks again for contributing,Liz(In reply to)This is a different bug.I'm not clear to recreate the problem in the steps you listed. If you have time, can you be more specific in what you expect Libreoffice to do here? In your shiny new report :-)Thank you,Liz
id=63652	As a pastor I publish weekly church bulletins and monthly newsletters the design of which depends on several tab stops. Problem/Frustration... I create a document, save it, close it and when I open it again, the tabs have migrated. Sometimes to the left, sometimes to the right, sometimes off into the margins, sometimes... you get the picture. That means that either I or my staff then must re-format the document and print masters for photocopying without closing and re-opening the document. Exchanging files between libreoffice on my mac with libreoffice on the church's pc only compounds the problem. AAAaaarrrrgggHHHHHHHHH!Is this a common/known problem? Is there a fix I can do? Is there a fix in the works?Rev. Jeremy McLeod Which format are you saving in? .odt, .doc or .docx?Which version of LibreOffice are you using? (Help > About)And a sample file - that would be great.The problem most likely is that you have different fonts on the different systems. Each font has different metrics, so the text has different size and it matches different default tab positions.It might help if you define exact tab positions in "Format/Paragraph/Tabs". Another solution would be to use Tables or Frames.The best solution depends on what you want to achieve. In each case, you should not do formatting using spaces or normal tabs. This is not portable and it always causes these problems.The proper solution is to do the formatting the right way. I am sure that the above hints will help. If not, I would suggest to ask on thewhere you could get more precise hints how to achieve the wanted formatting.I close this bug for now. Feel free to reopen it, it the above hints do not help or if nobody suggest a working solution at.

I mean, if you happen to have the dir it works.Caolan McNamara committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":Resolves: fdo#65501 ensure configured backup dir exists before using itThe patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

id=65951	Problem description:After installing Java 7 Update 25, any attempt to open a report in Base causes LibreOffice to crash.Steps to reproduce:1. Open any previously written report in a Base document. Operating System: Mac OS XVersion: 4.0.4.2 rcLast worked in: 4.0.3.3 release Same problem exists for the release version 4.0.4 and 4.1.0.0.beta2 both with Java 7 Update 21.The bug seems not to be platform dependent as this behavior is the same in Windows 7 and Ubuntu 13.04.Version 4.0.3.3 works on both operating systems without any problem.Confirmed that the problem is not restricted to only LibreOffice 4.0.4.2 and Java 7 Update 25. The same problem is occurring on my other Mac, which has the following profile:Operating System: Mac OS X 10.6.8Version: 4.0.4.2 (release)Java Runtime Environment: 1.6.0_51-b11-456-10M4508I don't have any database files, but since according to, problem is reproducible, therefore setting status to "NEW".Back-revving LibreOffice to 4.0.3.3 on my machine with Mac OS 10.8.4 and Java 7 Update 25 does not cause LibreOffice to crash upon opening a report. This seems to imply that Java 7 is not the culprit, but rather is a bug that has been introduced in the LO 4.0.4. The title of this bug report has been changed accordingly.It is definitely tied to the report-builder. When I remove the report-builder the system reverts to the old inbuilt report builder. Obviously you cannot run reports built with the (Oracle) report-builder but setting up a report with the old inbuilt report builder works fine with no crashing issues.This should be a blocker.Also, I seem to recall that this has been reported for Linux 64bit too, but will have to find the dup report.AlexAdding Lionel, Julien to CCI don't get a crash on master build with OSX 10.8.4, however the app does hang.Testing the options in the Report section of an ODB file gives :- double-clicking on an existing report : error message that javaloader has no mapping from java to C++- Use Wizard to Create Form : nothing happens- Create Form in Design View : app hangs, requiring force killWhen killed, this is the trace I see :Process: soffice [15184]Path:

Put it at New + add "regression" keyword.This commitseems to have fixed the problem.At least, I don't reproduce it anymore!(In reply to)I reverted that, and (hopefully) fixed the original problem. Please test again withThanks.Lionel Elie Mamane committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#66002 correct error introduced by "AppendAscii cleanup"The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.Lionel: I git updated to retrieve your change then "make dev-install", it's still ok, no hang.Lionel: I was just waiting you putting this tracker at RESOLVED/FIXED to put it at VERIFIED :-)(In reply to)I was too quick/ambiguous in writing this comment. Apologies.DavidO's commit did fix this bug, by reverting a buggy part of a previous commit (a String->OUString conversion), which introduced this bug. I reverted the revert (that is, did the String->OUString conversion again), but additionally fixed the error in the conversion.I should have written something like:I did the work that this commit reverts again, but corrected the original error in the commit that this commit partially reverts. However, I'm not in a position to quickly test whether I really corrected the error, or if there is another undetected error lurking, so this needs testing again, because there is a non-zero chance that I just reintroduced this bug. I hope I did not.Confirming fix works on master 32bit Linux (Ubuntu 12.10), without any as yet untoward side effects ;-)Confirming fix on master OSX 10.8.4.
id=66239	How to reproduce :on Mac OSX, with master build from 26/06/2013 1) Open a Base file containing a report2) Click on the Reports icon3) Double-click on a report to open it for display4) Error message "Java loader error - no mapping from java to C++"What should happen : report should open and be displayed.Regression over LO 4.0.3.3Alex Adding Lionel, Julien to CC for info.Adding Stephan for the Java stuff@Stephan : any idea what is happening here ?AlexIn 4.0.3.3, on the same OSX system, the report opens just fine.AlexOn pc Debian x86-64 with master sources updated today, I don't reproduce this.Alex: just to be sure, could you attach the file? Perhaps it's specific to this one?Also, what's your Java version?Hi Julien,It is OSX specific I'm afraid. Using Apple supplied JVM, 1.6_29 I think. I don't have the problem on my master build on Linux either.AlexI've this with three different ODB files, all of them are taken fron bugzilla.Alex: perhaps it'll be useless but could you try to launch LO from console to see if there are some logs?BTW, do you build from sources or do you still have some problems about building?The interest would be to enable debug mode sincedon't show any content for: ---Alex: forget my question about building, just read this:Using 4.1.0.1, Debian, 32 bit, if I try to open or edit an existing report, built using 3.5/3.6 Report Builder extension, Base just crashes. If I try to create a new report using the wizard it says 'No valid report template was found'.If I open a new one in design mode it appears to work (although I have not pursued this).I can't easily submit a sample since this application is on mysql. I am even unable now to run the report on 3.5/6 since the 4.1 report builder has supplanted the compatible extension and I can't download it any more from the extension library (why is that - isn't 3.6.n a valid version any more?). All in all I have had to give up entirely on LO reports on Base and create them another way (using the ancient DataVision). The Report Builder always rather flaky.Tim: this bugtracker is specific to MacOs so it could be better you comment on fdo#63817 (not fdo#63398 which is solved now)(In reply to)Hi Julien,I build from master source, and most of the time, the build completes just fine.Yes, but enabling symbols or dbgutil all currently fail for me on OSX.It used to work for a while, then stopped working about 3 months ago, and the number of exceptions to DEBUG=true that you have to put in for each of the modules is a real PITA, and kind of defeats the point of having a debug build.Alex*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***
id=66265	Before installing 4.1.0.1, I uninstalled the previous version (beta 2). However the control panel still shows two entries for this older version (one for the main program, the other for the help file). If I click on these entries, the uninstaller asks for the msi file. "The installation source for this product is not available. Verify that the source exists and that you can access it."Unfortunately I have deleted these files after I got the latest version. So I tried to install 4.1.0.1 in parallel (without uninstalling the previous version), but this installer detects that an older version is still installed, and again asks for the msi file of the previous version (4.0.3.3); and then aborts the installation.I checked the C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming path, but there are no folders named LODEV, LibreOffice, etc.I searched the registry but there are no values/keys with LibreOffice, LO, LODEV, etc.Since I have already uninstalled the previous version (4.0.3.3), the control panel entries must be ghost entries, but I am not able to delete these entries. (Usually the Control Panel offers to delete such ghost entries. But in this case it insists on having the msi file of 4.0.3.3.)How do I get rid of the issue?I am ready to download the older version msi files, but they are no longer available from the website.Please help! Update: I did find the older msi by Googling. I hope this is the correct path:Will update the status after downloading these files.But still, the problem is weird indeed! The uninstallation should not look for msi files at all.Update-2:I downloaded the old msi files, and then re-ran the uninstaller (from Control Panel). Both the help and the main program got uninstalled immediately.However, the moot point remains: Why does not manage within the installed base?Andras, how is this supposed to work please?So, how would it find out what to remove then? If all go well, you have that msi in your Windows\Installer (hidden) folder. I accept that Windows is not rock solid and sometimes the package database gets corrupted. But it is not a reproducible bug.You can also search for the product code in registry, it is {FB548EA9-B985-4217-9EB6-EFDCB2DBA088}.

The positioning of the Label is such that it overlaps with the Footer zone of the report. This is still a separate bug IMHO.AlexCreatedapple crash trace when trying to delete field/label from reportThis could well be a DUP of fdo#61380Alex, you tagged this as regression, but I don't see in any comment in which version it was working. Please specify that (if necessary, after testing with older/stable versions), or remove the regression keyword.All this works in LO 3.6.6.2, LO 4.0.3.3 and LO 4.1.0.2 under Linux 64bit rpm. You could delete both fields. Alex, you could be happy, when you could create a report in LO 4.2.0.0 beta - I can't. LO will hang when I want to start to create a report.And of course, I don't see the problem on my 32bit Linux build from master, sigh.Will report on or rectify OSX regression status later.AlexConfirming regression over 3.5.7 and 3.6.6 on OSXAlexFurther comments :In versions 3.5.7 and 3.6.6, the Backspace key, used to delete selected objects on OSX did not work (accelerator binding issues). However, Cmd-X did work and successfully deletes any selected object.If I try Cmd-X on the selected objects in my OSX master build, the crash is immediate, whereas if I use the the Backspace key, it takes a few microseconds more for the main app window to disappear.I am wondering whether the recent accelerator key work on OSX is the underlying issue here ?AlexOn LO 4.0.3.3, Cmd-X also works without crashing LO, whereas the Backspace key has no effect.Alex(In reply to)Hi Robert,On my 32bit Linux master build, I can create a Report in Design View but the windows are slow to appear, it takes my 4Gb RAM Ubuntu 13.04 system a good ten seconds for the Report Design window and Field Selector to appear, and certainly Unity seems to think that the app has hung for a while, as it darkens the screen. I put that down to it being a developer build on my machine, and not fully integrated with Unity, but maybe what you are seeing on your own system is that it is indeed slow to appear to the point where the app appears to have hung.If that is the case, and I say 'if', then that sounds like a separate performance bug.AlexHello all, I can reproduce this bug running LibreOffice Version: 4.2.0.0.alpha0+Build ID: 02fb63f8f29085213659b730456dbf0438c2f7ccTinderBox: MacOSX-X86_64@43, Branch:master, Time: 2013-08-01_00:42:37 on Mac osx 10.8.4.

Every time I do those steps results in a crash - clean profile = same crash.The only additional note is that you must first turn off the autofilters that are on - in other words, if you just open the file as is and sort by column X on sheet "UNFORMATED", no crash occurs. First turn off the auto filter1. Data -> Filters -> Autofilters2. Select the entire sheet3. Repeat step 1 to turn auto filters back on4. Sort by column XResults in nasty crash.Marking as UNCONFIRMED again - if no crash on Windows perhaps Linux only bug.

Thus, I amwitholding keyword "bibisected" until somebody finds my resultsadequately useful.For purposes of bibisecting, I treated two conditions as "bad":(*) segfault, as evident in version latest(*) signal 6, SIGABRT, with terminal messages terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range' what(): vector::_M_range_check but only after the progress bar started to move across the bottom of the screen. Among the LO versions which bibisect probed, this appeared in 3791268. The current attachment is from that crash.Moreover, as I went through the versions of LibreOffice, I sorted oncolumn B and took that one result--crash or no crash--as the answer.This despite my vague memory of one version of LibreOffice whichsucceeded in sorting on column A but crashed sorting on column B.This is my first experience using AutoFilter. I saw some surprisingbehaviour, even some which I think is outright wrong, but in the absenceof a crash I deemed the LO version "good".Let me continue with the standard report of bibisect results.

The dialog sometimes appears immediately and sometimes appears after a delay of a few seconds. I think that the delayed presentation of the dialog is associated with crashing versions of LibreOffice, but I was well into the bibisect process before I noticed the connection. Treat the observation as tentative.(*) In some versions of LibreOffice, that unnamed dialog captures <alt>-<tab> to move focus among its own controls instead of moving focus between applications.(*) After I told the dialog box arising from Data > Filter > AutoFilter to use first row as headings, the sort moved the headings down to row 148, after col B = 1 and before col B = blank. This seems just plain wrong. Joel?(*) 1 sorts before blank. Again, this seems just plain wrong. Joel?I can't reproduce this, on Linux.Does anyone test with a non-dbgutil build?Also, how are you sorting? There are 3 ways to sort by a column. I need to know which sorting method was used. Please be specific as to which menu item, which dialog, which buttons are clicked, which icon was pressed, and where the cell cursor is at the time of the sort.Thanks.The versions of LibreOffice in the daily bibisect are non-dbgutil.But perhaps, Kohei, you want a distributed version?The sort I used is "Sort Ascending" on column B. For completeness,the whole procedure with version "latest" (4118d73...source-hash-5bd6a51...) from the daily bibisect is ...(1) Run soffice from the command line, naming the example file attached to this bug. Program displays window "Unconfirmed.ods - LibreOffice Calc", sheet UNFORMATED, with cell I12 selected. The cells in row 1 each have a down-arrow button.(2) Take menu options Data > Filter. Note that AutoFilter is selected (the icon at the left of AutoFilter is against a dark background).(3) Click sub-sub-menu option AutoFilter. Program presents dialog box "Autofilter not possible". In row 1 of "Unconfirmed.ods...", the cells do not have down-arrow buttons.(4) Click <OK> in the dialog. Focus returns to "Uconfirmed.ods...".(5) Select the whole sheet by clicking on the rectangle above row numbers and to the left of column numbers. (Surely this rectangle has a name?) Program colours all visible cells to show selection.(6) Take menu option Data > Filter > AutoFilter. Program presents dialog "LibreOffice Calc: The range does not contain column headers. Do you want the first line to be used as column header?".(7) Click <Yes> in the dialog. Focus returns to "Unconfirmed.ods...", each visible cell in row 1 has a down-arrow button, all visible cells are shaded to show selection, and cell I12 is outlined.(8) Click the down-arrow button in cell B1. After about five seconds, the program presents pop-up with options "Sort Ascending", "Sort Descending", "Top 10", "Empty", "Not Empty", "Standard Filter...".(9) Click "Sort Ascending". Program produces segfault.Thanks Terrence. Did exactly that and ensured that your descriptions matched mine in each step. And it still doesn't crash...Perhaps this no longer happens in the latest master?I am starting git fetch now. Should have something to report within 24 hours.Createdbacktrace from later segfault, executing on a 64-bit systemWith master commit ecb842e, pulled around 2013-08-13 22:30 UTC, builtwith --enable-dbgutil, the results are different, but further actionslead anyway to a segmentation fault. So, picking up from step (9) of, my revised report is ...( 9) Click "Sort Ascending". Program resorts the rows so that all cells visible in column B have 1. Note that the header row has been sorted out-of-sight.(10) Type ctrl-Z. Row 1, in particular, is once again the header row with down-arrow buttons.(11) Click the down-arrow button in cell B1. Program present the pop-up.(12) Click "Sort Descending". Segfault.The backtrace again shows function __gnu_debug :: _Safe_iterator_base :: _M_attach_single ( __gnu_debug :: _Safe_sequence_base * , bool )So, I conclude that (a) this is, in some ill-defined sense, the same crash; and (b) a non-dbgutil build is unlikely to fail the same way.Still, if the non-dbgutil build is not somehow unclean--perhapsrelying on undocumented behaviour of the STL, or something--it wouldsuggest a problem in STL. Unless our code really is different with--enable-dbgutil; I saw a commit fixing one of those bugs in the lastfew days.Createdsimpler test documentHere is a simpler way to reach a segfault:(1) Download and open the attached file, simpler.ods. Or, in an empty worksheet, just enter in rows 1 to 3 and columns A to C ... number en fr 1 one un 2 two and turn on AutoFilter.(2) Sort on column A descending.(3) Sort on column B descending.Emptiness of cell C3 is essential to the segfault: type "deux" in thatcell and there is no crash.Thanks. At this point I'll assume that this crash only happens with a dbgutil build, which likely means some mis-use of singular iterator instances which normally don't crash in the release build, but that itself is an error.I'll take it.Well, I just built myself a dbgutil build, convinced that that would reproduce this crash. I followed Terrence's simpler example in, but still doesn't crash... :-(Well, this is disappointing. I also tried the original scenario with my dbgutil build, and still no crash... No idea what's going on here...I'll put to back to the default owner for now.Terrence: on pc Debian x86-64 with master sources updated today (+ brand new LO profile), I don't reproduce this.Could you tell precisely what you use to sort the columns?Here what I did:- select column A (by clicking "A")- click Sort descending icon => LO asked me if I wanted to 1) Extend selection 2) Current selection 3) CancelI clicked on "Extend selection" and it turned off the Autofilter.Then I kept on the same way with Column B and no crash.I also tried with ("Current selection"), Autofilter turned off again and no crashconfig elements:gcc (Debian 4.7.3-4)ldd (Debian EGLIBC 2.17-92)autogen.input includes --enable-debug and --enable-dbgutil(In reply to)Julien, follow Terrence's very detailed steps in. That's almost as good as we could ask for.Createdconsole + bt with symbols on master sourcesThank you Kohei, I've been able to reproduce the problem.I attached console logs (which showed a lot of errors) + bt but this last one seems exactly the same as Terrence's one.Julien,You do not say whether you started with the first attachment (a normalworkbook from Joel Madero) or the later one (my trivial worksheet).In the latter, the "Sort Descending" icon gives me a segfault, butonly after a "Sort Descending" on another column.However, I can make a segfault on the first sort after loading thesheet by entering row 4 with values 3,three,drei before sorting oncolumn C.Kohei,Is it the case that an empty cell should work well in a swap-cellsoperation?(In reply to)Sorry Terrence, it was with the Joel Madero's one.I'll give a try with yours and keep you informed of course:-)(In reply to)Of course. We even have a unit test case for that with empty cells.How many of you have live spell check enabled when the crash happens? Does turning that off make any difference?(In reply to)I reproduced the problem with your file but only with second method (row 4).With first method, I chose "Sort Descending" for 1 column, LO proposed me Extend/Current/Cancel, I chose Extend, then another column, did again "Sort Descending", no crash.(In reply to)Kohei: I had spell check enabled (it seems the default option since I used a brand new LO profile).Anyway, I disabled it and gave a new try with Terrence's file method 2 (row 4) and no crash!Then I also gave a new try toand initial file, no crash too when live spellchecking disabled!I found Tools > Options > Languages > "Writing Aids" > "Check spellingas you type" selected. When I deselect it, the segfault goes away;when I select it the segfault returns.For me to make the crash, "another column" must be column C, and (Ithink) the sort must move the empty cell.(In reply to)Thank you Terrence, I reproduced the crash with first method. If live spellcheck (as you said Tools > Options > Languages > "Writing Aids" > "Check spellingas you type") is disabled, no crash.Ok. That narrows it down for me. Having live spell check on (which btw is also referred to as "online spell check") is known to cause hard-to-reproduce problems because it kicks in at random and modifies cell content.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Kohei: I found that fdo#67141 had the same bt and disabling "checking spelling" prevents LO from crashing.The description of the buggives a even more straighforward process to reproduce the bug (at least for me :-))FWIW, I can not reproduce on Version: 4.2.0.0.alpha0+Build ID: 22d1beb78a475e4846af945afde1c4d6c263b5d6on OSX 10.8.4.My master build is a 64bit OSX version from 22/08/2013.AlexI tested with simpler.ods, and it made no difference whether I turned live spellchecking on/off.AlexI've made a whole bunch of changes on the master branch just now, to rework the way how calc's online spell check works. The new implementation doesn't modify the document content, so it should make this use case a lot more stable.@KoheiThank you for the fix.I have built on ubuntu 32-bit and tested on ubuntu 32-bit and 64-bitwith no observed problem.@JoelIs it a bug that the sort should move the heading row to the bottom inthe example file that you attached. That does not happen with mytrivial worksheet.Terry.Yeah it is - but I believe it's been reported on another bug. No clue the # unfortunatelyI'll park this bug on me since I fixed it.Thanks Kohei - glad it got fixed before release.
id=67235	Problem description: When you create a main form with a subform with a time text box in the subform, the "time max" setting always reverts to 00:00:01 when you save the form, so you cannot read or change any times. I have not tested this in Windows since I can't take a chance on losing this function.Steps to reproduce:1. Create new database2. Create 2 tables including 1 field in each to connect main form with subform, and including a time text box in the subform3. Use wizard to create main form and subform including the time text boxCurrent behavior:You will be unable to see or change any times in the time text box. "Time max" setting for the text box remains at 00:00:01 when you try to change it and save the form. This happened in both data sheet view and with text boxes.Expected behavior:Times will show correctly in the time text box in the subform, you will be able to change times in the text box, and changes to the "time max" setting will be saved Operating System: DebianVersion: 4.1.0.1 rc Would be better if you could attach a little database. I don't know what you mean with "time text box".CreatedThe information fields in both tables help explain the problem I'm having.Open the form and try to change the time. Then try to adjust the control settings to make the time box & column (both main & subform in this case) work.I don't know where the bug started, but I had to pick a version. I know it didn't happen in 4.0.3. I never tested it in any version other than Debian. I use Ubuntu 12.04 for my OS, with latest updates. I had to quit using 4.0 because reports stopped working in 4.0.4CreatedTimefield in a tablecontrol is limited to 1 secondI can confirm this bug. It isn't a problem of the subform. So I created a new form and a tablecontrol with a timefield. All timefields in a tablecontrol are automatically limited to 00:00:01. You could see this, when you try to change the value of one row and then have a look to the table, 00:00:01 appears.The timefield in a tablecontrol works right LO 4.0.4.2.One hint:If you would chose a formatted field it should work for you - but didn't solve the bug.I have switched the version to 4.1.0.0.beta1 - the first version I could test where the bug appears.If you're saying the problem only occurs in the datasheet view, please check the "TimeWorksCorrectly" text box in the "MainFormWithSubForm" form in the file I uploaded. The text box with a time field does the same thing as it does in the datasheet view in the subform. I discovered this after making the test database to upload.CreatedTime field not displaying existing (nonzero) table values anymoreSame bug still present in the 4.1.0.4 release.This is a blocker for us, as we are unable to read/change/assign course beginning times.(In reply to)Please see:Please do not change the version to the latest version the bug appears. Everybody, who could fix bugs, would search: What has been changed that this bug appears.The first version the bug appears I have tested is 4.0.0.0.beta1Hello,I may have another manifestation of the same bug. The LO version is 4.1.0.4 running on Ubuntu 12.04.We have a database, HSQLDB 2.3, which is used to store employee work time. We use Base as the front end. We use a split configuration db which is stored in a shared Dropbox folder.Two computers access the DropBox files, one is running Windows 8/LO 4.0.3.3 and the other is running Ubuntu 12.04/LO 4.1.04.All the tables, etc have been developed on the Windows machine.One table has 3 timestamp fields, two are set to default to current_timestamp when the record is created and the 3rd field is set to current_timestamp after a triggering event occurs.When you open the table in the Ubuntu LO the displayed dates are correct, however all times are set to 12:00 am. Although the display is incorrect, the correct system time is being recorded in the database. This is verified when the table is opened in the Windows LO, where all the records are correctly displayed.All formats in the table, forms and reports are set correctly.As a test I copied data from the table as displayed on the Ubuntu machine and pasted it into a Calc spreadsheet. The times were incorrectly displayed.I repeated the test on the Windows machine (accessing the same database), pasted the records into a spreadsheet, saved the spreadsheet and opened it on the Ubuntu machine. This time the time display was correct.I have also created a new table with a field default set to current_timestamp using the Ubuntu LO. This new table records the correct time in the db, but displays the incorrect time. I tried a query using datediff and the hours were calculated correctly, so the problem seems limited to the display.If this is posted in the wrong place, please let me know so I can repost correctly.Cheers,KatrinaCreatedTimefield in a tablecontrol is limited to 1 second, in a normal control to 0 secondThe bug doesn't appear only in a tablecontrol. It could be also found in a normal timefield.All values of a timefield in a tablecontrol were shown as "00:00" when chosen hours:minutes.Values in a normal timefield don't show any value when you open the form.Createdcom.sun.star.util.Time has been changed in LO 4.1.0 - could this give a hint?Tests with Windows give the same result. Timefield is broken in LO 4.1.0.4. Attachment is one hint from the german libreoffice-forum:CreatedTimefield and time in a formatted field for a timestamp are brokenHave readAnd the had a look at the timestamp. Its the same behavior in a formatted field with a timestamp - Time is shown as 00:00Hello Lionel,The input of time through a form is broken. Could you please have a look? or do you know someone else, who is working on form-controls in Base?Many thanks for all what you are doing for Base.RegardsRobertI will open a new bug. The time in the formatted field is broken in 4.1, not in 4.0are obsolete for this bug-report.Seems to be I am a little bit confused by testing all this versions. With LO 4.0.4.2 all the fields work right - seeThe timefield is first broken in LO 4.1.0.0.beta1. Version inis wrong.The time in a formatted field (timestamp) is first broken in LO 4.1.0.2.

Cabinet file "libreoffice1.cab" is corrupted.I've download the installation file twice, and ran it several times.System: Windows XP SP3 Professional, Hebrew localized. Hi,Could you please try to download from another mirror? Here is a list of mirrors:Also please right-click on the file in Explorer, choose 'Properties', open 'Digital Signatures' tab, and click on 'Details'. You should get a new window with the text 'This digital signature is OK.'. If it's not the case, or you don't have the 'Digital Signatures' tab at all, then your installation file is corrupted.Hi Maxim,I've download from another mirror (IL), and it works fine. Anyway, the digital signature of the previous installation file is indeed OK.Thanks for your assistance.
id=70210	CreatedSample document to demonstrate the issueWhen saving/loadinig a presentation/drawing with connectors, all the connectors skews are lost. Older documents with connectors formatted with line skew are corrupted by losing the connector formatting in load/save/load cycle.To demo the issue:1) Load the attached document test.odp2) Right click on the lower connector and open the connector properties. See that all the line skews are at 0.3) Change the line skews, so that for line 1 it is 1cm and for line 3 it is -0.60 cm4) Save the document5) Reload the document and visually see that the connector line skews have changed6) Right click on the lower connector and open the connector properties. See that all the line skews have been reset at 0.To me, this is a major issue:1) Means that draw/impress cannot be used anymore to draw block diagrams and flow charts properly2) Means that libreoffice now corrupts drawings/presentations in load/save/load cycle3) Means that all older docs when opened with newer libreoffice and resaved get corrupted and lose connector formattingI'm rather sure that openoffice in the past used to manage connector skews properly. Probably also past versions of libreoffice did it right, so this is definitely a regression. However I would not be able to say which versions of openoffice/libreoffice were correct.In any case, this is a regression shared also by openoffice 4.0. Maybe it was 'imported' together with changes introduced with openoffice 4.The bug is seen in Linux on an X86-64 Kubuntu raring machine, with libreoffice packages downloaded from the libreoffice site. But probably the bug applies to all hardware platforms and OSs. Update.Bug is confirmed and actually fixed for Openoffice. Fix is in Openoffice 4.0.1.By simultaneously using libreoffice and openoffice 4.0.1, one can conclude that libreoffice /saves/ the skews correctly, but ignores them (or resets them) on loading the files.Please, port the Openoffice fix asap! I realized about this issue late and already I have many many presentations to check for corruption.One more note about why this bug is quite serious.Say that you have >100 presentations and that you have drawings in them where you use connectors (e.g. electronic schematics, where connectors are a handy way to do wires since they let things stay connected when positions of component are slightly rearranged, or diagrams or flowcharts).Say that for some reason you need to change an affiliation in the first slide.So, you open the documents one by one, you go to the first slide, you fix the affiliation, you save. Since you are just fixing something in the first slide, you do not even look at the other ones.One month later you realize that many of your diagrams in all your >100 presentations are now broken.A side note. LibO should probably have automatic testing in place for this kind of LOAD/SAVE consistency issues. It can probably suffice to have some test docs for which doc is just opened and re-saved without any editing and then the saved doc is compared to the original test document for differences.The same bug is tracked in OpenOffice (and has been fixed there) atHi.. It's possibly duplicate to one of these bugs:Fixed bug title.One can easily verify, by comparing with Apache Openoffice, that the bug is just in the file open path.From the number of duplicates it seems like this is a problematic issue to many.Note that in Apache this was considered a release blocker.Fix inplease port for 4.1.3.See also***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***I have changed the platform to all as this affects both Linux and Windows, updated the importance to high as this 'damages' existing documents for other users.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Apparently 4.1.3 RC2 is out with no fix for this issue.Is a 4.1.3 RC3 being considered?I wish that LO QA could consider this bug a release blocker as Apache Openoffice QA did.Please, consider once more that the current behavior means that you open a document and when you save it again (regardless whether it was modified or not), the document gets corrupted.With this issue, Libreoffice is not just misrendering draw/impress documents, it is actively destroying people's work and in a very subtle way (user changes title in first slide and the 100 following slides have their diagrams made useless when he saves). User may realize at the very important presentation of his life. This may mean throwing away users' manmonths work. I spent the last day fixing back some slides of mine using AOO.This bug is also a major problem for me as it has corrupted a number of business documents I have. I would urge someone to pick it up as soon as possible.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***If I didn't make mistake reproducing, it's not reproducible on LO 4.0.6.2 (Win7 32bit). Maybe regression occur in 4.1.xI can confirm, this does not seem to be an issue on 4.0.6.However, on that version there seems to be a bug where a connector with 2 skew lines initially doesn't show all handles after loading (and the one handle it does show is moving in the wrong direction). When I try to make a change to such a connector, the routing is reset and then works as expected after that. I also noticed that the connector dialog for such a connector has the line skew settings disabled.A connector with 1 skew line seems to have no problems at all on 4.0.6. I have not tested connectors with 3 skew lines.So it's not perfect on 4.0.6, but I would call it an annoyance.The fact that the release notes of 4.1.3 do not even mention the possibility of ruining existing documents may get judged as unfortunate by some users. Particularly, because 4.1 is now indicated as 'recommended'.Please, at least update the release notes.This is, arguably, one of the most pressing bugs in Draw (perhaps all of LibreOffice) as it, effectivly, shuts down Draw's ability to be used for anything but the most basic diagrams. This has been around for months (at least) and needs to be fixed.SeanI would like to underline again that it is even worse than that.I would not complain this loudly if for some versions of LibO there was no draw and impress at all or if it was simply unusable.The problem is that this defect makes LibO /appear/ useful, while it is in fact actively destroying a potentially large amount of previous document preparation work from the users. I am still through reconstructing my slides with LibO 4.0 and AOO 4.0.1. This is a huge issue, and the most damaging thing that could be done to the perception of LibO and free software. People biten by this issue may make the association 'It's free so it is risky. I must expect that it can deteriorate my data in unpredictable ways.'.Hence, again. Please, put a warning in the release notes for the 4.1 series until this is fixed.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Looks like it is fixed (backported from AOO)Can someone verify this, tested using a master-build?This fix is _NOT_ backported (yet) to 4.1 branch. I'm not sure it's possible to do. But please test first on master branch :).Kind regards,JorenI have changed the status to blocker as I feel that 4.1.4 should not be released without addressing this issue, owing to the fact it 'damages' existing documents for other users.

Now it requires more reviews on gerrit, for 4.1.4 rc2.Thanks for the clarification.Please, do all that is possible so that it actually gets in 4.1.4 RC2 since having LO silently ruin documents even in 4.1.4 would be really bad.Also, please try to assure that it gets some visibility in the release notes, since this time I really think that people who are on 4.1 *must* upgrade.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***The fix will be in LibreOffice 4.1.4.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Excellent news that the fix is in!

id=70664	CreatedPictures couldn't be saved in a table created by the GUITake the attachment. There is one table, created by the GUI. One filed of this table is a field with the type BLOB.I have created a form by the wizard. The wizard creates a field for input of a picture, but the BLOB of the table doesn't save the picture.The BLOB doesn't seem to be the BLOB SUB_TYPE 0 (or BLOB SUB_TYPE BINARY). So it isn't possible to create a table with the GUI, which could save pictures. Have now tested it with a Tools â SQL in the direct mode.create table MyPictures (id int not null primary key,title varchar(40),description varchar(200),picture blob sub_type binary);The table is created, but the filed picture doesn't save any picture.So it is impossible to save any picture in the internal Firebird database.Confirming on Linux 32 bit Ubuntu 13.04Version: 4.2.0.0.alpha0+Build ID: 6dd844917205a051c880ff7609c28e09698770c8As this is functionality which currently works in HSQLDB via the UI, I don't think we should be releasing Firebird integration if this doesn't work. AlexIn the GUI, the user isn't given a choice as to the type of BLOB subtype when in Table edit/creation mode.If a form is built based on a table containing id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEYpic BLOBwhich is all that the GUI provides for, then a form can be built on that and by default, double-clicking on the control that maps to the image field will open the file manager and allow a user to insert an image, with a preview. The image then gets displayed in the control on the form.However, saving the record, or moving to a new record and then back again, removes the image from the display, even though the data is referenced as an <OBJECT> in the underlying table.AlexAdd repro info to whiteboardAndrzej Hunt committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#70664 Implement Blob writing (firebird-sdbc).The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

id=71648	Problem description: Steps to reproduce:1. Start LibreOffice2. Choose Menu -> Options3. LibreOffice Base -> Connections or -> DatabasesCurrent behavior:LibreOffice crash with no message no error. I can reproduce problem on 2 PC's and 1 laptop all running OpenSuse 12.3Expected behavior:Open Databases option to register existing databases. Operating System: openSUSEVersion: 4.1.3.2 release Same system here: OpenSUSE 12.3 64bit rpm. No problems to register any database with LO 4.1.3.2 release, also with other LO-Versions.Where did you get 4.1.3.2 from?Have you tried to rename in your home-directory .config/libreoffice/4 ? It would be reinstalled when you restart LO ...Btw I run also 12.3 64bit on all my PC's. Sorry I forgot to specify it.Yes I tried to rename or delete ./config/libreoffice/4 and result is the same.I got 4.1.3.2 with update from OpenSuse yesterday evening from this repo I guess URL :It says 4.1.3.2 build id 410m0 Build 2 supplied by SUSE.I tried tonight on 2 other PC (in total I tried on 5). Result tonight is :first one running LO 4.0 build 305 build id 400m0 and result is the same crash. I upgraded it to 4.1.3.2 and result is the same it crash.second one running LO 4.1.3.2 build 2 build id 410m0 and it's working fine. What I noticed on this PC is that existing DB I use are already registered there. So when I go to Options -> Databases it works fine because list is not empty I guess but not sure.For all the others where it's failing and crash I guess the list of registered DB is empty. Of course I can't be sure of it as I can't see the list of registered DB there by default like Bibliography. But my guess is it's empty. Again not sure.Do you know if there is a way to register an entry in other way than with Options -> Databases in GUI ?I could delete the entire list and see if with an empty list it fail but sorry it's the onlyPC where it works fine and I need it so I can't do this test. May be you could try ?(In reply to)If you are using the SuSE-version the name of the folder is 4-suse. I have such a folder here in that path, but not the 4.1.3.2 from openSUSE, only 4.1.1.2. from another repo.I have deleted all entries in the register in my LO 4.1.3.2, directly from LO. I restarted 4.1.3.2 and could register new databases.Could you please report the same you reported here to? Seems to be it is a bug of the packages of OpenSUSE.Yes sorry folder is 4-suse but result is the same.On working PC I deleted all registered databases an like you was able to register new one. On all others it crash.I reported the bug where you told me :Thanks for your help.OlivierOlivier: would it be possible you try to retrieve a backtrace by following this link?Julien: it's pity because I had a core this week but I don't have it anymore as I update my PC at work to Opensuse 13.1 and now problem is gone. I still have other PC with Opensuse 12.3 and LO 4.1.3.2 so I will reproduce it when back home. When it crashed java generated a core.I will retrieve back trace for you at home ...I couldn't take a backtrace with the command advised in the link you gave me as LO was hanging staring with : soffice --backtrace. Reproducing my problem I got a core java dump but it's too be and can't be attached to this thread. How can I send it to you ?Olivier: there's perhaps you could try the old manner:- launch LO from a first terminal/console- open a new terminal/console and run this: - LOPID=$(pidof soffice.bin) - gdb soffice.bin $LOPID - type "c" (without quotes) then enterGo back to first terminal/console and reproduce the crash, at the very moment where you should have the crash, there'll be an hanging, at this moment go to second terminal/console and you should see a segfault or something, just type:bt (to retrieve a backtrace)If you got several "?", type c (for "Continue") until another it stops again then try again "bt".CreatedBacktrace LO 4.1.3.2Thanks for your help it worked.

id=71423	Createdhs_err_pid3856.logAfter one of the last LibreOffice Updates for Ubuntu 13.04, LibreOffice Impress behaves unstable. It crashes very frequently when editing tables in slides.

It actually costed me quite some nerves as I needed to get a presentation done for today and it crashed very often when editing tables.What did I do?* I disabled the extensions Zotero and Languagetool. No change, still crashes.* I disabled Java in the options. No change, still crashes.* I installed LibreOffice Version 4.0.6.2 (Build ID: 2e2573268451a50806fcd60ae2d9fe01dd0ce24) from the LibreOffice website. The crashes also occur in this version, but a bit less frequent (I think so).What other testing could I do? Unfortunately, I cannot attach the presentation here, but I could send it to someone's email address.Createdgdbtrace.logCreatedstrace.log.7zAdded a backtrace and a strace log.Hey Gerry,Thanks for the trace - have you made sure to try with a fresh profile? I'm requesting additional input here before moving to NEW but with all the info you provided, likely it will be marked as NEW and we'll hopefully get it fixed soon.(In reply to)Hi Gerry, can you install libreoffice-dbg to get debug symbols, which will make the stacktrace way more readable?Createdgdbtrace(with libreoffice-gdb).log@BjÃ¶rn: As you suggested, I installed libreoffice-gdb and continued testing. With libreoffice-gdb it took a bit longer (about 1 minute) until LO finally crashed. Please find the new gdbtrace.log attached.Createdgdbtrace(with libreoffice-gdb 2nd test).logPlease find attached the gdbtrace.log from a second test with libreoffice-gdb. This time LO crashed within a few seconds when I started editing a table in the presentation.Gerry: Can you please provide a test document so this can be tested against and subsequently be confirmed. If your document contains sensitive data, please clear that or replace it with random information.A step-by-step description of how to reproduce the issue is most helpful and will help to speed up the processing of this problem a lot.Setting to NEEDINFO until more detail is provided.After providing the requested info, please reset this bug to UNCONFIRMED. Thanks :)Thanks Foss for looking into the bug. I will try removing the sensitive information and hope that this doesn't change the tendency to crash. This time (in my test today), Impress hung long enough so that Apport-gtk of Ubuntu appeared. This is the information Apport collected from the crash:(36MB)I think the relevant information on the LibreOffice crash starts in line 1731.Besides the apport-gtk crash report in, I can also provide the presentation with removed sensitive stuff. You can download it here:(7.4MB)With this cut-down presentation, Impress also crashes.How to reproduce the crash:* Please start Impress* File -> Open -> choose attached file* There is no single event that crashes Impress, but it has always to do with tables in the presentation. Hence, to reproduce the crash you need to play a bit with tables. Do, for example:** on slide 54: Select with the mouse both heading cells of the table and choose Arial for both and font size 18. (sometimes it already crashes here). Then try to make the table smaller by selecting the middle blue rectangle in the bottom of the table and try to move the bottom edge of the table upwards (this usually makes tables smaller). (sometimes it crashes by doing this).* If it still does not crash, try to do something similar with slides 55, 58, 59, 62, 63,.... (highlighting more than one cell and change font and font size, change content, try to change the table size from the bottom upwards, and so forth).* On my system, there is a 100% chance that Impress crashes when I play a bit with tables in this presentation.I can confirm frequent crashes when using tables in Impress.This behaviour began in LO 4.1 branch and 4.0.5.I've never been able to have steps to reproduce the crashes but working with tables is now a problem. This afternoon again, with LO 4.1.4.1.The crashes came at the same time with this bug :(witch is a very annoying bug)I am experiencing the same (very annoying) bug on Windows 7 Home Premium 6.1.7601 SP1 Build 7601. I am trying to edit tables in Impress and it hangs every time. I am similarly trying to change font sizes, colors, and background colors. I have started from a fresh profile and the behavior is the same. I am using LibreOffice Version: 4.1.3.2Build ID: 70feb7d99726f064edab4605a8ab840c50ec57aBecause of the great backtrace as well as the confirmation from other users - I am moving this to NEW.Also putting it on MAB listA major problem (IMHO) is that, currently, there is no stable version of LO being stable for using table with impress.I can confirm comments #10 and #12 frequently crashes but very difficult to reproduce. Just have to play with tables, modifying background, copying, pasting, changing font size, colour, and so on...All LO 4.1.x and LO 4.0.6 crashes too (not LO 4.0.5 ) so all LO available for download are buggy actually three bugs seems to have appear at the same time and may be linked :that one and these :Unfortunately, this bug had not been fixed for yesterday's release 4.1.4.I can also confirm this bug with the most recent LO update for Ubuntu: Version: 4.1.3.2, Build ID: 410m0(Build:2)It is a severe bug! For a completely different presentation yesterday, I almost could not meet the deadline, because of crashes due to this bug. Working with tables in Impress is not possible at this stage!Please consider fixing this bug for 4.1.5. Thanks in advance!This is one of the worst Impress bugs for a long time. The crashes when working with tables in slides are unbearable.If you need any additional information, please request this information.@Gerry Isn't it too late for Christmas guess ?I hope that this bug will be fix soon. I hope... But I don't trust it'll beI've just tried with the latest 4.1.5.0+. It just took me 10 seconds to make it crash. Just a new presentation, insert a table as default, and starting to fill it randomly...But with 4.2.0 RC1, I've played 1 min with tables... and no crashI just did exactly as requested with 4.1.3.2 and was unable to reproduce on ubuntu 13.10. If it's fixed on 4.2 then it was likely "accidentally" fixed - a bibisect may be usefulYou'll have to use the 2013-11-25 package that is listed on that wiki.Oh, please try with a fresh profile before doing a bibisect - it might just be a wonky profileI did all my test with a fresh profiles.anyway LO must not crash whatever you profile isI did not told that the bug were fixed in LO 4.2 branch. As said before, it is difficult it reproduce the bug. maybe I was simply lucky this timeIf the bug has disappear accidental, it can be back bay the same way I will do new test soon on 4.2.0 RC1(This is an automated message.)Setting priority to highest as this is a 4.1 MAB. This is part of an effort to make the importance of MAB reflected in priority too.I was observing the described bug in version 4.2.0.4 of LO (Windows 7 64).Selecting the only table in the presentation was enough to crash Impress after a few seconds. On the other hand, not touching the table allowed working on the presentation without issues for as long as desired.I tried the suggested clean profile*, and I am here to report that I do not observe the bug anymore. I can select and modify the table of the above mentioned file without a glitch.I do not remember which version of LO was installed before I upgraded to 4.2.0.4.* - I.e.:Closed LORenamed C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\LibreOffice\4\userto C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\LibreOffice\4\user-oldRestarted LOWith LO 4.1.5.3 (Seven x64)1 Launch LibreOffice2 Create new presentation by file -> new -> presnetation3 insert table, keep default values4 click on the last cell5 press tab to insert a new line on the table==> CrashLo is unable to recover the fileI've done it three times => Same crashBUTIf you create the new presentation with the Impress icon (after launching LibreOffice) there is no crash !trying it three times and the coming back to first way to create new presentation three times and then 3 crashes.No crash with dev-masterHumm... after a reboot, this way to make LO crash does not work any moreBut, playing with tables still make LO crash very quicklyAs I've had to work with table in one of my presentations. I can confirm that with LO 4.1.6+ it crashes but also with LO 4.2.2.1.Working with tables is unbearable !And no one seems to get attention at it...I can only said to my student : DON'T USE ANY TABLE IN IMPRESS(as I told them quite before : don't use embedded font with LO)Hey Thorsten - Assuming you've seen this one on the MAB list but wanted to CC you in case you're interested in taking a look. Looks like there's a nice gdb trace - if you want a bibisect let me know and I'll get one done ASAP. Thanks!At least, there is a workaround.Just use AO 4.1 betaI don't want to be inpatient, but I am now somewhere between 50-100 crashes due to this bug with many different presentations on three different computers (Ubuntu with LO 4.1.x, Mint with LO 4.1.x, Windows7 with LO 4.2.x). Every crash of Impress stole me a couple of minutes of work, summing up to at least one work-day lost, not counting my lost nerves ;-) UuuhTo sum up:* Working with tables in LO Impress is a pain* All recent LO versions are affected: 4.0.6 , 4.1.x, 4.2.x * It is a regression (4.0.5 and earlier was okay!!-> seeand))* It is an all OS problem* Reproducing the bug exactly step-by-step is somewhat difficult, but working with tables in Impress is generally unstable and creating a presentation with a couple of tables almost surely leads to at least one crash.* choffardet assumes thatandis related ->I just can't understand why is this bug ignored !As it was just told. I use three computers, and the bug is present in all of these computers. It's a serious regression. most often, there is no data-loss, but sometimes,some of the work isn't recovered.Just yesterday : To write a simple word in a cell, LO crash for each letter.This bug should be a blocker for the last 4.1.6.But IMHO, it won't be solved. And not sure it'll be for 4.2 branchThe only hope is that's the bug get away as it comesTjis bug may be a duplicate of this one :EDITING: Impress crashes after adding / moving table@Joel Madero: IMHO choffardet is right that this definitively should be a blocker for 4.1.6, the last revision of the 4.1.x branch. If I understand the ReleasePlan right, then "conservative" users will use that version at least one more year. Joel, would you be so kind to put this in the next ESC call as a candidate for BLOCKER for release 4.1.6?With le latest 4.3.2opening a presentation. working on it 20 minutes.When on a slide with a table.Selecting a column -> align centre ==> crash (of course now I save it before touching a table)I guess no-one is working on this bug.After reopening the file. the table shows differently (all blue instead of alternate gray)When opening the files with AOo, the tables also show all blue instead of alternate grey.Maybe a way to trace the bug ?FWIW we don't actually have true blockers - we will almost never not release due to a bug. I agree this one is pretty nasty but it's not going to block releases - we've done what we can - it's set very high and put on the MAB list. I'll see if there's anything else we can do to help encourage a volunteer to tackle itPlayed a bit with the sample documents, couldn't make it crash. Could someone who sees this attach a screenshot just before the crashing? I'm particularly interested in the state of the Styles & Formatting floater.Backtrace hints at const SfxStyleFamilyItem *pItem = GetFamilyItem_Impl(); pStyleSheetPool->SetSearchMask(pItem->GetFamily(), SFXSTYLEBIT_ALL_VISIBLE);pItem being NULL or something. Band-aid fix is trivial, but would be good to know this is really the sticking point.This bug is quite curious.I've yet a sample doc :To make LO crash, I just have to select the word 'Domaine' and right-clic on 'default'.LO crash almost every timesIt crashes on my laptop and on my notebook (both with Seven x64)But it does not crash with LO 4.1.6+ (on both computers) and does not crash on Vmwares with LO 4.1.3.2 and XP or Seven x64But with any LO on these computers I can always make LO crash, just playing with tables (inserting columns, lines, copy, pasting, changing font, size, color) it just take less than 5 min. sometimes 5 seconds, and yes rarely, I can't make it crashCreatedScreenshot-at-freeze-before-crash.png(In reply to)Please find attached a screenshot at the time of the freeze (before LO crashed).(Remark: I don't know why the screenshot looks a bit weird. My LibreOffice Windows looks normal before crashing)CreatedAnother-screenshot-at-freeze.pngAnother screenshot at freeze (before crash). (Remark: This screenshot looks nicer :-)CreatedThird-screenshot-at-freeze-before-crashing-pngAttached the third (and last) screenshot of the freezes (before crashing). (Sometimes the crash came too fast so I was not able to create a screenshot. In such case for example, the styles&formatting was free floating).After Thorsten's hint, I realized that the crashes seem to only occur when the Styles&Formatting window is open. If it is not open at all, I could never reproduce a crash in my tests today.Hi Thorsten, were the attached screenshots helpful for identifying the problem behind the crashes? Do you need any other information? Thanks!(In reply to)>Yep, thank you - especially the confirmation that it hinges on the styles & formatting floater!Thorsten Behrens committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":Fix fdo#71423 - crash while editing Impress tables.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.choffardet, davidemf - committed a band-aid fix that _should_ fix this(can't really tell, since I don't see the crash). Can one of you picka new nightly build fromtomorrow, and try toverify if it's fixed indeed?Thanks a lot Thorsten!@choffardet: Do you have the possibility to test the nightly build as suggested by Thorsten in? I am travelling and could only try it out later next week.@davidemf: Same question to you, of course. Thanks.Yes I will try it. but server GUI install is still proposing the master from march the tenth. I'm waiting for the one of 04/11/2014. Maybe tomorrowanyone of the reporters able to quickly check? there are builds available now fromI've made some tests with this latest dev master. And I wasn't able to make LO crash when using tables.It doesn't mean the bug is over. Sometimes it tooks me five seconds. Sometime five minutes. Some times I can't. But next day it took me only one second...BUT in this version, there is no extensions. And LO impress had curious behaviour.- Selecting all the table show a partial frame on the table even if all the table is highlighted.- Changing font size of all the table changes only some cells- Adding a row by pressing tab on the last cell works sometimes but not every times.- All these seem very slowand more -the difficulty to select a text frame is still here (this bug went at the same time with crashing impress with tables)CreatedTable selection bug.pngHi Thorsten,I did a fresh LO 4.3 nightly install in a VirtualBox with WindowsXP SP3 and after some tests, I was not able to get a crash with Tables im Impress. I did a variety of test and there was no crash. That's excellent!However, as choffardet describes, tables in Impress now behave very strange. It is very difficult to "grab" the edges of the tables in order to be able to resize the table. Furthermore, sometimes the edges are not there where the edges of the table are (see the screenshot attached). I also encountered situations where I was not able to select more than the content of one single table cell with the mouse. Only after clicking outside the table and then again inside the table, I was able to select multiple cells. Very strange.Version: 4.3.0.0.alpha0+Build ID: 087a79db1272858f107656c5ca3c6efb45680986TinderBox: Win-x86@39, Branch:master, Time: 2014-04-16_01:43:37(In reply to)Cool, that's good news, thanks to both of you for testing!But I would assume that would be the same in a master build beforeThursday last week, right?

Reopening.This behavior does not occur with LO 4.1.4.2UNLESS the helppack is not installed in its default install directory.JFJBPS. Is the Help path hardcoded?OK, let me get this straight:This behavior does occur with LO 4.2.0.1 (on OS X)EVEN WHEN the helppack is installed in its default install directory.It seems a 4.2.0 stopper.lp, m.BTW, on OS X the lang pack includes both localized help and UI localization. In my case LO UI is localized into Slovenian, thus lang pack is properly installed - which means help is installed as well. But it opens wiki help in the browser (Slovenian one).On Ubuntu, I have 4.2.0 rc1 and both with a fresh and with an old user profile, it does open the local installed help.So maybe Mac OS related?Should I open a new bugreport?(In reply to)maybe - lets wait for some specific Mac - QA imput first, I think..(In reply to)MacBook Pro Adapter is broken ;-). Will put it on my to-do list.Confirming, clicking on Help in the menu even with the installed help and french lang-pack leads here :There does however seem to be something wrong with the langpack DMG. It contains the app file, but it also contains a 35Mb LibreOffice.app bundle, which I've never seen before.

Why was this bug reported for "x86-64 (AMD64)" and "Windows", when most people confirmed it with any other OS? I set it to "x86-64 (AMD64)" and "All". If you (or someone else) think, it is not adequate, feel free to change it back ... ;)(In reply to)For me it works as expected on Ubuntu Linux with version 4.2.1.0+ (built at home), will test with the RC2.You can check the history () of this bug report. The change for Windows was a mistake. Thank you for the correction.On Windows 7 sp1, 64-bit with RC2 with en-US help installedVersion: 4.2.0.2Build ID: cd65d6220c5694ee7012d7863bcde3455c9e3c30F1 and the LibreOffice Help (the "lifesaver") both correctly launching indexed to correct article in the integrated help.Also, the Help button on the start center lands on the project home page. Would prefer thepage, but seems to be correct otherwise.So, would say WFM on Windows.Hi, Stuart, the last part does not seem logical - if help system is installed, the Help button in Start Center should open local help, not some webpage. This goes against the usage of LO on computers not connected into internet. I guess I should open another bug report for that.But at least local Help works on Win7, as your report.Also, I am marking this bug as a blocker - this kind of erratic behaviour of "online" help in an office suite cannot be released as official build, so this bug must be squashed before 4.2.0 is released.Reporting now also from Win2012 Server with 4.2.0.2 - instead of installed help it opens wiki help (and it opens English, not Slovenian help, I don't know why).It also has another quirk, localized version has the credits dialog in English (on OS X this is in the localized version's language).Strange.Works as expected in version 4.2.0.2 under Linux (Ubuntu 13.10 64 bits).Best regards. JBFHello, what can be done about this bug before the 4.2.0 release?This is a stopper - on some systems (without clear logic when this does happen) wiki help opens instead of installed online help. This is a no-go for some government use etc. where internet access while using such tools is not welcome or allowed.Also it means installing help packs is of no effect.It is not like some command in UI is not translated and it can wait for 4.2.1 or later ...Confirming also on OSX with 4.2 rc2, that even with the alleged installation of the lang-pack, both F1 and clicking on the Help button in the StartCenter point the user to the web site.As I mention in comments,, and 26, the packaging of the OSX lang-pack is wrong..DS_StoreLibreOffice Language Pack.appLibreOffice.appREADMEs Quite why there is another LibreOffice.app in the lang-pack image is beyond me. Previously, this was all packaged into a compressed file which was in the LibreOffice Language Pack.app bundle, so something has gone wrong with the build packaging process.Alex@Norbert : any idea what's happening here ?AlexSomeone @Mac could pls try with this:@Florian8.7M for the FR langpack is way too smallAlexConfirming that the daily 4.2.1, which installs as LibreOfficeDev on OSX, doesn't install French help if the FR langpack is installed.Alex(This is an automated message.)Setting priority to highest as this is a 4.2 MAB. This is part of an effort to make the importance of MAB reflected in priority too.This is fixed for me on LO 4.1.4.2 release build on OSX Mavericks.Also fixed in my own master 4.3 build from yesterday afternoon.I am assuming that the fix has been pushed to 4.2 tree also.Setting to resolved fixed, if I'm wrong, please change it back as appropriate.
id=72267	CreatedDemo databasePrior to 4.2 Beta (e.g. in 4.1.3.2) the following SQL is valid: SELECT "id", "txt", "num" FROM "Table1" WHERE "num" IS NULLIn 4.2 Beta this results in: "Syntax error in SQL statement syntax is ambiguous"See the attached demonstration odb, which includes the definition of Table1 (id is the integer primary key, txt is mandatory text, num is an optional integer), and the above query is Query1.The same error occurs using an external database with much more complex queries (I came across it with a MariaDB 10 database connected using MySql(JDBC)). I produced this stand-alone example to make it easy to reproduce the problem.This is a non-trivial issue, since checking if a field is NULL is particularly useful in some situations (eg where it may be a foreign key). Reproducible.Win7x64Version: 4.2.0.0.beta1 Build ID: f4ca7b35f580827ad2c69ea6d29f7c9b48ebbac7Select "Run SQL command directly" icon, works fine for me.NEW for All systems.In any form where you need to filter, sort, or link from a subform, and so on, LO needs to inspect the SQL. So whilst it is true that running SQL directly avoids the problem, sadly it doesn't work for many of my forms.Hi tim, it was for information about the bug, as you can see the bug status was changed to NEW for All Operating Systems. Now depends on developers.Hi Mario,Sorry if I appeared ungrateful for your info. I too was just trying to make sure the developers had a complete picture of the problem.I am continually amazed by the speed and quality of response from the likes of yourself and the others involved in LibreOffice. It really encourages ordinary users such as myself to spend a bit of time trying to pin problems down and then reporting them :-)No problem Tim, thanks, I think all are looking in the same direction.Reproduce also with OpenSUSE 12.3 64bit rpm. Same query works right with LO 4.1.3.2, so a regression.@Lionel : any chance that this is an unwanted side effect to the changes in "IS NULL" parsing ?AlexLionel Elie Mamane committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#72267 boolean_test is subsumed by general case "foo IS [NOT] bar"The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.(In reply to)Yes and no. The changes to "IS NULL" parsing are far older than that, but what happened more recently is that the parser what switched to a mode where it is more powerful (it recognises more expressions), but more strict.Previously, in the case there was an ambiguity in the grammar, the parser would just make a more-or-less not semantically justified choice (that is, a choice that has nothing to do with the grammer / semantics, just linked to implementation details).Now, it throws an error saying "there is an ambiguity", and the ambiguity needs to be resolved in the grammar (either by making it non-ambiguous or by assigning priorities to the different cases so that exactly one case "wins").So, in short, if testers could throw their most varied SQL at the parser and stress-test it, it would be really nice. So that we "catch" regressions as these as early as possible.The "far older changes to parsing IS NULL" have introduced the ambiguity that this case triggers, but since before an ambiguity was not an error (but a subtle bug waiting to be discovered...), we get this "regression" now that the parser is strict about ambiguities.Lionel Elie Mamane committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-4-2":fdo#72267 boolean_test is subsumed by general case "foo IS [NOT] bar"It will be available in LibreOffice 4.2.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

id=72647	With ESC decision to keep the UAA <-> Java Accessibility API Java Accessibility Bridge while implementing the IAccessible2 native bridge as an experimental feature for 4.2.0.0 now requires more work.The JAB has can no longer be enabled on LODev 4.2.0 beta1+ builds forward.Believe results from IA2 a11y related commit for 4.2.0.0beta1+ between Nov 21 and Nov 25th that isn't quite correct:The result is though that currently for the 4.2.0 RC1 users dependent on Java Access Bridge will not be able to activate it, and would have to attempt to activate the IAccessible2 bridge as an "experimental feature".Setting a blocker status accordingly--knock it back to critical if we're content to let the RC1 out without JAB functioning. Nominating for mab4.2 obviously.Really sorry, I saw this back on Nov 26 ()lost track of it and did not follow up.I know a lot of folks worked hard to bring in the IAaccessible2 native bridge in working form for the 4.2 release--also a lot of moving parts; but at present this regression in the Java Access Bridge would be discouraging for our AT users.Not sure how best to fix it. Pulling JAB out completely as already done in master might be the most direct way, but in truth it could be just some simple issue affecting the JAB--but will need to dig back into it to clear the regression.OK, so for anyone following along.I'd been testing against TB-42 daily builds of LODev4.2.0.beta2+. Build logs show the --enable-ia2 flag.I went back and loaded the pre-release LODev4.2.0beta2 (5 Dec). And it will not come up with IAccessible2 with "Experimental Features" set, insisting that I enable a JRE. At which point it comes up with JAB provided AT (monitored with Java Ferret). Original issue ofWhat are the compile flag differences between Cloph's 4.2 release build system and Thorsten TB-42 for 4.2? Are they building with the same configuration flags regards the enable_ia2 and the "fall back" for Windows Java Access Bridge support?yep --enable-ia2 build doesn't register JAB UNO component; should be fixed now.please test the new builds (as i'm only building master on Windows myself).Michael Stahl committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-4-2":fdo#72647: register Java Access Bridge componentIt will be available in LibreOffice 4.2.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

Hooray! :)One potential down side, is that we are now always activating support for Assistive Technology if an AT tool (NVDA, Jaws) is in use.Probably correct, and will not be an issue for IA2 native bridge alone--as targeted for 4.3 release--but the JAB is a bit resource heavy, and when an AT tool is active it is now challenging to disable the JRE--requiring deletion of LODev profile, and needing to kill the soffic.exe process tree not a good UX.see the attached image of JRE required error.Some notes on state of things for 4.2:**UAA -- Java Accessibility API via JAB**Possibly masked by the current "activate when an AT is in use" implementation.At this point it is unclear if there is a continuing need for the established Windows methods allowing a user to activate the Java Access Bridge-- e.g. 1) using Tools --> Options Advanced, Java options use a JRE and select a system JRE for use, coupled with Tools --> Options Accessibility Miscellaneous check-box to "Support assistive technology tools". Followed by relaunch of LODev.2) a Windows registry HKCU key value Software\LibreOffice\Accessibility\AtToolSupport of "SupportAssistiveTechnology" set true will also activate JAB based AT. 3) Setting the SAL_ACCESSIBILITY_ENABLED=1 system environment variable activates the JAB support. So a full install using the "Support Assistive Technology Tools" that will set the SAL_ACCESSIBILITY_ENABLED environment variable ( see) will still be functional.They seem to work, but hard to tell. And they probably should go away for 4.3 if we drop JAB based AT support via the JRE.**UAA -- native IAccessible2 bridge**Checking "Enable experimental features" from Tools --> Options --> Advanced panel, and restart of LODev--WILL toggle off JAB support and activate IAccessible2 support for AT use. Although it does not clear the use Java Runtime.If the Java JAB had not been activated as above, i.e. AT not in use then selecting the "Enable experimental features" check-box will directly activate IAccessible2, when an AT is activated. Not the common use case as anyone needing AT will usually have it in use on launch. Maybe not the best UX, is there a simple fix short of yanking out the JAB based support? This late in the release cycle can the IAccessible2 native bridge be made the default, and retain use of the JAB as the option?Migrating Whiteboard tags to Keywords: (regression)[NinjaEdit]

id=73464	If the IA2 UAA bridge is active while any existing document or any new is being edited--Writer, Calc, Impress--pressing the ENTER key is immediately crashing the edit session and LibreOffice "stops workings" and enters a document recovery cycle on next launch. Issue noted on multiple installations different workstations, Windows 7 sp1, 64-bit en-US with LibreOffice 4.2.0.2 RC2. en-US Help pack also installed.Version: 4.2.0.2Build ID: cd65d6220c5694ee7012d7863bcde3455c9e3c30IA2 enabled by selection of Tools --> Options --> Advanced "Enable experimental features"Monitoring with AccProbe and JavaFerret32 to verify switch from JAB or IA2 support for AT is active following logoff/logon. Issue occurs with either NVDA (2013.2) or if setting Environment variable SAL_FORCE_IACCESSIBLE2 set to "1".This is unique to the 4.2.0.2 RC build. Recent TB builds of 4.2.0 branch are fine. Verified that a /A parallel install of the next TB 42 build following the tag, works without issue.Version: 4.2.1.0.0+Build ID: 8308f6e5f50bcdd5cd4e5511a8a3bd5c64c93e2bTinderBox: Win-x86@42, Branch:libreoffice-4-2, Time: 2014-01-08_09:46:01Removing the 4.2.0.2 en-US Help package made no improvement.Performing a /A administrative install of the 4.2.0.2 msi package also does not help, the <ENTER> key press continues to crash the edit session when IAccessible2 is active.Can also consistently cause LO 4.2.0.2 to crash while editing a document with some existing text by positioning with cursor to an empty line and then pressing <BACKSPACE> to rub out a Paragraph mark.With no AT active, and AccProbe not running to monitor AT (so IA2 AT support disabled), the same <BACKSPACE> removal of paragraph mark does not crash LO.Attempting to isolate for stacktrace the program action, but its being elusive and the Windows application error is useless.Hi Stuart,You should download Windows version 4.2.0.2 again. The build you tested is broken as Christian Lohmaier said on QA mailing list.Correct build ID is 601a398b803303d1a40a3299729531824fe0db56 ()Best regards.

Verified that no crash is triggered in the 4.2.1+ build.I'm running a build from the 4-2 branch and can't reproduce the problem at all - presumably I need to build -4-2-0 now ...@Michael,(In reply to)I have ONLY experienced the issue with the two LO Production releases built on Christian's release build system.Either of these build trees:The TB 42 builds have remained clear of the issue, and I have not heard from anyone who rolls their Windows builds own having the issue.I don't know, but couldn't it be one of these:1) the build with debug is enabled (no problem on TB 39 builds of master), or2) it is a MSVC 2010 based build, or3) something in the OLE32 and OLEAUT32 support for the release build config?This is pretty depressing - I built 4-2-0 here from "Don't crash on unstarted table" incrementally on top of 4-2 and I can't reproduce the problem at all.Works perfectly for me. NVDA is reading nicely, showing selections etc. etc.I'm using Visual Studio Professional 2012. I'll do a build from clean this time with the release configuration.Christian - can you confirm the configuration you're building with ? is it only --with-distro=LibreOfficeWin32 ?Of course - it could be related to on-line help or somesuch; a11y does touch some funny code-paths, and I never build with that ...Thanks ! =)So here is an interesting twist. The TB's have been down, but noticed Chrisitian's TB 47 build of master was posted. So downloaded it and the en-US help and did an /A administrative install.On Windows 7 sp1, 64-bit with NVDA 2013.2 running for ATVersion: 4.3.0.0.alpha0+Build ID: 04c3d13ed942e6fc9feb78535701d48e5034d9e2TinderBox: Win-x86@47-TDF, Branch:MASTER, Time: 2014-01-26_00:10:53Runs without issue with out AT active. But as soon as I activate AT and relaunch, I get a crash on activity to launch a module -- Writer in this caseAttach soffice.bin process to WinDbg, and get a series of first chance exceptions. Symbols are a residual from TB 39 or 4.2.0.3, but some hits.Seem to all be MSVCR100!_CxxThrowExceptionHave to navigate through a couple of dozen first chance exceptions before I can get the debugger to run on the writer session. Even then doesn't seem to be a specific action that will crash the writer session. Don't know if I'm cycling from WinDbg for long enough.Point is, that the issue is no longer confined to the 4.2.0.3 RC, but is also appearing on Christian's TB 47 system build.Stuart - great data point - thanks so much for that; I'll give up trying to reproduce with 4-2-0 - I did a release build locally with VS 2012 - and can't reproduce the problem despite having the lang-packs and all that good stuff =)I strongly suspect this is an MSVC 2010 bug - almost certainly related to Link Time Optimisation, which we should disable by default for now for 4-2-0 I think ...running a build right now with the --disable-lto switch(the @47 tinderbox uses the same setup as for the release builds - so no surprise it is also affected, the other windows tinderboxes however use newer compiler)Compiler conspiracy theories aside (perhaps they provoke some race or other) ;-) I have a good hard crash in UAccCom.dll here where: CMAccessible::get_attributes() is called on an object where m_isDestroy is true and m_xAccessible is cleared / empty.Just pushed a patch that adds a number of checks vs. that sort of thing ...Michael Meeks committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#73464 - guard against NULL / unset m_xAccessible.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.My thesis is that this BSTR allocation mess-up is something that the C run-times for 2010 and 2012 differ on - the latter being more tolerant of people doing stupid stuff with BSTRs (perhaps), and that's why we were getting the crash only with a 2010 build.Michael Meeks committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-4-2-0":fdo#73464 - get relation BSTR allocation right.It will be available already in LibreOffice 4.2.0.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

Thanks :)***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Caolan's commit message explains what happened here:given the explanation of MenuFloatingWindow::InitClipRegion() it should not be virtual then prior to 95711f5b9e7b6a982d1762d37d5a38e0f40b86f9 the menu ImplInitClipRegion had nothing to do with the outdev ImplInitClipRegion and so all the original ImplInitClipRegion calls here should now be routed to InitMenuClipRegion which was removed by "In fact InitMenuClipRegion() is unused" so restore that.In other words, Windows derives from OutputDevice and this had a virtual function IntiClipRegion. However, MenuFloatingWindow derives indirectly from Window, but it used the function InitClipRegion for an entirely different purpose. When it was made virtual, it caused this issue.Verified using windows 8.1 using Version: 4.3.0.0.alpha1+Build ID: 145f2e970f46a3a3e5456b122d71f17c3abe878fTinderBox: Win-x86@42, Branch:master, Time: 2014-04-26_23:32:36Kind regards,Joren
id=78133	I opened LibO 4.3 alpha and when i was going through the options dialog, if i click on the 'Colors' entry, LibO will crash. Thinking about it just now, i think this must also relate to the color drop down in. Createdconsole logs + bt with symbolsOn pc Debian x86-64 with master sources updated today, I can reproduce this crash.I put max priority because:- it's a core function- no workaround- crash- regressionPatch on master sources for review:hmm, that pDrDoc has a GetColorList method, maybe we should call that one on the pDrDoc branch and leave the "generic" color list on the other branchIt does not crash for me in Build ID: 46cfcd5a05aa1d13fecd73f5a25b64b8d8dd6781 on Linux (fresh user profile) - but that may be an older build.How the *piep* can Severity and Priority change themselves with me just giving a comment? (Due to FF crashing just before commenting??)I found it weird that you changed it and was going to change it back, but didnt want to step on any toes. :)CaolÃ¡n: I've changedaccordingly to what you said.

id=79105	OS â Windows XP 32&64 bit Edition.The new regression (to the 1st alpha; only in Windows):The dictionaries based on Light Proof (English, Hungarian and Russian) don't work. Attempt to start the Writer leads to the LibreOfficeDev crash. LibODev-4.3.0.0.beta1 works normally if dictionaries are removed.It seems to me incorrect assembly MSI package (build environment) caused this error. The bug had appeared two weeks ago. OK in LibreOffice-4.3.0.1 so RESOLVED
id=79269	I filed this bug a while ago, but at that time it suddenly became not reproducible on my PC, and the person who answered me could not reproduce it either.Now I got it again. I am 100% _sure_ that footers are _not_ saved.It stopped working again right after I updated LibreOffice from 4.2.x to 4.2.4.2. I do not remember exact version number of previous version. I could possibly find out version of previously installed LibreOffice from my previous bug report, but sadly I could not find it. Looks like my previous bug report got deleted.Footers are not saved in my document. I uncheck "same content for first page" in footer format dialog, then I add page number filed to the footer of second page, then I save document, then I close document, then I open document, then I see no footers at all. "same content for first page" option gets checked again.I already tried multiple times, it always happens. I can post my document if it helps.I now think that this issue is related to updating. I installed new version of LibreOffice using windows installer from official web site. I now remember that last time when saving footers didn't work for me before it also happened right after I updated LibreOffice. In fact that time I did not update LibreOffice but rather uninstalled OpenOffice and then installed LibreOffice, then saving footers stopped working, but later is started working again. But this time it does not work at all. I don't remember what exactly I did previous time to make it work. It seemed completely random. But this time I tried already like 8 times, and... well.... footers are _not_ saved :/Thanks for your attention. Confirmed on Linux Mint with 4.0.6, 4.2.4 and 4.3 beta 1. LibO 3.6 does have the footer option.Here are some simple steps.1. Open writer2. Make a page break so you have 2 pages3. Menu > Format > Page > Footer - uncheck 'same content on first page'4. In footer of first page type 'WhatsApp'5. In footer of second page insert page number6. Save file as odt7. Reopen file and 'same content on first page' has been rechecked resulting in 'WhatsApp' appearing on the second page.I tested saving the file as .doc and .docx and it opened correctly. Saving it as .rtf resulted in it opening with only a single page and 'WhatsApp' was gone and only the page number was retained. I tested the saved .odt in calligra and it had the page number on both pages.Your previous bug report is. :)I've set this to higest-blocker as data is being lost in the footnote.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Just confirmed that unchecking 'same content on first page' in the header is fine in 4.3 beta but not in 4.2.

id=82336	Attempting to execute a multi-table LEFT OUTER JOIN query to a mysql instance via the native mysql connector causes LO to crash immediately.If the Query mode button on the main database window is clicked first, and then the query itself double-clicked to start it (request for login, then execution of query), LO goes into beachball mode, procesor occupation goes up to 70% and stays there until the application is forcibly killed. The query never gets displayed.The same query runs from a terminal against a local mysql instance in 0.08s and returns 636 results.The query is as follows :SELECT * from ipgalore as t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN (priority as t2,owner_list as t3,inventor_list as t4) ON (t2.fmpro_id = t1.fmpro_id AND t3.fmpro_id = t1.fmpro_id AND t4.fmpro_id = t1.fmpro_id)The same query runs almost instantly with LO 4233.

id=83612	Createdsample master documentHi,For some reason figure numbers are no longer renumbered with respect to their order in the master document. In the sample files attached and also uploaded on Dropbox () you will see that in the master document, Figure 1 from Subdocument 2, instead of being renumbered as Figure 2 is still Figure 1 in the master document despite being preceded in the master document by Figure 1 from Subdocument 1.What could be causing this problem? Looks similar with@Darius, please inform with which LO version you created that sample?Well, I used OpenOffice to create that file. As this is an issue in both OpenOffice and LibreOffice I submitted this bug to both OpenOffice and LibreOffice. That's what forking does.Strange! Now that you asked about what version of LibreOffice I'm using I found out that version 4.3 exists. However, I thought that I have the latest version. If I go to Help->Check for update... I'm told that LibreOffice is up to date.Anyway, just installed LibreOffice 4.3.1.2 and this bug is still present.Update is for the same branch.Eg: if you've got 4.2.0, it'll indicate updates for 4.2.1, 4.2.2, etc. not for 4.3.0Set back version to 4.2.5.2 because it is intended to show the first (oldest) version in which the bug has been seen.Best regards. JBFI re-checked and I noticed that cross-references are actually renumbered correctly using LO 4.3. It's just takes a bit of time.No patch included, should not be Fixed, but WorksForMePlease Darius, Cor is right, let this to WFM since there's no specific patch spotted for this bugtracker.

(you didn't install other Java versions these days?)com.sun.star.sdbcx.comp.hsqldb.StorageFileAccess.isStreamElement(java.lang.String,java.lang.String) is a native method; if this issue is Mac-only, I guess it is related to the recent changes to the LibreOffice.app tree layout, and the .jar no longer finds the .jnilib.Stephan Bergmann committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#84284: Adapt jar Class-Path to new Mac OS X LibreOffice.app layoutThe patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

(like)Ken: To know if it could be a regression, was a former LO version work on your Mac? If yes which one?Also, you must know that sometimes a crash can be due to accessibility components so I'll quote Roman's (put in cc) questionnaire."1) Do you have any accesibility features enabled? Appleâs accessibilityfeatures like âVoiceOverâ or âEnable access for assistive devicesâ, which getenabled in âSystem Preferences > Universal Accessâ, are known to cause many crashes and freezes in LibreOffice. So please try to disable any accesibility features, then check if the problem is still reproducible.2) Do you have installed any window management/user interface utilities/apps/control panels/extensions for Mac OS X like * AquaSnap * BetterSnapTool * BetterTouchTool * Breeze * Cinch * Divvy * DoublePane * Flexiglass * HyperDock * iSnap * Moom * RightZoom * ShiftIt * SizeUp * SizeWell * Spectacle * Stay * TileWindows * WindowTidy * Flavours (from flavours.interacto.net)... or something similar?And/or do you use any mouse cursor/pointer utility, i.e. some little application or control panel etc. which animates or replaces etc. the mouse curser/pointer, like * LazyMouse?And/or do you use any special software which could be related to accessibility stuff, e.g. a screen reader, screen magnifier, speech recognition software,a text-to-speech (dictation) application, or similar?All these and many similar utilities rely heavily on Mac OS accessibility features and therefore can cause LibreOffice to crash or freeze. So please check if you have installed any utility of this kind and try to disable it(or to add LibreOffice to the list of excluded applications for the utility,if there is such a thing).So please check these possibilities, if any of them helps to make the crash go away, and report the results here."CreatedCrash report with 4.2.61: Do not have any actability installed or turned on2: I have not installed and windoz management apps3: no different mouse pointer, just the normal trackpad4: the only thing I have tuned on is the speech of notificationsI also have it crashing with 4.2.6Thank you for your feedback, I put it at NEW since there's a bt.Just for the test, could you disable speech of notifications?Created4.3.1 crashing with out any Text to Speach onI turned off the speech notifications and 4.2.6 did not crash, so I bumped up to 4.3.1 and the crashing returned, I have attached the new log droping back to 4.2.6 for now(In reply to)Hi Joel,The output is, as far as I can tell, identical.

This will create a database called ipdatabase containing one table, action_type and the sample data.After that create your ODB file, using the wizard to connect to the database via the connector extension :Start LOChoose New DatabaseDB creation wizard starts.Connect to existing database - choose mysql from the dropdown - NextChoose connect directly (third choice in list, if you also have odbc and jdbc connectors set up) - NextFill in your database name and host connection address and port if different from the default (127.0.0.1/3306) - NextEnter User name / password if necessary for your mysql connection - test connectionFinish, then save your ODB file.Open ODB file and follow previous instructionsTesting on LO 4.1 gives the same error as in. Probably linked to the changes made to timestamp definitions (inclusion of nanosecond handling) during 4.1 development ?The problem is indeed most probably the "all zeros" dates from MySQL, which are not valid values in SQL.Basing the report on a query that does not include the chg_date column works around the problem.With what version did it use to work?(In reply to Alex Thurgood from)This error comes from Java. Since displaying the table does not use Java, it does not encounter this particular problem. I guess that Java refuses to handle date "0000-00-00 00:00:00".So... The hiding of the real error behind "ReportExecutionException" is indeed from Noel's commitcommit 9341bf3dc38b2cc117ffbe12ff057511ed6e046dAuthor: Noel Grandin <>Date: Thu Oct 16 12:19:14 2014 +0200 java: when rethrowing, store the original exception Change-Id: I34ce000c48d2d79bfec854c8dd55d12f2bee29c7Noel, you cannot stick an arbitrary Java exception into a UNO exception, only a UNO exception... It will not pass the UNO barrier to C++. Please review your whole commit in this light.If you want to make that kind of throwing more useful, you can do something like: Writer result = new StringWriter(); PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(result); e.printStackTrace(printWriter); throw new com.sun.star.lang.WrappedTargetException(e.toString() + '\n' + result.toString(), this, null)So, I confirmed that this error comes when trying to convert a "all zeros" timestamp (that ultimately comes from MySQL) to a Java timestamp. Java does not accept "0000-00-00 00:00:00.000000000" as a valid timestamp.Seeing the history of the code, I doubt it ever worked.(In reply to Lionel Elie Mamane from)Since official LibreOffice builds don't include the native MySQL driver, I cannot easily check that.Anyway, what could we do about this? I only see silently replacing MySQL zero dates with NULL. That's what the ODBC driver does. But the JDBC driver does it only optionally (and not by default, see zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull).So.. <shrug> haven't decided what to do yet.Createdpatch to transform zero dates to NULLHere's a patch to implement replacing zero dates by NULL unconditionally. If someone wants to add all the code and UI to make it optional, then we can do it.Else, I'll just consider it as a MySQL bug / misfeature.(In reply to Lionel Elie Mamane from)You can also separate the case of catching a UNO exception, and in this case store the original exception, from the case of an arbitrary Java exception, and in this case do as above.(In reply to Lionel Elie Mamane from)That is a good question, unfortunately, the shift to all 64bit program stack, including the connector extension, means that I can no longer test.(In reply to Alex Thurgood from)All I know is that it did, but that it would have been with an earlier version of LO (3.x ?) 32bit, native connector 1.01 ?, plus 32bit Java and 32 bit mysql - too many variables !(In reply to Lionel Elie Mamane from)This got me wondering how other Java report builders deal with this problem.After all, they interface with a wide range of different dbs with varying timestamp definitions.

What was problematic about Noel's commit was that UNO exception css.lang.WrappedTargetException takes a UNO Any argument containing a UNO exception value, and /that/ must not be an arbitrary Java non-UNO exception (was erroneously 'e2', is now 'new com.sun.star.uno.Exception(...)').That commit needlessly removes passing in the 'cause' argument.

id=86578	I'm using 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04 with a parallel installation (with separate user profile, etc.) of LibreOffice Version: 4.4.0.0.alpha2+Build ID: d273a60bfdbf9bb7623bed38667ec0647753157c - TinderBox: Linux-rpm_deb-x86_64@46-TDF, Branch:master, Time: 2014-11-20_03:05:21 - Locale: en_USI know this is similar to, but it is quite real and reproducible on my machine, and does not occur with my day-to-day 4.3 installation.While attempting to test the improved pdf export in 4.4 (BIG Improvement in pdf file sizes by the way), I thought that perhaps the smaller size resulted from the fact that Writer just left out quite a few of my graphics, which didn't appear in the resulting pdf.A little further exploration, however, showed that they were not visible in the document either, although seemed to in fact still be there - just hidden under totally (and newly) opaque non-transparent frames. Thinking that maybe this was a result of some sloppy formatting on my part, I changed a few of the frames to 100% transparency - permitting the graphic, which was already marked as "on top" to be displayed in Writer and then saved the file (yes - under a new name).I generated a new pdf and - viola - the graphics whose frames I had "fixed" showed up in the pdf.HOWEVER, when reloading the document, all of the frames were again totally opaque. To cut this short, I checked and changed the style for frame contents to 100% transparency as well, but that did made no difference in the results. The bottom line is that I can't use Writer 4.4 if there are graphics in frames.Graphics that I had placed in borderless tables, by the way, show up fine and export to pdf properly, etc.All Frames that I checked in the document (several hundred pages, so I didn't hit every one) show up in the dialog box as 50% transparency, although graphics placed in the frame (although not text, which was still visible) were completely invisible - suggesting that the transparency is really 0%.So ... The fact that Writer doesn't save the transparency of the frame would seem to be a bug. I suspect the change of the earlier default of 100% transparency (actually I don't recall ever setting frame transparencies before) may be unintentional as well if this is a new enhancement.QA folks or developers are welcome to contact me via e-mail if there are any other questions I can answer or things they would like me to try - I really want the improved pdf export, but can't use 4.4 as is (yes - I know it's an alpha, but I'm old and impatient :)FrankADDITIONAL COMMENT:While writing this, I happened to notice that the graphics that disappeared possibly had something in common: each of them was set to "in background" in a frame that was formatted with two columns. I'm not sure if this is a "clue" or not but thought I should mention it. @Frank,Not clear, are your working in ODF .odt or in filtered .doc format?How a bout a sample test document and your concise steps to reproduce.This is likely related to handling of background fill--and the exportand friends--but is not the same issue.Createdodt Document to illustrateHere you are - with my best wishes and encouragement.You can fix this - even the Bears won a game last weekend, so anything is possible!!Let me know if you need anything else.FrankPretty sure this will end up being a duplicate of fdo#80294, seeand c9.@Miklos, does this make sense?*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***Going to reopen and set back to NEWThis issue starts with 4.4.0 builds, which retain Armin Le Grand's writer frames refactoringwas reverted for the 4.3 builds. So, splitting it back out from.For 4.4.0 branch forward, there seems to be issues with the Writer style:graphic-properties in the content.xml and the styles.xml It seems like the XML of a coincident image frame and text frame are conflicting, and when the document is being saved back to its ODF archive something is being dropped in writing the XML. On reopen transparency and area fill have changed. The image frame is loosing color for area fill (resetting to white), and also some of the transparency elements. It will hold other area fill types.It also seems that with introduction of transparency for image frame--the Image dialog Wrap -> Through -> In bac~kground is being set--but the frame for the image is conflicting with the coincident text frame drawing layer. If the text frame is assigned an area fill (Color, Gradient, Hatching, or Bitmap) and a transparency value--then the image frame will correctly render. But if an text frame area fill NONE is set, the coincident image frame will not render the image and its frame will show opaque. Unfortunately setting transparency of the text frame is cleared to no transparency when the document is saved and reopened. So the image shows opaque. The issue of sample document provided by OP.Also, the text frame with a Color area fill will reset to color White.Resetting NEW and adding to mab4.4The Writer Frames refactoring is a nice bit of work, but looks to still need some tweaks.

id=87369	When saving a document where a frame has a background colour, this colour is changed to white on saving.How to replicate:1. Create a new document (or edit an old one).2. Create a new frame. (As a side note, trying to choose Colour at this point usually doesn't work.)3. Frame > Area > Fill > Colour > choose any colour other than white.4. Save the document.5. Close the document.6. Re-open the document.What happens:* The frame's colour has changed to white (confirmed with Frame > Area).What should happen:* The frame retains the chosen colour.This has been tested on both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit with LibreOffice 4.4.0.0.beta2.This bug is more serious than it sounds, because it can take a tremendous amount of work to keep resetting the colours of several frames in a document. For example, I have one document used for a community, containing nine non-white frames and edited thousands of times (no exaggeration) per year. That potentially would equate to over a million frame fixes over its (so far) ten-year lifespan. Confirmed under mint 17 x64 with 4.4.0.0.beta2 Build ID: be92f32b8f21603a6b7a75dd645f7475bdee519dColor has changed to white when *loading* the file, not saving.You can see the correct color if you load it in another, older version.@MM Thank you.I confirm that I have the same results as you, loading with version 4.3.4.1.I shall edit the original report to reflect this.Ohâ¦ I can't edit the original report.Load the file saved with 4.4 with 4.3 for example and resave it to another name. Now, if you copy over content.xml from the '4.3' file to the '4.4' file, it can be imported in 4.4 again.@MM, I have duplicated what you suggested.Unfortunately, of course, as soon as you make a change and re-save the document in 4.4, it again loads as white.The difference between the two content.xml files seems to be the addition in the version 4.4 file of the following line (replace #c5000b with your chosen colour):draw:fill-color="#c5000b" draw:fill-image-width="0in" draw:fill-image-height="0in"I don't know enough about .xml files to be able to comment why this should prevent version 4.4 from using the chosen colour. But, the information should at least help the developers to find and fix the bug.This is a serious regression that should not make it into 4.4.0. I can confirm this behavior in 4.4.0.1 rc. I'll mark it as a regression and up the importance to high. If this was regarding a released version, it would warrant an importance of blocker according to the bug prioritization flowchart.I bibisected:62e81d8a4ea612991512b908f80f3b40230ba9ef is the first bad commitcommit 62e81d8a4ea612991512b908f80f3b40230ba9efAuthor: Bjoern Michaelsen <>Date: Thu Nov 6 02:27:20 2014 +0000 source-hash-d8e21f0400c5ae77e388ef81b7fcad9f65401c65 commit d8e21f0400c5ae77e388ef81b7fcad9f65401c65 Author: Stephan Bergmann <> AuthorDate: Tue Sep 30 08:24:10 2014 +0200 Commit: Stephan Bergmann <> CommitDate: Tue Sep 30 10:33:25 2014 +0200 compilerplugins: get rid of std::auto_ptr in comment Change-Id: Ia2b1bc97f3476da7bfbe659e5160cd5c73c01ce5:100644 100644 5c3813bbffcc1a973d54c24b9344a27004b8e8d4 3c6de89b42d551444e7249b54f84c458f0131f8f M ccache.log:100644 100644 603d4f7a782b36e2f744e3f1b7ae0d15f3267ee0 a01b9c064d6d47bf8377eb49bc32be6ba3efd54c M commitmsg:100644 100644 04bc02ea6b9a198280636d812dadf526391078a0 bd57af0b2b70f65eeb4e4e24d93e7f3d2dc31736 M make.log:040000 040000 b4c02035df8301972581e0df7ca439311ef4d5d2 a9c2ee18b91f9f5f64bde6f0231d616c6678b773 M opt$ git bisect log# bad: [4a3091e95fa263d3e2dd81e56e83996f0bb12287] source-hash-2b5b04e1e62914bf0902dfd7943cdc44499c47a6# good: [812c4a492375ac47b3557fbb32f5637fc89d60d9] source-hash-dea4a3b9d7182700abeb4dc756a24a9e8dea8474git bisect start 'latest' 'oldest'# good: [5d0dfb8e62ae61a240f8313c594d4560e7c8e048] source-hash-0c6cd530de13f80795881f61064f1bf1dcc4ea81git bisect good 5d0dfb8e62ae61a240f8313c594d4560e7c8e048# good: [7dfacd0b8bd828331d74c0f79de6e8924bc4e6a5] source-hash-f93ce4f7eb90093d0ea3115d0a1c614612676dbdgit bisect good 7dfacd0b8bd828331d74c0f79de6e8924bc4e6a5# bad: [a42da134cd542144fca7ba14cce86c2b409fc18a] source-hash-beadebc0f7eb5582fcb8dcb082d19afdf2751876git bisect bad a42da134cd542144fca7ba14cce86c2b409fc18a# bad: [5f697ca821720f76105e5539f0408e68a0647481] source-hash-f9695150942341a755a43996d4639eb623d7640bgit bisect bad 5f697ca821720f76105e5539f0408e68a0647481# bad: [3b00b662438462a4b73b0531ffa6192fc7e72638] source-hash-0a5cd87e591d7f87bfab92716079af719259f143git bisect bad 3b00b662438462a4b73b0531ffa6192fc7e72638# good: [b4320c4383b3d61076ac1794797bd3162612889d] source-hash-da21f7da44dc577a08ea3bc210083dc8decf18bcgit bisect good b4320c4383b3d61076ac1794797bd3162612889d# good: [e1690f3a96306b42e829d63cb23a48e4b90603b5] source-hash-3d394257945f6b0a4bc4b5ea397a3942a59c5d06git bisect good e1690f3a96306b42e829d63cb23a48e4b90603b5# bad: [62e81d8a4ea612991512b908f80f3b40230ba9ef] source-hash-d8e21f0400c5ae77e388ef81b7fcad9f65401c65git bisect bad 62e81d8a4ea612991512b908f80f3b40230ba9ef# good: [8d288df76cd45312945404c1805ffae2418a27a8] source-hash-26f2da07b1c6074e519d28557a3d1d5518ff6cb4git bisect good 8d288df76cd45312945404c1805ffae2418a27a8# first bad commit: [62e81d8a4ea612991512b908f80f3b40230ba9ef] source-hash-d8e21f0400c5ae77e388ef81b7fcad9f65401c65CreatedTest file (background of frame should be violet)The behaviour seems to have changed as of the below commit.Adding Cc: to; Could you take a look at this one?

When you switch the language style to English, LO crashes.good news: not reproducible anymore in current build of both master as well as libreoffice-5-0In other words: While I can reproduce with beta3, I can no longer with code that will end up as rc1 - so I assume it was fixed in the meantime along with another change.I cannot reproduce with my Windows --enable-64-bit --enable-dbgutil master build from last night either. (But also couldn't reproduce in the past, as I had failed to configure --with-myspell-dicts in the past, so had had no spell checking dictionaries to begin with.)Bug can still be reproduced in LO 5.0.0.1 win x64 build (currently on pre-release server - jun 20). As Christian pointed out, switching off the spell-checker does indeed provide a workaround that enables writer to run. I guess this means that whatever had solved the problem in master hasn't made it to the RC build. :(As a follow up on Christian's workaround, only the 'Lightproof module' and 'check grammar while typing' option need to be turned off.The immediate crash will only reproduce with the realtime 'lightproof checker' enabled and the 'check while typing option' selected. With the lightproof module available and realtime switched off, a manual grammar check (f7) causes the crash.With lightproof off and realtime grammar off, auto and manual Spell checking functions without any problems and the hyphenation / thesaurus behave as expected.In my case, System language / dictionaries and documents being opened are all in English.This should be fixed now with <> "MSVC 64-bit: In queryInterface optimization, copy hidden ret val addr" towards LibreOffice 5.0. (Same underlying problem as.)(In reply to Christian Lohmaier from)The underlying bug was that a certain function should return in RAX a specific value that is already known to the caller, but instead returned garbage in RAX. Whether the caller wants to actually make use of that value returned in RAX (which it does not really need, as it already knows the value) may depend on details like --enable-debug configuration etc. That might explain that some builds exhibited actual problems while others didn't.Wow - great fix Stephan =) I'm surprised our unit tests didn't pick it up though.(In reply to Michael Meeks from)I was surprised too, but also note.Confirm resolved inVersion: 5.0.0.3 (x64)Build ID: f79b5ba13f5e6cbad23f8038060e556217e66632Locale: en-GB (en_GB)

There is no crash.This is a major regression.thanks for feedback. what about exiting the presentation? do you have the same secondary monitor taskbar focus issue I described under Windows? seetested in 5002 on Ubuntu 32 bitsNo presenter console.No crash.After the presentation, when I use Ctrl+` , to toggle between active LibreOffice windows, I do see an *empty* window, just the *frame* and for the *transparent*.(In reply to Cor Nouws from)I do see an *empty* window, just the *frame* and for the rest *transparent*.thanks Cor, are you able to exit the slideshow without using keyboard shortcuts?there's should be an "exit presentation" or something like that at the end of it.(In reply to tommy27 from)Yes, if I click it exits presentation mode(In reply to Cor Nouws from)And after closing the presentation document, the empty window remains(Sorry, can't take a screen shot of the ghost window :) )ok, but what about the "focus" of the LibO application? does it remains on the secondary monitor like in Windows (which makes impossible to select anything in the primary monitor... not only LibO, but also taskbar etc. etc.) or stays on the primary monitor allowing to work with LibO and other apps?(In reply to tommy27 from)Something weird with focus ongoing too here.But I expect (maybe too optimistic) that one bug in the software may have various effects, depending on OS, set up etc etc..Not working as expected confirmed for me under Linux Ubuntu 15.04 with a dual screen.Just tested with Version: 5.0.0.2.0+Build ID: 50b93a183bcdd9981a740a92cd5cc6be77be1973Ubuntu_15.04_x86-64Locale : fr-FR (fr_FR.UTF-8)built at home.The bad behaviour is different depending on whether you use VCL plugin GTK3 (default) or GTK2.GTK3: the screen of the speaker is emptyGTK2: the screen of the speaker is a duplicate of the edit window.For both closing the slide-show does not go back to the edit mode.I did not experienced a crash. Same behaviour for the master.Best regards. JBFthanks for testing.the crash was probably some other bug present at the time of the initial report but has not been reproduced subsequently either on Windows and Linux (a Mac user is still reporting a crash) while the issues of presenter console visualization and slideshow exit are still presentIt doesn't crash for me (dual screen), presenter console is shown on the primary screen, but I'm loosing focus (and mouse responding) on primary screen.A way to retrieve focus on primary screen, is to open a terminal on secondary screen, and manually kill soffice.binVersion: 5.1.0.0.alpha1+Build ID: a28231b72b5a87dddffad82a34deac4e5bb76ed1TinderBox: Linux-rpm_deb-x86_64@46-TDF, Branch:master, Time: 2015-07-02_06:22:36Locale: fr-FR (fr_FR.UTF-8)GUI Toolkit tested : gen, gtk, gtk2, gtk3, kde, kde4Distrib : Xubuntu 14.10Ubuntu's Kernel package : 3.16.0-41-generic (x86_64)May this specific issue should be tracked by a new bug, "on graphics stack" component ?Christian Lohmaier committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":tdf#91574 fix presenter console not displayedIt will be available in 5.1.0.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

Will have a look and try to get it into RC3.I've had a further wrestle with this ... the slideshow and worse sdext/ code is some of the most -horribly- tangled stuff I've seen in libreoffice's VCL usage. No wonder its under-responsive & performs poorly ;->Anyhow - it seems that the proximate cause of the non-rendering is that:CanvasUpdateRequester::RequestUpdate is not called on Windows, at least until we get an invalidate from something eg. a mouse-over causing a re-render of the canvas-based presenter-console toolbar. It seems there is also something of a delay here on Linux too which makes it easier to chase but even so ... the code maketh one cry.I have not updated the nightly build yet, but still seeing this issue in the RC from the PPA, which updated between last night and today.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***More reading of the pure over-engineered horrors in the impress code-base =) Turns out that this is specific to the DX canvas. If we disable that Tools->Options->View - and un-check "use hardware acceleration" - life is good again - albeit that it still takes far longer than is remotely feasible to actually render the presenter view - (and the projected slides), but that's nothing too new =) F9 should within a few ms be able to configure both displays to be showing the right thing, but there is a huge pile of code here seemingly designed to avoid things happening sensibly here ;-)Seems to be fixed in the latest RC build from the LibreOffice Pre-release PPA.Works with or without hardware acceleration enabled.@Rolandit's fixed in Linux, we know that.but the bug persists under Windows.still reproducible with LibO 5.1.0.0.alpha1+Build ID: fcdddbd30a8b5cf6a5cc4d2ff28b7d4a20f8ec6bTinderBox: Win-x86@62-merge-TDF, Branch:MASTER, Time: 2015-07-20_02:07:48Locale: en-US (it_IT)Not sure what wasn't clear but I still had the problem after everyone else said ut was fixed.

Unfortunately the Windows problem is really pretty unpleasant, but my hope is the Linux issue is fixed.Well; after yet more wading through the code - I have a fix; the real question is - why does it

I don't know how to explain it technically. But, despite having upgraded from LO 4 to 5, my profile folder remained as "4", as if no upgrade had happened. The solution was: with LO closed, I copied my profile folder to another place, then I deleted the original folder. When I opened LO again it created a new profile folder, solving the problem. I could then copy my profile settings from the old to the new folder. But I didn't feel it was really necessary.I don't know it it does apply to Windows.Good luck!(In reply to Daniel Hora from)Hi Daniel,thank you for pointing me to the non-updated configuration. I removed the directory .config/libreoffice and restarted LO 5.Now the presenter console shows the actual slide and the preview of the next one, and LO can be exited decently.But:1. The background is white instead of black (bad contrast),2. the digits for the time measurement are over-pixeled when they are non-zero,3. and the frame showing the graphical menue (e.g. switch terminals) is present, but only white.Question to the maintainers:Should I open an new bug report?Out of sheer despair I downloaded LO 5 from the libreoffice site, andIT WORKS AS IT SHOULD!Therefore I ask you not to re-open this bug report.So, it's a bug in the openSuSE distribution of LO 5.0.3. I'll open a bug report with openSuSE.(In reply to Willy Weisz from)Thank you for investigating further and for reporting your findings.For future situations, yes it is preferable to open a new bug report. Even if the problem is seems to be the same, it is preferable to start with a fresh report (no mixing with previous comments/symptoms)

id=93761	Createdinstallation error windowI tried to update from the first x64 5 release to the second release. It failed with an error 1303, the installation procedure could write in the LibreOffice 5 program directory.I could not install the previous version either (same error), and deleting the program folder was impossible to (Damned Windows 10...)So I'm left with no LibreOffice at all :-) Hi Dirk, thanks for reporting.Please take a look to this thread.Resolved as notabug, please if you are not agree reopen it.Thanks for your reply.First of all, I never had to use admin privileges, so this behaviour is different from the many updates I installed before.Secondly, Windows 10 has no "Install as Administrator" option, so that solution doesn't work. I found a way to add this option (the fix is meant for Windows 8), but that doesn't help, the same error.()The elevated administrator account is disabled by default in Windows 10. I enabled it, didn't work either.Even if solutions like these would work, I'm sure you will agree it's not the way consumers should install an office package.Since a first install seems to work, I tried to remove the whole LibreOffice 5 directory tree.I can not delete the program subdirectory, not even in administrator mode:C:\Program Files\LibreOffice 5>rmdir programAccess is denied.C:\Program Files\LibreOffice 5>attrib -r -s programAccess denied - C:\Program Files\LibreOffice 5\programSorry but I think how to admin system security to install a package is not a not something that LIbreOffice can and must modify. I can install with Win10x64, system ask me to allow the installation but that's all.May be some Win configuration option is creating the issue. User without or with limited rights. I think the level established in User Account Control. From 0 to 3 I have level 2.Delete a program like breOffice by hand it's not the way.To remove a program there is as option in the system configuration for Aggregate and Remove programs, where to select the program and remove it, it works fine for me with LIbreOffice.The problem to remove folders, may be is the same limitation than for install or if some LibreOffice program is running in background, the system doesn't allow remove the program file and of course any directory in their path.Perhaps trying to install with a new administrator user, if working in it, could help you to find the differences in the user's rights.This was an upgrade from a previous LibreOffice 5 installation. That installation went fine, no problem what so ever.If I install the package as administrator, then I have the highest privileges, but that doesn't work either.The upgrade procedure will remove the previous LibreOffice version, and that happened. So there's nothing to uninstall. It has left the LibreOffice 5 directory and the empty program subdirectory. For some reason that directory can not be romoved.After a reboot the program subdirectory was gone. It seems the uninstall procedure tried to delete the program directory, but the delete operation did not complete for what ever reason, and left de program subdirectory in an unknown state.Anyway I also deleted the LibreOffice 5 directory, and then did a new attempt to install the new version, and this time I succeeded.Anyway, the procedure you advised in your first reply is not possible for Wind 8, 8.1 en 10. There is no install as administrator option !!As you like, but in any case it was not a LibreOffice bug.Well, the install procedure of the new version calls the uninstall procedure of the previous version. I have the impression that the uninstall procedure wants to delete the program directory, and that went wrong. Maybe it was an unfortunate coincidence, a timing problem, I don't know. But the fact remains it did happen in the install procedure of the new version.The problem remains. When I am going to install a new 64 bit version of libreoffice, I will first remove the old version (with Program remove from Control Panel).The program folder in the libreoffice 5 folder will still be visible after the uninstall, but it can't be used or deleted.After a reboot the program folder is gone, and I can install a new version of libreoffice.My previous comment was 5.0.4. I had to remove 5.1 (had to go back to 5.0.5), and that went fine. Even the Libreoffice folder itself was removed!!This looks like a duplicate ofafter reopening.This behaviour is still present in 5.1.3.2Windows 7, both 32 bit & 64 bit, running as privileged user, not administrator.Either after uninstalling first, or attempting to upgrade a previous version.As noted by others, solution is to reboot to remove the rogue \program directory.*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***

Hi i not dev or something but in your place i will check this:1) I have installed JRE/JDE?2) I run installation from admin account (with his privileges)?3) Your AV my case problem (i have Kaspersky IS 2010 and when i installing i must add to trust - ofc after virus saning and check sums :).Cy.Cy,Thanks for the thoughts. I do have Java installed (Oracle branded, maybe I need to look for another. I seem to remember IBM having one). I re-ran the install in Administrator mode, with the anti-virus (Avast, cannot be turned off, but the active modes can temporarily be disabled, which I did) and the firewall in learning mode. Reboot required again, and when I got back in, same result.Thanks again,KevinOk try this, brows to C:\Documents and Settings\<your_name>\Application Data\ and delete, or zip old folders OpenOffice.org, remove LibereOffice and tray again - this bug is sometime case by old plugins.And remove JRE/JDE from your OS in standard version you have tested JRE - ofc. after installation if will run you must select Tools -> OPTIONS/Preferences -> LO- > Java and restart( actually I using 1.6.0_22 version)-cy.Cy,Ok, I gave this a try. Uninstall LibreOffice. Uninstall Java. Searched C: for any office related files/folders and deleted. Rebooted into Admin mode. Installed LibreOffice. Installed Java (both with firewall in learning mode and anti-virus disabled). Same result.Thanks for the try.KevinI think this my case by:1) Avast, try boot in rescue mode -> after BIOS press F8, it will give two (or more) windows options. one is normal and another one is "Microsoft Windows XP Professional"(Rescue Mode) chose this and tray run LO in this spartan resolution and video acceleration.2)You may have corrupted memory test with this using USB key :or other :3) You can also check your installation filesi Used LibO_3.3.0_beta2_Win_x86_install_multi.exe 6fcd0216b34bd7f18b2caf59f21d702e LibO_3.3.0_beta2_Win_x86_install_multi.exeOr Use bittorent to check integrity :Cy.Cy,I found the issue. LibreOffice worked in safe mode. I ran memtest 4.10 (something I already had) for one full pass, no errors. I then went back into regular Windows and using Task Manager, shut down everything that will shut down (something I do regularly to run MS Flight Simulator for extra memory). LibreOffice then worked.After rebooting, I tried shutting things down one at a time, and trying LibreOffice after each. Online Armor firewall was the culprit, even though I had allowed the install and used learning mode, which should have auto created rules. After some working with the firewall for some time, I managed to get it to agree that LibreOffice was OK. It is now working.It took more than just allowing/trusting soffice.exe and soffice.bin. Each of the different parts (calc.exe etc.) had to be allowed.Thanks for your assistance,KevinClosing Sophie
id=31624	On windows the default install of LibreOffice is not able to load the Flat XML variants (.fodt, .fods, .fodp, etc.) of the ODF files. Please include the requried XML filter and respective file associations with the default install of LibreOffice. For Fridrich?Should we make that XSLT filters included by default (but unselectable)? Will that have any potential negative effect, do they include some broken or usually unwanted functionality? If so, should we move out the flat XML stuff into a component that is included by default?My Server installation of Master "LibO-dev 3.5.0 â WIN7 Home Premium (64bit) English UI [(Build ID: 81607ad-3dca5fd-da627d2)]" has flat.xml filters by default, "LibreOffice 3.4.3 RC2 - WIN7 Home Premium (64bit) German UI [OOO340m1 (Build:302)]" has not. I will check whether tat is an extra option for the installation.@Alex, inpost:Results here might be relevant for.[Reproducible] with "LibreOffice 3.4.3 RC2 - WIN7 Home Premium (64bit) German UI [OOO340m1 (Build:302)]". I modified installation and added xslt filters, but FlatXML still is not assigned to LibO. So those .fodx documents can't be opened from WIN Explorer without problems, but opening via LibO file dialog works without problems (I tested for .fodg).I do not know whether it's planned to install XSLT filters by default, but if the will be installed (also for customized installation) filetype association should be done.Yes, please. I am involved in a project that generates Flat ODF files (.fodt and .fodp) and out-of-the-box support of these file types greatly benefits our use-case.Since all new unconfirmed bugs start in state UNCONFIRMED now and old unconfirmed bugs were moved to NEEDINFO with a explanatory comment, all bugs promoted above those bug states to NEW and later are automatically confirmed making the CONFIRMED whiteboard status redundant. Thus it will be removed.issue is still present on win32 xp, with:LOdev 3.5.0beta2 Build ID: 8589e48-760cc4d-f39cf3d-1b2857e-60db978This is still a problem in LibreOffice 3.5RC2. Because of this Windows users cannot open or export Flat ODF files.Can we please fix this ASAP (preferably before the release of 3.5.0) ?For people having this same issue, you can enable Flat ODF in your LibreOffice installation by rerunning setup and modifying the installation to include: Sample XSLT FiltersSo: setup.exe -> Modify -> Optional Components -> XSLT Sample FiltersShould get you the required filters for using Flat ODF files, but the related file-associations are still not there. The above configuration should become the default on Windows !!Can someone verify this ?I tested on a Windows 7 with the above procedure to enable XSLT Filters and the file associations seem to be there with LibreOffice 3.5RC2, however the XSLT Filters are still not enable by default...<>I understand that it is annoying, so it is perfectly fine to mention it in the most annoying bugs.On the other hand, this is very old bug, workaround is easy => it can't block the 3.5.0 release => lovering severity a bit.Fridrich, any chance to fix this for 3.5.1?(In reply to)It is already fixed in 3-5, now the XSLT filter is default component on Windows.If we need to do another rc, maybe it would be nice to include, but I don't vote for it to be blocker for 3.5.0 if no other stuff pops up.I have described the workaround at. I agree that it should not block the release => closing as fixed.

id=32709	Created2007 PPTX Format Sample Document Created by LibreOffice RC1Hello!I use LibreOffice in my daily work, but I have to exchange documents with MS Office formats (mainly .doc/.xls/.ppt) because all others use MS Office (mainly 2003). So I pay very much attention to try to reduce incompatibility at the utmost.Yesterday I found a problem which LibreOffice has but OOo/Go-oo don't have.The .ppt/.pptx documents created by LibreOffice (both of RC1 and RC2 for Windows and Linux) can't be opened by Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer (with the support of 2007 formats) and Micrsoft Office Web Apps.MS PowerPoint Viewer says that the documents have a problem.MS Office Web Apps warns that the .ppt documents have a potential security problem ("PowerPoint Web App cannot open this presentation because it may contain malicious content. To view or edit this presentation, open it in Microsoft PowerPoint.") and the .pptx documents are broken ("PowerPoint Web App cannot open this presentation because of an error. To view or edit this presentation, open it in Microsoft PowerPoint.").However, MS Office PowerPoint can open these documents.The .ppt/.pptx documents created by OpenOffice.org/Go-oo can be opened by both of MS PowerPoint Viewer and MS Office Web Apps without any warning.LibreOffice RC2 has an other problem about converting an .odp document to a .pptx document. An .odp file of about 500 KB (with a column chart generated from a data sheet) is saved as a .ppt file with the similar size, but it will be saved as a .pptx file with more than 6 MB. (Sorry, I can't attach the specific document.)Thanks for all people's efforts to launch and improve the great project! CreatedPPT Format Sample Document Created by LibreOffice RC1I have the 2 files a try in Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 2010.The ppt file problem is reproducible, while I can play the pptx file with viewer.In addition, open the ppt file with MS Powerpoint and save it again, the PPT Viewer is able to play it. So It would be something different in the LibO version ppt.(In reply to)My ideal is to completely abandon MS Office. I like open-source software and free software, not because they are free of charge but because I love freedom.For exchanging documents with others, I have to pay attention to keeping the layout of the documents with MS Office's proprietary formats. I only use the free tools, MS Word/PowerPoint Viewer and MS Office Web Apps, to know whether the documents are compatible. As for "open the ppt file with MS Powerpoint and save it again", MS PowerPoint of course can open it, but MS PowerPoint Viewer and MS Office Web Apps can't open it. If I need to view the layout, I should find a computer with MS Office? How to let others accept LibreOffice and be free from dependence on MS Office?OpenOffice.org and Go-oo don't have the bug, but I still hope that LibreOffice will be better.LibreOffice 3.3.0 RC3 has the bug, too.(In reply to)OOO330m19 (Build:202) has the bug too, but OpenOffice OOO330m20 (Build:9567) does not. If I save a file in LibreOffice Impress and try to open it in Powerpoint, it complains - "Office has detected a problem with this file. To help protect your computer this file cannot be opened."If I open the same file in OpenOffice 3.3.0 as above, and then resave, it opens in Powerpoint viewer without any problem or error message.Open the OOo generated ppt file again in LOo and resave and the same message applies. "Office has detected a problem with this file. To help protect your computer this file cannot be opened."Reproducible with the .pptx file but NOT the .ppt file.Running:LO 3.3.2 releaseVista SP2 x86.(In reply to)@Zack - What Microsoft product are you using to open the ppt file?(In reply to)I'm using the Microsoft Office PowerPoint viewer.I'm sorry first of all not to be able to supply the documents themselves (business stuff I can't post). I'm working on getting a version I can strip somehow of data and make it reproducible. The problem is that after opening a .ppt document in libre office, powerpoint opens it but hangs as soon as an edit is made. We have worked around this by uploading to google docs and saving once more from there. On #libreoffice-dev I was told to check if it has any grouped drawings, but it doesn't.This bug has still been active through LibreOffice versions 3.3.2 (including release candidates) and now 3.4b1, 3.4b2 and 3.4b3. It is not and has not been an issue with any OpenOffice releases as far as I am aware - I have tested it on OOo3.3.0, OOo3.3.2 and OOo3.4b1. Obviously something has changed in the LibreOffice file .ppt format that hasn't changed in OpenOffice.The error message I get is this "Office has detected a problem with this file. To help protect your computer this file cannot be opened."The bug is *definitely not* to do with grouped drawings, but rather to do with a Microsoft security update called "Office File Validation" that refuses to open files that aren't precisely to its specification.See the following links;And these ones particularly link this issue to the error message I receive;CreatedImpress Export Test (ODP)This file is a test ODP file generated by LibreOffice 3.4b3.CreatedImpress Export Test (OOo 3.3.0 ppt)This file is an export of the test odp to Powerpoint 97/2000/XP format.

No macros, no fancy templates (using the default "Title slide" template on the top right in Impress), just straight text. I didn't do any formatting, not even changing the default font, just typed the text and saved.Radek, could you please have a look?Yup, I will look at it.Yike, please could you also attach pptx version saved by Go-oo? I would like to check what changed meanwhile.I also created a simple test file (one slide) on ODP format. I opened it with Go-OO and LibreOffice and saved as PPT/PPTX.

Presenters usually do the presentation themselves, so they have MS Office at hands => can't block the 3.4.0 release => reducing the severity a bit. We will do our best to fix this for 3.4.1.It seems to me that this is fairly important as it affects every ppt someone emails to someone else. I would personally view it as a blocker. It was enough of an issue for me that I am currently using OOo 3.4b instead of LO, and have given disks of OOo to several friends who I had installed LO for.It also seems to me that it shouldn't be hard to find what is causing this, as some patch has been applied within a fairly short time frame to introduce this regression before the first release of LibreOffice, it only affects a fairly particular component, and whatever patch was applied was not applied to OpenOffice or Go-OOo.So in my view it should be possible to look at all the patches applied to powerpoint exports in the time shortly before LO, and compare which of these have been applied or not to OOo. If someone has access to both code bases and knows how to build LO, you would possibly have to test no more than 5 patches (a guess) to eliminate which has caused this. I used to do this for Inkscape all the time, but unfortunately I haven't got the time to get up to speed for LO/OOo.PPTX files saved from Go-OO 3.2, LibreOffice 3.3.2, LibreOffice 3.4 rc1 all open in MS PowerPoint Viewer 2010. None of those PPTX files open in MS Web Office. This is bug#1: PPTX files saved from LibreOffice do not open in MS Web Office (corrupted contents).PPT file saved from Go-OO 3.2 opens both in MS PowerPoint Viewer 2010 and MS Web Office.PPT file saved from OOo 3.3 opens both in MS PowerPoint Viewer 2010 and MS Web Office.PPT file saved from LibreOffice 3.3.2 opens neither in MS PowerPoint Viewer 2010 nor in MS Web Office (malicious content).PPT file saved from LibreOffice 3.4 opens neither in MS PowerPoint Viewer 2010 nor in MS Web Office (editing error).Error message in MS PowerPoint Viewer 2010 was always "Office has detected problems with this file. To help protect your computer this file cannot be opened."This is bug#2: regression: PPT files saved from LibreOffice 3.3 and higher cannot be opened in MS PowerPoint Viewer 2010 and MS Web Office.PPT file saved from either LibreOffice 3.3.2 or LibreOffice 3.4 rc1 can be opened in MS PowerPoint 2010 with this warning: "Office has detected a problem with this file. Editing may harm your computer." PPT file saved from either OOo 3.3 or Go-OO 3.2 opens without warning. All test PPTX files open in PowerPoint 2010 without warning.I dumped valid and invalid ppt files and I found that in the invalid file the \x05DocumentSummaryInformation stream was corrupted. When I renamed the stream with hexa editor in order to programs ignore it (\x05DocumentSummaryInformation stream is optional), then the file opened in MS PowerPoint Viewer 2010 and in MS PowerPoint 2010 without warning. Now we need to find out what went wrong with exporting \x05DocumentSummaryInformation stream in the code.@ Petr MladekYour comments don't hold water.What often happens is that presenters give their presentations to someone on a memory stick or CD and they have to hope it is compatible. In other cases people use software to present that integrates lots of individual elements/presentations into a larger run sheet/schedule program that will often use Powerpoint or Powerpoint Viewer as the presentation engine, even if it's behind the scenes of another package. See for example screen monkey, which is merely one example of a whole category of presentation software that is all about the scheduling side of things, but which uses Powerpoint behind the scenes.It seems that TDF are currently looking for corporate backing, but a big company will not back a product that fails to do the most basic functions. To companies, and to individuals, interoperability is a very strongly held ideal. Isn't it one of the key founding principles of TDF? Well, it seems only on paper...(In reply to)I was aware of this.This is not true. Please note that LO has switched to time based releases. You might read the following at:--- cut ---The time based release makes happy all type of users. Enthusiasts start using X.Y.0 releases with lovely new features and known bugs. While more conservative users are later attracted by the frequent pure bug fix releases. Even the most conservative users is satisfied by a later bug fix releases, e.g. X.Y.3. --- cut ---This bugs is the 6th most important bug in the list of most annoying bugs. I am pretty sure that we will fix it before LO-3.4.3 release. I guess that corporate users are the most conservative ones. They need to wait for 3.4.2 or 3.4.3 anyway.Radek, any chance to get this fixed for 3.4.2?I have fixed it just now in master branch and will send for review.I have fixed the PPT export, if I understand it correctly the PPTX export was OK. Please test and let me know if you still experience problems.Createdversion exported with build from master branchThanks Radek!

My belief is that it has to do with PPT documents containing OLE objects. LO has made huge advancements in 3.5 release to read OLE objects (e.g. charts created in excel/calc), but it is not currently writing them back in a format that MS Office (or Google Docs) can read. I have some example documents that I will upload shortly that clearly illustrate the problem.OOO doesn't have the problem because it can't read those OLE objects properly in the first place, so doesn't make any mistakes writing them back!!-RSBut this problem persists even there're no OLEs in the document.Hi,Yes, this problem happens with documents containing OLE objects, and documents without OLE objects alike.I have attached the follow four test presentations:1) The original - "Test presentation - original.pptx" - this opens in MS Office for Mac 2008, and in LO 3.5.32) The original opened in LO, and reserved by LO without making any changes (as MS Office 2007-2010 format (.pptx)) - "Test presentation - original - saved by LO.pptx". This does NOT open in MS Office - I get the error "Powerpoint cannot read the presentation ...", followed by "Powerpoint cannot open ... because part of the file is missing"3) The odp version of the presentation, saved by LO - - "Test presentation - saved by LO.odp". 4) I finally opened the odp in 3 above in LO, and saved as .pptx in LO (2007-2010 format) - "Test presentation - first saved as odp, then reopened and saved as pptx by LO.pptx". This file now opens in MS Office but I get errors for slides 2 and 3 - "Powerpoint cannot read ...". These come up as blank sides, slides 1, 4 and 5 come up ok.CreatedOriginal MS Office pptx presentationCreatedoriginal MS Office pptx resaved as pptx without changes by LOCreatedODP version of the document, converted by LOCreatedPPTX version of the document, created by opening the ODP version in LO (from the previous step), and saving-as MS office 2007-2010 (pptx format)Looks like there're no volunteers to fix this since more than a year.Can this feature be marked experimental? Otherwise the market share of LO is going to downgrade from 5% to 0.5%.Way to go:Looks like it's best to edit a (XML) file that exhibits this bug manually to remove one line after the other until the Problem ceases to exist, then we know what the part looks like thats the trigger.But in order to do so, I need some kind of ,,Lossless'' Editor that can edit pptx files on a xml level and does only change things you intend to change, so i need a program which can do this, best a one that only decompresses the files to plain readable XML text and back, and for the case that it turns out to be an error on the compression level it would be helpful if that program would be open source... and LEAN! (in this case, such a finding could be a step forward anyway...)Does somebody know such a program he could recommend to me?It may happen that its NOTOURBUG but we must find it out.I have looked at this bug again, but didn't found anything wrong with validator and 2010 MSO loads the IET.pptx file fine. Unfortunately I don't have MSO2003 at hand.I have fixed similartoday, so there is a slight chance it might help with 2003 issue as well. No way to test it here.Lennard, if you want to try edit pptx, emacs works nicely for that. What I usually do is I 1st unpack the pptx file, so that I reformat it nicely with xmlint, I do it with fxreformat function (put this in your .bashrcfxreformat() { find | egrep '\.(xml|rels)$'|while read i; do xmllint -format $i > $i.new; rm $i; mv $i.new $i; done}), run fxreformat in unpacked directory and pack it again. Then I just open the archive in emacs and edit it and save it as I need.Arrgh, I'm such a fool, I didn't know that theyre zip files.(This solves my request, of course)However, just unzipping and rezipping it with winrar didn't change anything.I'm doing tests on it - Can you mail me your pathch forso that I can use that patch in my tests?

One is the one directly saved with Libre Office, the other contains all changes I had to make until *MS Open XML converter* accepted it, namely:1. renumbering some rID's in >>presentation.xml and presentation.xml.rels<< not to start at 2 but 1,2. renumbering <p:sp> <p:cNvPr id='s (who started at id="0") to higher numbers in slidemaster1.xml and slidemaster1.xml.rels3. Excluding the twelveth - and LibreOffice created! - slideLayout12.xml from the r:id="rId<...>" enumeration. Libo_resaved_patched.pptx THIS attachement is the DAMAGED formbest_repair.pptx The most minimalist repair effort I tried that succeeded.I couldn't repair the file by just REMOVING the added slideLayout12.xml from the references, or substituting it with a modified slideLayout3.xml.That means, there must be something going bad with the numbering.By the way: I couldn't save the MS-Originated pptx file (not included) as ppt with Radek-patched LO! not even with .odp in-between.By the way, >>noch heil<< means >>still intact<< in german, not something evil.In the latest master of LO, writing .ppt files (by saving an MSO 2010 Originated pptx file) returned an error that the file couldn't be created.The error had not occurred when using some ?branch? where the stem directory was called ,,libo'' instead of ,,core''. (don't know how I got that).That file could be opened by MS Power Point Viewer 2010 without trouble.With that same version, the repectively saved pptx file returned an error in XML converter.but right now, you cant save a .ppt file that WAS originally a MSO 2010 pptx file.greetingsCreatedAnother exampleI am also seeing this bug in 3.5.4.2. I've added another attachment in hopes that this will help the debugging. These are some slides that I originally did in MS Powerpoint 2008, but I later edited in LO 3.5.4.2 and Powerpoint is not reporting them as corrupted in both the Mac and Windows version. The corruption does not appear on the first slide, but instead one of the later slides.Thanks for your work on this bug. It is essentially blocking me from using LibreOffice and Linux for my lecture prep.Dont restrict the occurrences. It is known to fail on windows and 32 bit, too!Currently I am trying to fix this export issue by searching for incompatibilities that make differences in the content. Maybe that will solve it anyway, but as soon as I learn enough about numbering, I will try to change something about numbering as this obviously solves the export issue, but maybe that just hides that the real problem is somewhere else.By the way, do we neeed to set it on the latest version? the we could -perhaps - set it to 4.0, too, I am afraid...It is true that the version number entered should show the FIRST occurrence, isnt it?(In reply to)No.This problem doesn't persist with 3.6.4.3(In reply to)>So you say it is fixed for you starting 3.6.4.3 ?(In reply to)Yes.Due to the last comment I am marking this as RESOLVED - FIXED. Usually we would put WORKSFORME as we don't know the patch that fixed the issue but so many people confirmed that it was an issue on 3.5 series that FIXED seems more accurate.3.5 is at end of life so whatever fixed the issue in 3.6 will not be ported back to 3.5 series. Thanks for confirming that the issue is resolved.

id=33970	I installed LibreOffice 3.3 on a standard image with Windows XP SP3 for a small private school. I am able to run it as a non-administrative user before it's joined to a domain. Once I join the machine to the domain, a non-admin user cannot start LibreOffice; it gives one of two errors:The application cannot be started.[context="bundled"] caught unexpected exception!orThe application cannot be started.[context="user"] caught unexpected exception!with the second error being more common. I did not modify the selection of components to install; I used the typical installation. The standard image used to have OpenOffice 3.3 installed, but I did a clean uninstall of OOo before installing LibreOffice.Some online research shows that other people are having the same problem. For example, see.For reference, OpenOffice 3.3 has exactly the same issue.My environment has roaming profiles and redirected folders. I've not yet tried messing with group policy to see how LibreOffice reacts; I plan to, but I wanted to open the bug ASAP. I will eagerly try whatever ideas you have, as the private school would love to get LibreOffice working. Issue report for OOo:Tor, any idea what could be the problem?I quote from the OOo issue: "It looks like a problem related to theUNC path used for the user profile within the deployment library which isresponsible for extensions."***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***I can confirm this bug (WinXP Pro SP3). Everything works nice when using a local sysadmin profile, however usage of a roaming profile triggers the two exceptions listed above. The issue persists in LibO 3.3.1 RC1.Having reviewed the list of other blocker and critical LO bugs, I've raised this issue's importance.On a related note, the equivalent OOo bug has been marked to be fixed by OOo 3.4.It would be nice if we could fix this in 3.3.2. Does anybody know a way to reproduce it on a non-domain-member machine?Tor, not sure about that, but here's an alternate approach: teach me to build the source from git for the Windows platform. Assuming the issue was introduced sometime during LibreOffice's lifetime, I could bisect to the offending commit.Or, build me the first revision from git and I'll try it.Right now I cannot find any build-for-Windows instructions on libreoffice's site.andshould get you started. Then come to the IRC channel #libreoffice on freennode, or ask specific questions on the libreoffice mailing list. We very much want to help people in learning to build it!I have done some testing with the following betas of LibO 3.3:- beta 1 (2010-09-27, OOo330m7, Build 9526, OOo-build 2010-09-24)- beta 2 (2010-10-11, OOo330m9, Build 1, libreoffice-build 3.2.99.2)- beta 3 (2010-11-15, OOo330m12, Build 2, libreoffice-build 3.2.99.3)All of them start-up normally in a local user context but produce the errors described above when used with roaming profiles. In addition, beta 1 sometimes gave the following error:The application cannot be startedA general error occurred while accessing your central configurationTo me this suggests that this bug was probably introduced before the OOo/LibO fork, which would be in line with OOo330 facing the same problem.This bug still exists in LibreOffice 3.3.1 RC2 (2011-02-18). This is sad that it existed in 3.3 final release. It is very disturbing that it exists in RC2 for another release. I am happy to test out nightlies or what not. I have several domains with XP SP3, Vista (latest SP) and 7 (latest).I would help with the code/build, but it has been ages since I had MSVC setup on any machines and used it.No need to point out that the bug has not been fixed; if it had, we (developers) would have marked it as fixed here.Nobody can figure out a way to reproduce the problem on a non-domain-member machine (but with other Windows machines in the same workgroup, if needed)? That would obviously be very useful so that this can be debugged.Due to the fact that the bug seems to be with roaming profiles, I am not sure you can reproduce it any other way. I am using Samba 4 for the server if that is the problem. If it is because you don't have Pro/Business/Enterprise/Ultimate clients, I am not sure how to go about doing it.Many of the people who would be interested and capable of debugging this, including me, have access to MSDN, so if really really necessary, sure, I can set up a domain between two virtual machines. It's just a pain to do just for some debugging of what no doubt turns out to be a very easy to fix error once you find the root cause.Hmm, actually, I might have a domain set up in a vmware virtual machine running Windows Server 2003 I haven't started for ages, will have to check. I could then set up roaming progiles, however one does that (I don't have any Windows domain sysadmin experience), and join another virtual machine to that domain, and debug LibreOffice on that. But that will have to wait until I get back from vacation next week.LibreOffice 3.3.0 and 3.3.1 gets fatal error if %appdata% is redirected.Also happens with OpenOffice 3.3.Only happens if the user never started LibreOffice before %appdata% wasredirected, the user has no problems if LibreOffice was started before %appdata%was redirected.Seems like the problem lies in %appdata%\LibreOffice.I have tried to rename %appdata%\LibreOffice on a user that LibreOffice wasworking for (did use LibreOffice before %appdata% was redirected), thenLibreOffice generated it again and Fatal error.Put back the working %appdata%\LibreOffice folder and everything works.Have tested this on Windows 2003 and 2008 R2 terminal servers.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***(In reply to)I can confirm this. I changed the group policy to redirect Application Data back to the user's profile (while leaving all other redirections in place), and the problem is solved.So, on a machine that is not a member of a domain, to reproduce the problem, it is enough to set the APPDATA environment variable to a UNC path before starting LibreOffice the first time?just run into this bug on linux after upgrading from 3.3.0 to 3.3.1...something is wrong with my config in .libreoffice may be some locking problem?this suprisingly solved it for me:mv ~/.libreoffice ~/.libreoffice.xxxcp -vax ~/.libreoffice.xxx ~/.libreofficesounds and looks stupid but it now works again 8)i also tried moving it back:rm ~/.libreofficemv ~/.libreoffice.xxx ~/.libreofficeand it stopped working again..my home is on a NFS3 Server so i suggest some locking problem but i don't have the time right now for further investigation..(like tracing NFS traffic or removing files one by one from .libreoffice) ..but i still have my ~/.libreoffice.xxx to test again later..i am using a linux from scratch based distribution with kernel 2.6.35.10 and glibc 2.12.1.. arch=x86_64.. libreoffice is installed using the rpms for 64bit linux downloaded from the official website..may be this information helps solving this bug.. i can provide more information if needed later..bye.. marius tolzmann..i forgot to mention that the problem still existed after downgrading to 3.3.0 again..Marius, whatever problem you have on Linux, it has nothing at all to do with what this bug report is about. This bug report is about a Windows-specific issue. Please file a separate bug.PÃ¥l, when you say "LibreOffice 3.3.0 and 3.3.1 gets fatal error if %appdata% is redirected" what do you mean exactly? (I asked the same question to you in the OOo issue, see details there...)I would very much like to fix this, but first I need to reproduce it, on a machine that is not a member of a domain.It's interesting that even if I set an APPDATA environment variable in Control Panel:System:Advanced:Environment Variables, if I then run cmd.exe, it still has the normal value for APPDATA (C:\Documents and Setings\N.N\Application Data , on XP). So is APPDATA treated specially, does cmd.exe override any setting of it in its environment? Does explorer.exe ignore attempts to set APPDATA?If nobody can come up with a way to reproduce this in a non-domain-member machine, could somebody at least give *exact* instructions how to set up "roaming profiles" and "redirected folders" when I have a Windows Server 2008 R2 running with the Active Directory Domain Services role activated, and have joined a XP workstation to that domain. (Both are virtual machines, and yes, I can ping one from the other.)If you want this problem fixed, please at least help me to reproduce it! You who have the problem, can't you ask your sysadmin to write here a step-by-step guide how to set up a minimal temporary test domain with "roaming profiles" and "redirected folders", huh? Or are you attempting to use LibreOffice without the sysadmins knowing?This is from a windows XP perspective. I do not have the updated instructions in front of me:Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools (Common), and then click User Manager for Domains or Active Directory Users and ComputersSelect all relevant users, right-click one of the users, and then click Properties.Click on ProfileUser Profile Path type â\\SERVER_NAME\profiles\%USERNAME%â in the box, and then click OK. User Home Path type â\\SERVER_NAME\homes\%USERNAME%â in the box, and drive letter and then click OK. Right click on domain, do new GPO for full domain1. User Configuration/Folder Redirection/My Documents to drive letterDefault Policy/User Configuration/Windows Settings/Folder Redirection/AppDataBasicCreate a folder for each user under the root path\\%FILESERVER%.%DOMAIN\appdataSettings: Grant user exclusive, move contents, also apply to 2000, XP, etc., leave when deletedDefault Domain GPO "Exclude Directories in roaming profile"appdata is a share I setup, btw.Thanks. There were indeed a couple of points there that I wouldn't have realized myself. Will try that out tomorrow. If anybody else has more hints, please add comments!Sorry, forgot a few others %FILESERVER%.%DOMAIN are not real variables. They are just my way of remembering in my own instructions. %USERNAME% is a real one.In WS2008R2, the "Profile" tab of the domain user properties has one entry box for "Profile path", so that should be \\%server%\profiles\%username% as you say inthen, OK. (Where %server% and %username% are replaced with the actual server and user names.) This is fairly clear.Do I need to create this "profiles" share on the server beforehand, and set its owner to the domain user in question? Or is "profiles" some kind of "magical" share name?But then about the "Home folder", it is not so clear. There are two alternatives here, "Local path" and "Connect" (connect a drive letter to what I assume should be a UNC path). You mean I should use the latter alternative? Should I then create the "homes" share you mention and a subdirectory for the user under it, or will it be created automatically when the user logs in to a domain member?I already yesterday had entered into "Profile path" a UNC path to a directory for the user I had created on the server (and left the "Home folder" entries empty), but when I logged in on the domain member machine, it complained it couldn't connect to the profile folder, or something like that. I guess I should try to figure out that first, or will filling in the "Home folder" stuff automatically make that work OK, too?Thanks in advance for any further advice...I think my current problem now is firstly to make it possible for the XP domain member to see and mount shares on the ws2008r2 server... that seems to require some extra trick I haven't figure out yet, I just get error 5 if I try "net view \\server" or "net use \\server\scratch x: /user:foo" where scratch is a share I made as wide-open as possible, and foo is a domain user. Hmm....The homes share is a share I created. For me (XP, Vista, 7) it auto-creates the path for the user when you set it up, but you do have to create the share. And yes, I meant where you connect a drive letter to a UNC.Profiles I think is magic if you are using Windows, but I do NOT know that. I have to set it up manually as I am using Samba 4. (may or may not help as it is where I got a lot of the information, or at least where I started from.)If you setup the paths correctly and they point to valid shares, then everything should automatically work. At least it does here for me.OK, after explicitly creating the appdata\%username%, homes\%username% and profile\%username% folders on the server and making sure that user has max permissions to them and is their owner I think I got it working to some extent. At least I now can log in to the client without warnings.But the AppData is still not redirected, I still see the LibreOffice folder being created in the XP client locally in C:\Documents and Settings\%username%\Application Data .Maybe I really need to set up a Windows 7 client? (Unfortunately the one Windows 7 virtual machine I already have is in Chinese (I once wanted to check how something worked in a Chinese localisation...), and that is a bit hard to use...)Ok, I think you must have failed to setup a GPO that applies to the user in question (mine are all domain wide at this time).In group policy editor do the following (some things may be different if you are setting things up on Windows Vista/7 vs XP, so if the client is XP, do it there, also some locations may be correct for Vista/7, others for XP so you may have to search a bit):Default Policy/User Configuration/Windows Settings/Folder Redirection/AppDataBasicCreate a folder for each user under the root path\\%FILESERVER%.%DOMAIN\appdataSettings: Grant user exclusive, move contents, also apply to 2000, XP, etc.,leave when deletedDefault Domain GPO "Exclude Directories in roaming profile"I think on the local machine it may show things still being in that directory as some of them are remapped, the question is to see if it exists in appdata\%USERNAME% on the server.Check the APPDATA environment variable as well, see if it changed.(In reply to)I have replied in the OOo issue but I reply here too.I mean I have used Group Policy in Windows Active Directory Domain to create apolicy that redirects everyone's appdata folder to the same location, alsocalled roaming.The reason I do this is that we have terminal servers at work and a lot of datais stored at appdata, if we did not redirect appdata it would be copied to theterminal server every time they logon witch give a longer logontime.This is how I have set up the redirect policy.Windows server 2008 R2 -> Group Policy Management -> New Policy -> Userconfiguration\Policies\Windows Settings\Folder Redirection\AppData(Roaming):Target:Setting = Basic - Redirect everyone's folder to the same location.Target folder location = Create a folder for each user under the root path.Root path = \\server\usersSettings (enabled):On - Move the contents of AppData(Roaming) to the new location.On - Also apply redirection policy to Windows 2000, Windows 2000 Server,Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 operating systems.On - Leave the folder in the new location when policy is removed.Ex. For user Clair, this folder will be redirected to:\\server\users\Clair\Application dataPÃ¥l, ok, so you use the normal \users folder on the server for the redirected app data. Should it be possible to reproduce the problem using *only* the redirected app data folder like that (and \users then shared, presumably)? I.e. redirection of "documents" is not needed, nor is it needed to set up separate homes, profiles or appdata shares? What do you do for profiles, do you set up anything in the "Profile" tab of the domain user properties?I prefer to have an as minimal way as possible to reproduce the problem.(In reply to)When you say the normal \users folder on the server do you think of C:\Users?If so I do not use the normal users folder on the server.I have created a personal home folder for every user, lets call it homes instead of users. This folder is then shared and every user has it's own personal folder in here for personal stuff that only that person and domain admins has access to.AppData(Roaming) Target Root path = \\server\homesEx. For user Clair, this folder will be redirected to:\\server\homes\Clair\Application dataI also redirect Desktop, Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos folders to \\server\homes, but this should not have anything to do with LibreOffice/OOo error!The only thing I do in the "Profile" tab of the user properties is:Home folder, Connect = H: to \\server\homes\%username%The User profile, Profile path is blank!OK, thanks. I was misunderstanding your.This seems to be fixed in the Oracle OO 3.4 alpha that has just been releasedIs the plan to try and fix this for 3.3.3 or 3.4. As a XP site with 500+machines this bug is a complete show stopper. :-(MGreat, will have to look how they fixed it then and see if it can easily be adapted to 3.3 (as we presumably will continue releasing new 3.3.x versions once a month or so). But in any case the fix will naturally then be in our 3.4, too. We merge in OOo changes in LibreOffice in general.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***I see no mention in the OOo issue () that it would have been fixed intentionally.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Looks like the problem is solved in OpenOffice.org 3.4 Alpha Release (buildDEV300m101).

I didn't try yet but your instructions sound very promising.Wilco, using c:\test-appdata for that Registry value I had no problem starting LibreOffice.But if I use a UNC path (in my case, \\vmware-host\Shared Folders\tmp\test-appdata) I can indeed reproduce the problem. Yay, finally!Wilco, thanks once more. This kind of trivial way to reproduce the problem was what I was asking for already in.Debugging this now; in case I get interrupted, here is the stack trace at an interesting spot, and some musings:deploymentmi.uno.dll!dp_registry::backend::configuration::ConfigurationBackendDb::getAllDataUrls() Line 144 + 0xf bytes C++ deploymentmi.uno.dll!dp_registry::backend::configuration::`anonymous namespace'::BackendImpl::BackendImpl(const com::sun::star::uno::Sequence<com::sun::star::uno::Any> & args=0x00e9f408 {size=0x00000003}, const com::sun::star::uno::Reference<com::sun::star::uno::XComponentContext> & xComponentContext={...}) Line 216 + 0x16 bytes C++ deploymentmi.uno.dll!cppu::ImplInheritanceHelper1<dp_registry::backend::configuration::`anonymous namespace'::BackendImpl,com::sun::star::lang::XServiceInfo>::ImplInheritanceHelper1<dp_registry::backend::configuration::`anonymous namespace'::BackendImpl,com::sun::star::lang::XServiceInfo><com::sun::star::uno::Sequence<com::sun::star::uno::Any>,com::sun::star::uno::Reference<com::sun::star::uno::XComponentContext> >(const com::sun::star::uno::Sequence<com::sun::star::uno::Any> & arg1=0x00e9f408 {size=0x00000003}, const com::sun::star::uno::Reference<com::sun::star::uno::XComponentContext> & arg2={...}) Line 187 + 0x36 bytes C++ deploymentmi.uno.dll!comphelper::service_decl::detail::OwnServiceImpl<cppu::ImplInheritanceHelper1<dp_registry::backend::configuration::`anonymous namespace'::BackendImpl,com::sun::star::lang::XServiceInfo> >::OwnServiceImpl<cppu::ImplInheritanceHelper1<dp_registry::backend::configuration::`anonymous namespace'::BackendImpl,com::sun::star::lang::XServiceInfo> >(const comphelper::service_decl::ServiceDecl & rServiceDecl={...}, const com::sun::star::uno::Sequence<com::sun::star::uno::Any> & args=0x00e9f408 {size=0x00000003}, const com::sun::star::uno::Reference<com::sun::star::uno::XComponentContext> & xContext={...}) Line 182 + 0x36 bytes C++ deploymentmi.uno.dll!comphelper::service_decl::detail::ServiceImpl<dp_registry::backend::configuration::`anonymous namespace'::BackendImpl>::ServiceImpl<dp_registry::backend::configuration::`anonymous namespace'::BackendImpl>(const comphelper::service_decl::ServiceDecl & rServiceDecl={...}, const com::sun::star::uno::Sequence<com::sun::star::uno::Any> & args=0x00e9f408 {size=0x00000003}, const com::sun::star::uno::Reference<com::sun::star::uno::XComponentContext> & xContext={...}) Line 211 + 0x3a bytes C++ deploymentmi.uno.dll!comphelper::service_decl::detail::CreateFunc<comphelper::service_decl::detail::ServiceImpl<dp_registry::backend::configuration::`anonymous namespace'::BackendImpl>,comphelper::service_decl::detail::PostProcessDefault<comphelper::service_decl::detail::ServiceImpl<dp_registry::backend::configuration::`anonymous namespace'::BackendImpl> >,comphelper::service_decl::with_args<1> >::operator()(const comphelper::service_decl::ServiceDecl & rServiceDecl={...}, const com::sun::star::uno::Sequence<com::sun::star::uno::Any> & args=0x00e9f408 {size=0x00000003}, const com::sun::star::uno::Reference<com::sun::star::uno::XComponentContext> & xContext={...}) Line 263 + 0x31 bytes C++ deploymentmi.uno.dll!boost::detail::function::function_obj_invoker3<comphelper::service_decl::detail::CreateFunc<comphelper::service_decl::detail::ServiceImpl<dp_registry::backend::configuration::`anonymous namespace'::BackendImpl>,comphelper::service_decl::detail::PostProcessDefault<comphelper::service_decl::detail::ServiceImpl<dp_registry::backend::configuration::`anonymous namespace'::BackendImpl> >,comphelper::service_decl::with_args<1> >,com::sun::star::uno::Reference<com::sun::star::uno::XInterface>,comphelper::service_decl::ServiceDecl const &,com::sun::star::uno::Sequence<com::sun::star::uno::Any> const &,com::sun::star::uno::Reference<com::sun::star::uno::XComponentContext> const &>::invoke(boost::detail::function::function_buffer & function_obj_ptr={...}, const comphelper::service_decl::ServiceDecl & a0={...}, const com::sun::star::uno::Sequence<com::sun::star::uno::Any> & a1=0x00e9f408 {size=0x00000003}, const com::sun::star::uno::Reference<com::sun::star::uno::XComponentContext> & a2={...}) Line 131 + 0x18 bytes C++ comphelp4MSC.dll!00edf63a() [Frames below may be incorrect and/or missing, no symbols loaded for comphelp4MSC.dll] comphelp4MSC.dll!00edf6df() cppuhelper3MSC.dll!00370c0c() The m_urlDb at that top of the stack location is "file://vmware-host/Shared%20Folders/tmp/test-appdata/LibreOffice/3/user/uno_packages/cache/registry/com.sun.star.comp.deployment.configuration.PackageRegistryBackend/backenddb.xml" which IMHO is bogus. UNC paths should not be represented as file: URLs where the host part is the server name. More correct would be "file://///vmware-host/Shared%20Folders/..." IMHO. But as such, as long as the conversion from an UNC path to an URL and back results in the same UNC path as it started with, it shouldn't be a problem if the file: URL for the UNC path is bogus. But does it? Debugging...Yeah, I am fairly sure I understand the problem now. It is basically a mismatch between how OOo/LO represents UNC paths as URLs format, and what libxml2 is prepared to handle.The correct syntax for file: URLs on Windows is severely under-specified. Historically even for local file names various incompatible formats have been used, like Mozilla (Netscape?) at some point using | instead of :.But by now, I think the form generally agreed upon for local file names, at least when ASCII only is involved (yeah... a big "only") is file:///x:/rest/of/path , where x: is the drive letter.For UNC paths there is much less consensus. OOo/LO uses the form file://server/share/rest/of/path . But libxml2 does not handle that. Look at the code in xmlIO.c:xmlNoNetExists().Now, this bug would have been *much* easier to solve if only the error handling would have been saner. In unoxml/source/dom/documenthandler.cxx:warning_func(), the nice verbose error message from libxml2 is used, we get libxml2 warningfailed to load external entity "file://vmware-host/Shared%20Folders/tmp/test-appdata/LibreOffice/3/user/uno_packages/cache/registry/com.sun.star.comp.deployment.configuration.PackageRegistryBackend/backenddb.xml"And then in throwEx() in the same file we still have that message around, and it is stored in a com::sun::star::xml::sax::SAXParseException, which is thrown. But that exception is then caught in desktop/source/deployment/manager/dp_manager.cxx:dp_manager::PackageManagerImpl::create() with just: catch (Exception &) { ... }How nice. If the actual exception object would be captured here, we would see that it contains a nice verbose message "Extension Manager: failed to read data entry in configuration backend db: file://vmware-host/Shared%20Folders/tmp/test-appdata/LibreOffice/3/user/uno_packages/cache/registry/com.sun.star.comp." Yes, the URL is truncated (!), but still, showing that to the user would have been more useful than just saying "caught unexpected exception".This problem has been fixed in OOo 3.4 as a side-effect of them fixing their issue, in CWS jl164. Cherry-picking just the lines that help this problem is trivial. Will commit to the libreoffice-3-3 branch after I get one approval. (We presumably don't want to cherry-pick all of that CWS to our 3.3 branch, even if it fixes other symptoms of the same basic problem, too. But so far nobody seems to have reported the other symptoms for us, so maybe they are rare.)Patch:--- desktop/source/deployment/registry/dp_backenddb.cxx+++ desktop/source/deployment/registry/dp_backenddb.cxx@@ -92,7 +92,10 @@ css::uno::Reference<css::xml::dom::XDocument> BackendDb::getDocument() ::osl::File::RC err = ::osl::DirectoryItem::get(m_urlDb, item); if (err == ::osl::File::E_None) {- m_doc = xDocBuilder->parseURI(m_urlDb);+ ::ucbhelper::Content descContent(+ m_urlDb, css::uno::Reference<css::ucb::XCommandEnvironment>());+ Reference<css::io::XInputStream> xIn = descContent.openStream();+ m_doc = xDocBuilder->parse(xIn); } else if (err == ::osl::File::E_NOENT) {+1 for 3.3 from meFixed now in the 3.3 branch.

The document fails to recover with a message Read-Error: Error reading file Reproducable on OSX and Win7.Also occurs in Openoffice 3.3 Also under Linux (OpenSUSE)[Reproducible] with "LibreOffice 3.4.0RC2 â WIN7 Home Premium (64bit) English UI [OOO340m1 (Build:12)]". I created a test document "mytest.doc" and provoked a crash by exporting the document to a .pdf due to "- PDFEXPORT with option "Tagged PDF" crashes WRITER documents". LibO crashed, and when I restarted it during recovery I got some "Read error" message, I do not remember.I checked the backup folder and found a file "mytest.doc_1.odt". When I renamed it to "something.doc" after I had copied it to an other folder LibO was able to open "something.doc" without problems, and the document was a perfect copy of my "mytest.doc" with all contents.So It seems that the name of the recovery copy "mytest.doc_1.odt" is wrong or LibO expects the wrong name or soemthing else.In an additional test I modified the name of the backup document from "__mytest.doc_0.odt" to "__mytest.doc", what was the name of my new sample. but that did not work either, when I started recovery I got an error message "__mytest.doc_0.odt ont available".I also did a similar test with an EXCEL document. You will not believe it, this time my additionally opened .doc and also an .odt have been recovered without problems, but for the excel document I got an error message "Read Error, Unknown or unsupported Excel file format."It seems recovery for MS OFFICE documents is messed up.CreatedScreenshots, SeeThis might cause data loss => we should do our best to fix it for 3.4.1 => increasing severity and priority.(In reply to)Also in Win XPCould not reproduce in a straightforward test with 3.4.2 rc1 on Windows XP. I set the aurorecovery interval to one minute. I edit a .doc document, adding a bit of text, wait for over one minute, and terminate the soffice.bin process in Task Manager. Then I restart LibreOffice. It offers to recover the document that was being edited, I click "Start Recovery". Next it then offers to send a crash report (huh, I thought we didn't have this functionality, where do these crash reports go?), I click Cancel. The document opens with my unsaved additions intact.Is there something special about the initial reporter's situation? Where do you store the temporary files, what is the path for "Temporary files" in Tools:Options:LibreOffice:Paths ?I think the claim that the problem the initial bug reporter sees would be specific to MSO file types is a red herring. As far as I can understand, autorecovery backup files are in fact saved as the appropriate ODF format. I.e. for text documents, .odt. (The file names used end with .tmp, though.) Autorecovery works also for documents that have been created from scratch without having ever been saved in any format at all, how would that work if autorecovery used the format the document was loaded as, or last saved as?Rainer, I am afraid I am going to ignore your complex comment, it just confuses me... I don't know what backup folder and files you are talking about.(In reply to)Confuses me now, too. Created the comment while testing with all delusions and confusions during the test. I think the result is more or less that recovery documents are available, but LibO does not find them because it expects other names (or similar). If you do not find an other approach (and if you cant' reproduce it will be hard to find ...) I can retry again and may be I find a more direct way.That was simple, it seems the bug has vanished.

Unfortunately I have no idea why this prolbem sometimes does not appear.I believe the most promising approach will be that Tor tries again to reproduce with "autorecovery.doc"?Nothing mysterious with my good test results any longer - I did my tests with fromwith my source.odt documents, not with my test.doc documents :-(@manj_k:Thank you for your endurance.I think it is fairly pointless to attach screenshots or intermediate backup files, recovered files etc in this bug report. I am not really going to look at them. What is needed is exact reproduction instructions that work 100% reliably. Plus possibly then a sample document if it is for some reason impossible to reproduce the problem just using exact minimal reproduction instructions.I am now going to concentrate on the autorecovery.doc from.For the Mac, wouldn't using the kill command from a shell be better than "force quit" from Finder? For all I know, "force quit" might first try to make the process quit in a "clean" fashion, and thus not match a real crash.BTW, why do you people use *two* minutes when testing this? Why not one minute, which would make it a bit less tedious to reproduce the bug? Have you noticed a difference in behaviour between one and two minutes?OK, with the autorecovery.doc from comment I indeed see the stupid "Read-Error. Error reading file" message when the autorecovery is in progress. Could it be the image in the document that causes the recovery problem? Anyway, no need for any more instructions or attachments now, thanks!BTW, when I intalk about the automatically saved backup copies of documents always being in ODF, I was misunderstanding. I think... I was looking at the files in the temp directory's lu*.tmp subdirectory, not the one in LO the user/backup directory.Oh, and to reproduce the problem from scratch, it is enough to insert a picture from a file into an empty text document, and save as .doc. Then open it, add some minimal amount of text, and wait for it to be auto-saved. Then kill soffice.bin, start LO, and watch the recovery fail.Eh, and now I can reproduce it even with no picture inserted into the document, wtf. I thought I had checked that already last week.I have had it on Suse linux, first noticed with LO3.3.2 in a real "hang" situation.I can reproduce it in linux LO3.3.2 and on a mac with 3.4.1 every time with a .doc without a picture.I always start with a .doc created in MSO and sent to me. I have not had a .doc yet that it does not exhibit this problem. The .doc is edited, not saved or saved as and wait for the autorecovery time to elapse before killing or flicking the switch at the wall.My current theory is that the autosave files (the one stored in the user-specific user/backup directory) are always ODF format (and indeed have names that say so, like x4.doc_0.odt for a document loaded from the file x4.doc). They do seem to be well-formed proper ODF documents. But then when ther autorecovery tries to restore the in-progress edit state of the document from the autosave file, it uses the filter for the original document, i.e. it tries to load the above x4.doc autosave file x4.doc_0.odt as if it was a .doc document.Here is a stack trace from SfxBaseModel::load() while attempting the recovery, where in the seqArguments "FilterName" is "MS Word 97" even though "URL" is "file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/N.N/Application%20Data/LibreOffice/3/user/backup/x4.doc_0.odt", and that file indeed is a proper .odt file (and it *does* contain the document as it was when being edited and I intentionally killed the soffice.bin process).sfxmi.dll!SfxBaseModel::recoverFromFile(const rtl::OUString & i_SourceLocation={...}, const rtl::OUString & i_SalvagedFile={...}, const com::sun::star::uno::Sequence<com::sun::star::beans::PropertyValue> & i_MediaDescriptor=0x00e9ee3c {size=8}) Line 1788 + 0x30 bytes C++ fwkmi.dll!framework::AutoRecovery::implts_openOneDoc(const rtl::OUString & sURL={...}, comphelper::MediaDescriptor & lDescriptor={...}, framework::AutoRecovery::TDocumentInfo & rInfo={...}) Line 2663 + 0xb2 bytes C++ fwkmi.dll!framework::AutoRecovery::implts_openDocs(const framework::DispatchParams & aParams={...}) Line 2548 C++ fwkmi.dll!framework::AutoRecovery::implts_doRecovery(const framework::DispatchParams & aParams={...}) Line 3018 + 0xc bytes C++ fwkmi.dll!framework::AutoRecovery::implts_dispatch(const framework::DispatchParams & aParams={...}) Line 637 C++ fwkmi.dll!framework::AutoRecovery::implts_asyncDispatch(void * __formal=0x00000000) Line 1631 C++ fwkmi.dll!framework::AutoRecovery::LinkStubimplts_asyncDispatch(void * pThis=0x06164908, void * pCaller=0x00000000) Line 1620 + 0xf bytes C++ tlmi.dll!01183544() [Frames below may be incorrect and/or missing, no symbols loaded for tlmi.dll] vclmi.dll!vcl::EventPoster::DoEvent_Impl() + 0x12 bytes C++ vclmi.dll!vcl::EventPoster::LinkStubDoEvent_Impl() + 0xe bytes C++ tlmi.dll!01183544() vclmi.dll!ImplHandleClose() + 0x151 bytes C++ vclmi.dll!ImplWindowFrameProc() + 0x2e5 bytes C++ vclmi.dll!SalFrame::CallCallback() + 0x16 bytes C++ vclmi.dll!SalFrameWndProc() + 0x788 bytes C++ vclmi.dll!SalFrameWndProcW() + 0x30 bytes C++ user32.dll!7e368734() user32.dll!7e368816() user32.dll!7e3689cd() user32.dll!7e368a10() vclmi.dll!ImplDispatchMessage() + 0xc bytes C++(In reply to)Yes, that's it!When I 1. copy paste the original document autorecovery.doc to the backup folder after the crash, 2. delete the autorecovery.doc_1.odt in backup folder3. Rename autorecovery.doc by autorecovery.doc_1.odt4. Backup file will be opened during recovery without problemsThat has to be expected from Tor's resultsYeah, the interesting question now is which is the true intentional of the people who have written this code: 1) that documents indeed always are autosaved as ODF, (and the use of the MS Word filter then to recover an autosaved text document is a bug), or 2) that a document is autosaved in the format it is associated with (the one it was loaded from, or saved as, whichever was later, or something) (and that a text document at least in fact is autosaved as .odt is a bug).Heritage from OOo? I did some tests:a) OOo 3.1.1 and 3.4-Dev OOo300m103(Build 9578) both create .odt backup files in the backup folderb) I checked a crash with OOo-Dev3.4, recovery shows the same "Read file error" like LibOWhat ever that might tell concerning "the true intentional of thepeople who have written this code".I did not find a related OOo IssueCould it really be that the use of "foreign" (non-ODF) formats is so rare among the Sun/Oracle developers writing this code that nobody even tried if the autorecovery code in the 3.4 development line works for non-ODF documents?It seems that this small change fixes the problem:Committed to master, one review needed for the 3-4 branch, three reviews needed for the 3-4-2 branch.Fridrich cherry-picked it to the libreoffice-3-4 branch, will thus be in 3.4.3.It seems the bug was introduced Jan 2010:commit 502e0900447f2eab00ead2e2703fe0395ac92baaAuthor: Frank Schoenheit [fs] <>Date: Tue Jan 5 22:32:38 2010 +0100in the big re-write of the recovery code. Good to have it fixed, but certainly not a LibreOffice specific bug.We needed 3.4.2-rc3, so we added this fix there.
id=35188	Standard spreadsheet capability is to be able to reference data cells in external spreadsheets. Behaviour: create a test.ods sheet with some data values. save the file. Create a second new spread sheet. Use any cell in the second spreadsheet and pick a reference a cell that holds a value from the first sheet. E.g. cell A1 in test.ods holds the value '3'. Set cell A1 in the second spread sheet equal to cell test.A1 (ie ='file:///[location]/test.ods'#$Sheet1!A1'). The result should be '3' in the second sheet.The results: The cell result holds '#NAME?'. In the file descriptor, any caps are reduced to small letters. The '$' is dropped. This occurs with 3.3.1.2 OOOm19(Build:8) Ubuntu package 1:3.3.1-1ubuntu3-maverick.The reason for major is that when previously created files are opened that have external links, any cells with references became invalid. Hence, the spread sheets become unusable with this version.I've tried this with a 3.4 snapshot running on Ubuntu marverick and OOO330m19 (Build:6) tag libreoffice-3.3.0.4 running on Fedora 14. Neither exhibit the problem.Also the problem does not occur in 3.3.1.2 OOO330m19(Build:8) tag libreoffice-3.3.1.2 running in Windows 7 Not reproducible.I have similar problem.References to external spreadsheets don't work with 'Index()' command.For example, I have a file 'Calc.ods' on a local drive. The cell A1 holds '=INDEX('file:///Users/kosvlad/Downloads/Price-list.ods'#$Price.A1:D10;1;1)'. So, the 'Price-list.ods' is placed on a local drive too. Its name and its sheet name contain latin characters only without spaces.The A1 of 'Calc.osd' returns 'Err:502'.When I open this file in Open Office 3.2, it works properly, so there is no errors in formulas. Even if external 'ODS' file is placed on a file server and its full name contains cyrillic characters.I tested localised Libre Office (RU) and I have the same problem.Mac OS 10.6.7LibreOffice 3.3.2 OOO330m19 (Build:202)tag libreoffice-3.3.2.2This works in Windows 7.create a test.ods sheet with some data values. save the file.

id=35080	CreatedDocument file that reproduces bug. Right-click "Lani's" to crash.If the string "Lani's" is included in a Writer document with automatic spell checking enabled, it will have the wavy red underline indicating it as a spelling error. If I right-click on that string, Writer will crash. This is 100% reproducible on two different computers. I have attached a sample document that causes this crash.Both computers are running Windows XP Professional SP3 32-bit with LibreOffice v3.3.1. LibreOffice extensions consist of the defaults plus Accentuate v1.0.0, Alternative Searching v1.3.2, DateTime v2.0.3, OxygenOffice Extra Templates US v2.8.0.1, Sun Professional Template Pack II (English) v1.0, and Test Missing Fonts v1.4.4. LibreOffice is configured as "English (Canada)" for both locale setting and default document language.I upgraded from LibreOffice v3.3.0 to v3.3.1 because of this bug, but it is still present.I consider this to be a very serious bug because I have no reason to suspect that there wouldn't be many other magical letter combinations that would also cause data loss due to such crashes.There is a small subset of letter changes that can be made to the "Lani's" string which will also result in a crash, but most do not. Obviously the number of possible replacements are huge, but I have tested the following possibilities, each of which alters only one letter in the string "Lani's":- Replacing the 'L' with 'M' will still crash, but no other uppercase letter will.- No other lowercase replacement for the 'a' will crash.- Replacing the 'm' with 'n' will crash, but no other lowercase letter will.- Replacing the 'i' with any one of "krtuvw" will crash, but no other lowercase letter will.- The apostrophe must remain in order to crash.- The 's' must remain unchanged in order to crash.We are experiencing other crashes with random documents and have as yet noticed no clear pattern. OpenOffice v3.2.1 never crashed under any circumstances for us. LibreOffice is not what we would expect for release quality.

Can anybody see any problem when running the reproduction case under Valgrind on Linux?I don't know if it helps, but I had someone try to reproduce this bug using OpenOffice.org v3.3.0 instead of LibreOffice. He suffered no crash, so it seems to be a LibreOffice bug only.I cannot reproduce this bug with LO 3.3.1 running Windows Vista SP1 x86(In reply to)Actually it's SP2, not that it really matters...(In reply to)I should have also said that he's using Windows 7 rather than Windows XP, so given Zack's test it's also possible that the bug is OS-dependent.I have reproduced it on windows XP 32 bit LibreOffice 3.3.1.2 (Writer,Calc,Impress) without extensionsbut can not reproduce on Mandriva 64 bit LibreOffice 3.3.2.1rc1Createdcrash stack on LibO 3.3.1 sled 11 sp1Hi, I reproduced this on SLED 11 sp1 with LibO 3.3.1. Crash stack attached.Yifan, great, if it van be reproduced on (some) Linux, it can hopefully be valgrinded... Your crash stack (in free()) definitely seems to indicate heap corruption, too.gah, I tried to reproduce this as I have a couple of debug builds around, failed miserably,master (64 bit ) - nolibreoffice3.3 ( 64 bit ) branch with distro patch - no ( although this self build seems to not even detect the spelling error ( might be to do with missing dictionaries or something ) however ( although I did get a very similar valgrind trace to the stack from yifan ) against the generic 3.3.1 build downloaded from libreoffice site. I will attach the valgrind log ( although without line numbers it's not enough for me to see where it is going wrong ).Createdvalgrind log against 3.3.1 finalnote the memcpy error is all I get with the current libreoffice3-3 branch and master builds and that error seems benign ( although in theory it could cause some problems )(In reply to)I should say in this case that I had to set the text language from English (canada ) to English (uk) to get the spelling errorNoel, thanks for the valgrind runs!I also tried reproducing this bug with my desktop which is running Windows 7 SP1 x64. I was unable to reproduce this bug with any combination of letters that have crashed LO for the OP.it is 32-bit specific bugit can reproduced on 32 bit windows and Linuxbut can not reproduced on 64 bit windows and LinuxSasha, I hope you are aware that on 64-bit Linux, the LibreOffice is also 64-bit code, but for Windows, there is only a 32-bit LibreOffice which is used both on 32- and 64-bit Windows. Thus I don't really give that much value to your last comment. You might be making up the wrong conclusions. Please don't bother with technical guesses if you are not a developer and actually have been debugging the code.Thanks for explanations(In reply to)As tor said, I don't think this is correct. I cannot reproduce this bug on either version of Windows (Vista x68 and 7 x64).This bug triggered for me in a Windows XP VM (VirtualBox) with OpenOffice 3.3Bug seems to be fixed in 3.4.

Apple CrashReporter information is attached.Mac OS X 10.6.7 on Intel Core 2 Duo iMac OK, a bit more info - launch application, get splash screen, seems to get through boot process, opens a new window (Start Center) but before anything is drawn in the window, that's when the crash happens.Nothing appears in the Console except a message saying "LibreOffice appears to have crashed (Bus error)" and the CrashReporter info.Deleted LibreOffice.app (3.4) and reinstalled LibreOffice.app (3.3.2) and it works fine again. So definitely something in 3.4 causing the crash.Thorsten, could you take a look at this?I haven't verified this (since I don't have a Mac), but it is consistent with some of the users' feedback who tried one of our Mac nightly builds.(In reply to)Hi Kohei,It is certainly consistent with my experience of the nightly build from 14/04, Julie Nabet also experienced the same thing.The app instantiates, then crashes before it can finish loading the main app window.Alex(In reply to)Sorry, that should've been Julien, T9 my enemy there.AlexSorry again.

id=36982	When loading a docx file, Writer will not load an Equation created in MS Word, and any text after it.This is a regression. This didn't happen in LO 3.3.2. In Writer 3.3.2 the document is fully loaded and the Equation is displayed and opened in MS Equation Editor for editing.Just for the record it didn't happen in OOo Writer 3.3 either. But OOo 3.4 Beta loads the whole text and just ignores the Equation. @:Please attach a sample document!Createddocx sample file with text and equation on the second pageI did add the attachment when I submitted the bug report... Apparently it wasn't uploaded...*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***huh, seems I marked this as a duplicate of the wrong bug ;-(But.. I was able to reproduce this on windows but not on linux ( although my linux build is the latest build of the 3.4 branch ) I need to install the official 3.4 to check if this is really fixed in later builds or just a windows only bugseems this really is windows specific ( which seems weird ) tor, could you have a look pleaseI opened the document in LibreOffice 3.3.2 under Ubuntu 10.04 and the equation does show up. Double clicking the equation opens it in LO Math. But clicking on the equation crashes LO every time.It seems my results confirm Noel's suspect, problem is [Reproducible] with reporter's sample document and "LibreOffice 3.4Beta5 â WIN7 Home Premium (64bit) English UI [DEV300m103 (Build:5)]", equation and following text are not shown.MS WORD Viewer shows equation and following text.Can't test with my own documents, it seems LibO does not export Math objects from Writer to docx (math formula invisible when reopen in LibO and also in MS WORD Viewer, but text behind missing formula object visible).I modified Status to Assigned due to facts.Since this is a regression from 3.3.2 and it prevents loading of documents, shouldn't it be considered a blocker and get higher importance?@:<>!May be you should ask for an answer before you modify the fields? I doubt that this one is a blocker due to the definitions<>, other docx problems mostly are classified with importance "medium / normal", so it will be difficult to substantiate a "blocker":<>Comparing this issue with all other 100000 things on the to do list i can't see more importance for this one than "medium / normal". Please keep in mind that an other "critical" fix would have to be shifted to 3.4.1 in favor of this one, can you decide which one it will be?You are right about the version. Sorry.My point is that this is a REGRESSION and causes DATA LOSS. But you are correct that it only applies to docx. Are all the docx problems the same degree of importance?In 3.4rc1 I get a crash, even, when opening the sample document from.This bug is fixed in MinGW build 93e3a869-b211287-090bcba-45cf606 but not in the MSVC build 130028f-b211287-090bcba-45cf606-05891e7.Does this information help?***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Hint:"Opening of docx-file with mathematical formulas crashed writer.

Hence it was hidden within other bugs.BTW1: The official 32-bit build was done on CentOS.

If I open the file in 3.4 formatting is gone.(In reply to)Nodens, does it happen when you export XLS from LO-3.4? Does it work in L0-3.3. If not, please open a new bug for this. We should keep this bug only for formating lose with LO-3.4 XLS export that did not happen with LO-3.3. We should not pollute it with other import/export bugs.

You should attach it only where it belong, either here or to the new bug.Well this happened in every xls I opened after upgrading to 3.4Anyway, I downgraded to 3.3.2 because of these problems mentioned here.It causes data loss.

Thanks!@Dries Feys:Please attach your result with lost formatting!@Rainer Bielefeld : I don't know what you mean with "Please attach your result with lost formatting!" The attached file has lost formatting with me and some other persons.I admit I wasn't clear which cells supposed to be bold and which not. The given example is the result of an automated batch task which creates the excel-file.I opened & saved the file before uploading it to remove some sensitive data, also with office 2003.So, with "signprev27251243622.xls" (reporters sample 2011-07-01) and "LibreOffice3.4.1 final - WINXP Professional English UI"0. downloaded latest sample1. open "signprev27251243622.xls" with LibO 3.4.1 final: Nothing bold ==> I haven't restarted the pc yet. EXCEL Viewer : dunno Excel 2003 : bold as expected.File was generated with excel 2003, but is apparently saved in excel 97 format.(I'm at home for the moment, so I won't be able to do more tests now - I use 3.3.2 under ubuntu at home and don't have time to install the latest version)What I'll do next monday or tuesday:- after the restart of my computer, verify the current behaviour (if that's ok, the installer should give a message to restart the pc after installing LO)- change my batch task and save the file in a more recent excelformat.But I surely can say I saved the file in excell2003, in excel97format, and that it opens correct in excel, but not in LO 3.4.1 final, which was released earlier today.Am I clear enough now, dear Rainer?Hi Dries,Is this a Windows only issue?I cannot reproduce it on Ubuntu with 3.4.1.(And indeed, the older 3.4.0 does show the problem too on Ubuntu.)I opened all attached test.xls documents, always using applicatino file dialog, with mentioned LibO version, "LibreOffice 3.4.1RC1 - WIN7 Home Premium (64bit) German UI [OOO340m1 (Build:101)]", EXCEL 2010 (Starter version), MS EXCEL VIEWER (12.0.6334.5000). None of my tests showed a formatting loss, EXCEL 2010 also showed the .ods files with correct formatting.This one really is a tough nut.The original report is concerning the problem that .xls documents opened in LibO seem to loose some formatting when they are saved as .xls again from LibO, at least formatting is no longer visible in LibO, but is visible in EXCEL 2003. Information concerning LibO localization, exact OS version missing.If the problem again is reproducible with an old test kit, we still have the old problem, if new test kits will be required to prove, it's a new bug (may be related to this one) that should have a new report.Unfortunately not at all, dear Dries, although some obscurity no longer exists several relevant information still is missing. May I ask you to read hints on <> carefully? Currently it's completely unclear what might cause the different observations, and so every little detail might be the key.I still have problems to understand all details of your problem, so please answer these questions (although some of the details might look irrelevant for you):0.1. You reopened the report because you do not see any bold in "signprev27251243622.xls"?0.2. Yourmeans: C2:D3, N2:N3, U2 SHOULD be bold, but they are not in LibO 3.4.1?0.3. so that Katarina'sconfirms your observations concerning LibO?1. You opened "signprev27251243622.xls": from LibO OS File dialog? LibO LibO File dialog Explorer? Else? From your HDD? Via network?2. 3. Your LibO localization is English (only for the sake of completness)?4. Your "signprev27251243622.xls" nothing bold in LibO means4.1. Cell C2 does not look bold?4.2. Bold icon is not active when cell cursor selects C2?4.3. Bold icon is inactive after double click on cell for every caret position?5. Do you still see a problem with 3.4.1 and old sample documents?5.1. If yes, with what ones?6. Does the problem persist if you rename your user profile before you start LibO (It's just a stab in the dark)?@Cor:Does not seem to be WIN only, My OS and afaik vitriol's are WIN.@KatarinaWhat Excel Version did your use? I already saw bugs only for Viewer or only for particular Excel version or even related to particular settings.I just tried to open and save signprev27251243622.xls with LIbO 3.4.1 final under Win, and I can see the bold formatting.Dries, are you sure that you use 3.4.1 final?Createdscreenshot to clarify the problemIn the uploaded file, mailaddress wasn't visible, but I can assure it IS the same file & behaviourThink you may close this one.The cause is the fact the zoom factor is on 75%, and LibO doesn't show bold anymore when zooming out.Sorry for the inconvenience...Ok, it's clear with bold. But there is something wrong with borders. It seems that 3.4.1 resets cell borders settings.CreatedLO 3.4.1 forgets border settingsCreatedThe same file, using OO 3.2.1@ alexandr: your extra comments for sure is about a diffent issue.

But how do you explain this:"LibreOffice 3.4.1 fixes several bugs that affected the previous version, and can be safely deployed for production needs by most users."this comes from your release announcement...I think most users need a word processor that can print without any issue, so LibO 3.4.1 cannot be safely used by them.please, understand what is the point of my critics... I'm not ranting against you... I know that the LibO 3.4.x development is still work in progress and is still affected by many bugs... I use the 3.3.x series and I'm very happy with it, and I know that sooner or later Lib 3.4.x will be stable.the problem is about newcomers, people who download LibO for the first time...if their first experience with LibO is affected by such a serios bug like the present one, they will not probably give LibO a second chance...my suggestion is to be more prudent with your release bullettins...you cannot tell people that 3.4.1 is almost ready for production needs while it still have such important bugs...I tried - as far as provided - all attachments from the duplicate issues.

I know that in the buggy case, GDIMetaFile::Play( OutputDevice* pOut, sal_uLong nPos ) in vcl/source/gdi is called with a metafile containing just 55 elements, in the non-bug case, 96 elements. But at what stage the table (and its borders, or the lines forming the borders, or whatever) get dropped, no idea."Minimal sample document" seems to show only the table problem, but not the (table related?!) Drawing print problem from my "Lean test document".That is intentional. One kind of bug per bug report.@Tor:It's your decision, I am pretty sure that both effects at least have the same root, the crippling only appears with table in document.(In reply to)In my test document (), the problem "non printing" table border always occurs. - If you select "nothing" (cursor in first position): problem- If you select the image : problem- if the cursor is in the table with nothing selected : problem- if you select the word "first" from the first cell : problem- if you select the whole first cell : problem - if you select the whole table : problemOnly case the border are printed : you select the whole table and , in the print dialog , you choose to print "Selection" (default choice) and not "All pages".Oh and perhaps a new bug ( I've still not searched bugzilla) :- Something (e.g. the table ) is selected.- You choose "Print"- In the print dialog, default choice for "Range and Copies" is printing "Selection"- You choose to print "All pages"- Then choose again to print "Selection"- Crash !Please, for the sanity of developer(s) trying to debug this problem, let them (us) concentrate on just the simplest minimal test document from now on here in this bug report, OK? And no speculation whether some problem with a completely different outcome (a crash) is related, thanks.FWIW, he is some debugging output showing what GDIMetafile "actions" are present in the non-buggy vs. buggy case when printing the sample document from.OK:WinSalPrinter::StartPage()GDIMetaFile::Play (2): nPos=-1 count=96 PUSH MAPMODESetMapMode(new) returning at 826 MAPMODESetMapMode(new) setting maMapMode=rNewMapMode at 864 origin=(-568,-568) scale=(1/1,1/1) at 889 LINECOLOR FILLCOLOR MAPMODESetMapMode(new) returning early, identical mode PUSH LINECOLOR PUSH LINECOLOR RECT POP PUSH LINECOLOR RECT POP PUSH LINECOLOR RECT POP PUSH LINECOLOR RECT POP POP PUSH PUSH ISECTREGIONCLIPREGION POP POP PUSH CLIPREGION TEXTLANGUAGE LINECOLOR COMMENT LINECOLOR FILLCOLOR POLYLINE COMMENT TEXTLANGUAGE LINECOLOR COMMENT LINECOLOR FILLCOLOR POLYLINE COMMENT TEXTLANGUAGE LINECOLOR COMMENT LINECOLOR FILLCOLOR POLYLINE COMMENT TEXTLANGUAGE LINECOLOR COMMENT LINECOLOR FILLCOLOR POLYLINE COMMENT POP LAYOUTMODE LAYOUTMODE FONT TEXTALIGN TEXTFILLCOLOR FONT TEXTALIGN TEXTFILLCOLOR FONT TEXTALIGN TEXTFILLCOLOR PUSH PUSH ISECTREGIONCLIPREGION LAYOUTMODE TEXTLANGUAGE PUSH MAPMODESetMapMode(new) returning early, identical mode PUSH CLIPREGION PUSH ISECTRECTCLIPREGION BMPSCALE POPSetMapMode(new) returning early, identical mode POP POPSetMapMode(new) returning early, identical mode FILLCOLOR LINECOLOR RECT POP POP PUSH ISECTREGIONCLIPREGION POP POPSetMapMode(new) setting maMapMode=rNewMapMode at 864 origin=(0,0) scale=(1/1,1/1) at 889SetMapMode(new) returning early, identical modeWinSalPrinter::EndPage()Not OK:WinSalPrinter::StartPage()GDIMetaFile::Play (2): nPos=-1 count=55 PUSH MAPMODESetMapMode(new) returning at 826 MAPMODESetMapMode(new) setting maMapMode=rNewMapMode at 864 origin=(-568,-568) scale=(1/1,1/1) at 889 LINECOLOR FILLCOLOR MAPMODESetMapMode(new) returning early, identical mode PUSH LINECOLOR PUSH LINECOLOR RECT POP PUSH LINECOLOR RECT POP PUSH LINECOLOR RECT POP PUSH LINECOLOR RECT POP POP PUSH PUSH ISECTREGIONCLIPREGION POP POP LAYOUTMODE PUSH PUSH ISECTREGIONCLIPREGION LAYOUTMODE TEXTLANGUAGE PUSH MAPMODESetMapMode(new) returning early, identical mode PUSH CLIPREGION PUSH ISECTRECTCLIPREGION BMPSCALE POPSetMapMode(new) returning early, identical mode POP POPSetMapMode(new) returning early, identical mode FILLCOLOR LINECOLOR RECT POP POP PUSH ISECTREGIONCLIPREGION POP POPSetMapMode(new) setting maMapMode=rNewMapMode at 864 origin=(0,0) scale=(1/1,1/1) at 889SetMapMode(new) returning early, identical modeWinSalPrinter::EndPage()@Nicolas R:Your Crash observation seems not to be related, I filed new "- PRINTING: Switching radio buttons "Selection <-> All" Crashes"Worked with former LibO versions.Sigh, I now realize that an unknown part of my reproduction successes has actually been bogus: If one has a part of a document "selected", and then File:Print, the idiotic default is that it prints just the selection. I had not noticed that it defaults to printing just the selection. (That is IMHO a horrible feature, but no doubt if we would "fix" it, people would scream how that is an insult to the users, makes LO totally unusable, and especially unsuitable for left-handed people working in the construction industry, or something.)At the moment I am not capable of reproducing the bug with either my own trivial test document (either the one attached, or a similar one constructed from scratch), or the "Copia de..." sample document. This is with a relatively fresh build of vclmi.dll and swmi.dll from the 3-4 branch, but otherwise stock LibreOffice 3.4.0rc2 (I think). I will now try to reproduce with the latest 3.4.2 beta or something...OK, with the 3.4.1 final installed in a VM I can indeed reproduce now again, both with the "Copia de Plantilla"... document (sigh, why can't we have sample documents with *short* and *simple* names?) and with a minimal test case constructed on the fly out of a 1x1 table with an image. (And this time I made sure that I did *not* print just the selection.)Will now then try to replace the vclmi.dll and/or swmi.dll DLLs with the ones freshly built for debugging and see if the bug goes away...CreatedAnother minimal test caseNow, with this test case, I definitely see the bug even if I make sure not to have anything selected. Both with 3.4.1 final as such, and with a freshly built vclmi.dll.And here is the same kind of debugging output from printing that t.odt, with the table (its borders) not visible in the output:WinSalPrinter::StartPage()GDIMetaFile::Play (2): nPos=-1 count=96 PUSH MAPMODESetMapMode(new) returning at 826 MAPMODESetMapMode(new) setting maMapMode=rNewMapMode at 864 origin=(-3265,-568) scale=(1/1,1/1) at 889 LINECOLOR FILLCOLOR MAPMODESetMapMode(new) returning early, identical mode PUSH LINECOLOR PUSH LINECOLOR RECT POP PUSH LINECOLOR RECT POP PUSH LINECOLOR RECT POP PUSH LINECOLOR RECT POP POP PUSH PUSH ISECTREGIONCLIPREGION POP POP PUSH CLIPREGION TEXTLANGUAGE LINECOLOR COMMENT LINECOLOR FILLCOLOR POLYLINE COMMENT TEXTLANGUAGE LINECOLOR COMMENT LINECOLOR FILLCOLOR POLYLINE COMMENT TEXTLANGUAGE LINECOLOR COMMENT LINECOLOR FILLCOLOR POLYLINE COMMENT TEXTLANGUAGE LINECOLOR COMMENT LINECOLOR FILLCOLOR POLYLINE COMMENT POP LAYOUTMODE FONT TEXTALIGN TEXTFILLCOLOR FONT TEXTALIGN TEXTFILLCOLOR FONT TEXTALIGN TEXTFILLCOLOR LAYOUTMODE PUSH PUSH ISECTREGIONCLIPREGION LAYOUTMODE TEXTLANGUAGE PUSH MAPMODESetMapMode(new) returning early, identical mode PUSH CLIPREGION PUSH ISECTRECTCLIPREGION BMPSCALE POPSetMapMode(new) returning early, identical mode POP POPSetMapMode(new) returning early, identical mode FILLCOLOR LINECOLOR RECT POP POP PUSH ISECTREGIONCLIPREGION POP POPSetMapMode(new) setting maMapMode=rNewMapMode at 864 origin=(0,0) scale=(1/1,1/1) at 889SetMapMode(new) returning early, identical modeWinSalPrinter::EndPage()@Torthanks for your efforts trying to fix this annoying bug.I keep my fingers crossed!!!However, with a freshly built swmi.dll I don't see the bug. Whether this is because I built it with (partial) debugging, or because of some code changes in it since 3.4.1, no idea...I guess it is possible that we are lucky, and some change in the code after 3.4.1 has (accidentally) fixed also this problem...@Tor:What ever that might help for your investigations: I just did a test with my more complex sample documens and compared result 3.4.1 and a Daily 3.4 Branch Dated 2011-07-08. I see much progress concerning the table printing, a blue table not printed at all with 3.4.1 now is printed correctly, and also the resting table lines seem to be complete. A print with HP OJ3110 looks perfect, also the Drawing object is no longer cropped.It might be that there still some PS print problems exist. FREEPDF shows some line thickness issues (grey instead of black), and the envelope still is cropped, but in a different way I saw that before. IMHO this is a different issue that had been hidden by the terrible other croppingResult via Dell PS Printer still looks horrible on screen, some better in print, but same as from OOo 3.1.1, so that is not our problem.My summary:Table print problem fixed / worksforme (IMHO we can change status)Remaining Drawing Cropping problem IMHO different issue, If you do not object, I will file a new report for that.@Tor & Reinergreat!!! teamwork pays!!!I can confirm Rainer's finding.Tested with LibO 3.4 Daily[libreoffice-3-4~2011-07-10_23.10.17_LibO_3.4.1rc1_Win_x86_install_en-US_de_fr.exeon WinXP]:1.

Thanks a lot all.(I missed this earlier, because I'm on vacation and missed too that my subscription to libreoffice-dev list somehowe got broken).As state/solution I would rather advice just 'fixed'. Not only because it was broken (though the reason solution are not spit out), but also beacuse it is much clearer to people looking for the coming 3.4.2 release that this is fixed. Now 37488 does not show on...fixed ! Cheers !@Cor Nouws:I prefer the "WORKSFORME" because we can not know how t4h problem has been repaired. For good reasons the Bugzilla Help text for FIXED is "A fix for this bug is checked into the tree and tested." These fixes are very reliable. The pseudo-fixes are much less reliable, sometimes the problem reappears. For me it eases the work if my Bugzilla search separates such "real reviewed fixes" from "problem vanished somehow, nobody knows why".@rainer:well, OK, I can agree. I thought setting to 'Fixed' would help to get this kind of automagically resolved issues in the generated list of fixes.

The possibility to print notes besides text, like in MS Office would be really a big step forward. This feature is missing since the early OOo release. Due this lack I still need MS Office for printing documents with notes, because it is not possible to work with notes printed on the next/last page.Orwel - it is quite a well known issue that people are trying to find funding to fix; whether it is a 'most annoying' bug, as a non-blocker, non-regression I don't know. Then again we have no tracker for "most important features". Either way, you'd want to file a bug for this I think.

I know this is an old bug report from LibreOffice 3.4, but IMHO fixing it for 3.5 is even more important now because our "scratch-pad of notes to build release notes from" atsays:"Support for export and import of math formulas in Office Open XML (docx) documents (LuboÅ¡ LuÅÃ¡k)."So, if we declare that there is now official support for import/export of math formulas in docx documents, it is strange that opening such a docx document containing some math formulas does not work at all or even crashes LibreOffice ...Just ignore my proposal if I got something wrong, but at least to me fixing this bug seems especially important.

So, when people "nominate" a bug for the coveted Most Annoying membership, does that mean they 1) suggest it as a candidate for being Most Annoying, i.e. invite discussion whether it is or not? Or that they 2) directly entitle it, say that it *is* a Most Annoying bug?@Tor:Because of that confusion I changed my wording to "Adding bug ...". I do not believe we should do long discussions here concerning each bug, IMHO the proceeding should be: - Always add the Bug Number to "Depends on"- Always cite the Bug Subject in a comment with a one sentence reason why it is a "Most Annoying" one, so that we keep overview here.Without objection the Bug remains listed here, or someone objects and deletes it from "Depends on", further discussion in the Bug report itself.A "nominate first, discuss, add" would be too bureaucraticI understand it the way that all bugs are kind of nominated because they could be added and removed from the dependencies at any time if there are good reasons.I think that the main confusion is whether to update bug dependencies together with the explanation comment or wait for someone to accept it.My suggestion is to update dependencies immediately if you are pretty sure that it is annoying for many users. You could just leave a comment if you are not sure.It is how it works now and I think that it works well.I agree with Rainer that we do not want long discussions about every bug. Most people nominate reasonable bugs. This is why the initial comment suggest to add the dependency immediately.By other words, both approaches are good.

The extension is available for LibreOffice,OpenOffice and Microsoft Office and is important for German professionalwriters as well as many 'regular' German writers.Not being able to install the extension in LibO 3.4.0 to 3.4.4 makes for a/very/ bad user experience. Guess what users relying on that extension willstay with or switch to?As far as I can see from the discussion in #37561, a fix (adding missingsymbols) should be relatively simple.Thanks,Stephan HennigNote, I've also added this bug to 'LibreOffice 3.4 most annoying bugs', but only after LibO 3.4.5 was released.

A long-standing bug, of course, but IMHO very important, because this kind of silent, not easy to notice, but severe footnote data loss is exactly the kind of problem that could make LibreOffice useless for scientific, Academic and other purposes and could chase out many users if it became public ...(How can I say to my students: "Just use LibreOffice instead of MS Office, it's free and fast, you can save you document as DOC file later, if you ever need to do so", when there is the possibility that some footnotes get lost on DOC export? Then, if I say to a student: "This is a citation but you did not mark it! You made a plagiarism!" the student could just answer: "Oh no, there was footnote giving the complete reference, but LibreOffice must have killed the footnote when I saved the document as DOC file." Even the former German Minister of Defense, Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg, who had to withdraw because he missed so many many many quotation marks and references in his PhD thesis, could excuse himself by saying "I used OpenOffice, and it has killed all the footnotes." ;-)Great nomination Roman - thanks for that ! :-)please, consider this bug :this bug is also in libreofficeand is a very annoying bug...(In reply to)@choffardet:Here we only can list LibO Bugzilla bugs.

Unimportant bugs they will ignore for now.@dEI think you should ask advise to the QA team (Reiner & co.) before removing MABs.removing those existing bugs from this page does not solves them.1) let not flame here2) deleting something from "Depend on" not very important because:a) bug numbers still seen inside of commentsb) most of them are closed because "Duplicate" c) bugreport owners often communicate directly to developers, not via MABIMHO, dE did great job. We could discuss particular bugs but some clean up was useful.For example. I am not sure about removing the. IMHO, the password protected documents are used by some type of users and it is rather important feature. Other than that, I agree that the removed bugs were not that important and did not belong here.Bugs mentioned here are proceed in two ways:First, comments are send to the mailing list. So, if you mention a bug, it is read by many developers and it might get immediate attention. In this case, it does not matter if you update the dependency or not.Second, it is used for prioritization. Developers can't fix everything immediately. They look here when they finish something and look for another job. In this case, they do not read comments but they check list of opened bugs. So, the dependency, priority, and severity is important.So, we need to keep dependencies, priorities, and severities in a good state. Otherwise, we will end with another swamp where it will be hard to find the important bugs. IMHO, we need not spend too much time on it at this stage because the number of opened bugs is still reasonable low and developers could filter them easily. On the other hand, any clean up is good and we might even need it in the future.Add "- FILEOPEN arbitrary.pptx will CRASH", seems we (at least with WIN) lost ability to open that document type (created with MSO)Hi dE(In reply to)Prolly this is not the best place to discuss. but ...Would be my guess too.

Indeed AnnoyingAh well, a Wordprocessor with broken cross-references.. OK, it's Non-standard caption number, but why would that have be added in the first place?If a feature is used more or less, is not the sole scale to measure the annoyancy, IMO ;-)(In reply to)I think that indeed is the best idea. We have the QA list, and even can ask advise from users and discuss list if we think we got stuck ;-)Anyway, thanks for your thoughts and contribution dE.CorAdding again. I ask dE not to remove other people's bugs and not to discuss them here.(In reply to)The title clearly says "LibreOffice 3.5 most annoying bugs"... yours is not even a bug.You simply can't add your personal bugs or feature enhancements here... you gotta think about others also. And this way, the whole bugzilla will be added to the list.We're only interested in bugs which cause data loss, corruption, crashes, and other i/o errors (especially with MS office formats).I think it's time Rainer Bielefeld steps in and advice us what to do.(In reply to)I think that it is questionable. If it replaces 1345-1430 with 13.45-14..0, it is data loss. If you replace data in large documents and you do not notice, it might be very annoying.Please stop fighting about this bug. We are not in a state where we need to spend time on such long discussions. Developers are clever. They could filter few bugs that does not belong here. After all, this is just a helper bug. It does not enforce any work. It is just a suggestion.It is not Cor's pet bug. Cor have actively worked on bug triagging for a long time. He has great overview about type of bugs that people report. So, his opinion has some value. Note that nothing is black and white. There might be different views on some things.First, I thank you all for spotting and fixing all those bugs, and especially for opening bug like this one. What's clear here is that's about bugs, and not enhancements. I'd like to discuss 2 issues, I apologize if it's already been done. 1. "Most annoying bugs" is relative, we don't have all the same opinion about what's most annoying. If it's like this, where is the limit, or this should mean "all bugs"? I'm not aware of some bug that is little annoying and thus not here. My opinion is that all bugs should be tracked, although some minor and hard may not be fixed.2. "LibreOffice 3.5" has releases. Although in bug itself it can be seen in which release it will be/was fixed, it'd be convenient to see it also here. For example, to see "fixed in 3.5.1", "fixed in 3.5.2", etc below "Depends on". If it's a feature of Bugzilla, there should be some aggregating meta issue there, with that option, for bugs like this one.IMHO, it currently works the following way:If you add a bug here, you send a message to developers. Hey, this is something that people really hates in this release. It annoys many people and discourage them from using this application. This is something that you should solve ASAP.Developers look at the bugs and fix them if possible.Note that developers are in CC in many other bugs, read mails, have other tasks from other people, have their personal life. They maintain their own priority lists. So, this bug does not enforce anything. It is still only a helper tool. Though, it seems that it works pretty well.My view of why we need this bug:First, any software has bugs and we can't fix everything. Any fix could potentially create another bug. Also we could not make everyone happy. Some people might like a feature that annoys other people. We can't make everything configurable because it would be hard to maintain all options. Even if we make it configurable, people will fight about defaults. So, we will always have any bug reports.Next, this bug won't be needed if people set severity and priority correctly. Unfortunately, it does not work in a real life. If a person gets into a state that she reports a bug, she is often quite annoyed and wants a solution quickly. The bug is often quite important for the person, so she tends to set high severity and priority. One the other hand, some people does not know about this setting and they use the default values. All this can be corrected by people doing the bug triage who see many bugs every day and could better prioritize them. Unfortunately, we do not have enough people this time, so many bugs still have the severity and priority set by the reporter. So the query for all bugs does not show the most annoying bugs on top.Finally, this bug is a workaround for the above problem. It is mostly updated by people doing the regular bug triage. They know the bigger picture and do their best guess what belongs here. They try to do not include their pet bugs. Of course, everyone has its own opinion. Also this bug is opened for anyone. Well, I think that it has worked quite well so far and we do not need any complex rules. IMHO, the name "most annoying bugs" set the right feeling in most people ;-)If we want to keep it working, we need to keep a balance.If we mention too many bugs here, we will create another swamp of ideas and developers will ignore it. I am not sure where are the limits. IMHO, it somehow works now, so we do not need any regulation at this stage.In each case, fights about each bug are rather contra-productive. It is better to fix them than discuss their priorities ;-)@ TimurWe can see bug title when place mouse cursor over bug numbers in field "Depends on". Expected version, where bug will not exist may be added to end of titles of mentioned bugs. But it is much to work.Hi Timar,(In reply to)Yes, so the one acting with code (fixing a bug) decides.All are tracked. In bugzilla.In addition to what others said: the release notes give a list of fixed bugs.Should I add more bugs (I can easily add a 100 more).Yes, but preferred that only one bug per day. We should have time to think on one bug before appears another(In reply to)Yes and no. Bugs that belong here, pls do. However: I do not believe in doing it 'easily'. Since, steps in the correct work flow are: - reproduce, - test impact, workarounds, - query BugZilla for related and the same or closely related issues which may lead to do some bundling of issues - in case of doubt, consult others via the QA list....But any bug that is really a problem, and that is not yet visible here: pls do. We have had issues in the past, that were in BugZilla for months, turned out to be very nasty, and were not recognised fast enough, but discovered just because I (or someone else) was confronted with a similar problem and did "the work" in BugZilla.So finding those bugs, is important and more helpful than adding just a load of bug numbers to this MAB.Thanks for your help!@dE, Sasha, Cor:For discussions we have <>, please stop discussion here immediately! Same concerning discussion concerning relevance of bugs, discuss that in the bugs, not here. Tis Bug is only to be used for purposes as per Petr's report.

We can't terminate 3.5 before this has been fixed.: embedded hsqldb too slow (regression)I have resisted for a long time, but finally I have to nominate- "Many crashes when accessibility enabled on Mac".I have resisted for a long time, because this is not an easy candidate:* the problem is limited to a single platform (MacOS X);* it is not always reproducible out of the box;* it is not clear where the problem comes from, i.e. if the bug is in our code or in Apple's code.But nevertheless, it is definitely a "most annoying bug", and so I *have* to nominate it:* it affects quite more users than you may think (see the duplicates listed in; and there are even more similar bug reports which are just not marked as duplicates of!)* it causes crashes about crashes for the users which suffer from it;* these crashes appear in many different actions, giving our users the (wrong) impression that every piece of LibreOffice was unstable;* therefore this bug has the potential to drive users crazy;* and to make them leave LibreOffice once and for good.You may object: "We have an easy workaround: just disable the MacOS accessibility features, and LibreOffice is stable again"; this is true, but IMHO it does not make this bug less annoying:* It is very difficult for "normal" users to discover any connection between the crashes in LibreOffice and the MacOS accessibility features,* therefore "normal" users will not discover the workaround easily;* we, the QA volunteers, have to ask people again and again to check their accessibility settings, which shows that people even forget about these settings (and therefore will not use the workaround, even if we list it in the release notes and read_me files);* for many people which are physically disabled/handicapped in one or the other way the accessibility features are vitally necessary, so they just CAN NOT disable them* and have to leave LibreOffice instead;* therefore this workaround is NOT a workaround for them.In addition, it gives me a rather bad feeling about LibreOffice that we unwillingly discriminate people (physically disabled/handicapped people) which are already discriminated by our way of live in many ways. This is a bad thing to do for free and open software -- it should be free and open also in the meaning of being easily accessible and usable for as many people as possible.Therefore, we need to track down this issue some day. Even if we can't fix it because the problem is in Apple's code (I don't believe this, because many other applications seem to work fine with accessibility features enabled, including other office applications!), we need to find out about this, either in order to fix it (together with Apple) or at least to explain to our users that the crashes are not our fault.Sorry for this rant -- no offence! -- I just wanted to state clearly why this bug, even being limited to a single platform and not easy to track down, is nevertheless an important (!) candidate for our "most annoying bugs" list. So please don't remove it from this list, but let's think together about what we can to do to solve this issue.Hi Roman,Please don't resist so long - it's good to make these visible, even if they are ill-formed and hard to fix; the video in that bug is amazing :-) clearly we need to address this. It is possible of course that the bug is in OS/X - but if so we need to work out which versions of it - and then blacklist a11y only for those versions (if there is a consistent pattern there it'd be good to build data for that).Thanks for raising it :-)add linked slide editing / potential data-loss ergonomic issue from 3.6 tracker - that is not specific to 3.6Nominate- Impossible to use Writer OLE object in drawing or presentation due to uncontrollable size and position.This is regression bug and it makes completely impossible to use releases after 3.3.4 if you need to have Writer OLE objects in your documents.Add "- CRASH on any action for particular big .odt". 7000 pages document is nothing affecting many users, but we had it working in 3.4, and who can know whether we also have an increased vulnerability with some hundreds pages documents?Add "- FILESAVE: # in hyperlink corrupts .docx (MSO2007) document": Dataloss Regression.Add win32 specific crash loading Danish dictionary during startup after upgrade- sounds bad.nominate: memory leak, crash under XP.- "FORMATTING Fit to Frame for text boxes is broken" should be removed from "LibreOffice 3.6 most annoying bugs" () and added here, because this bug goes back to LibreOffice 3.3.0.Add- FILESAVE [DOCX] File.docx, created LibO Writer, can't be opened in other programs ()Add- FILESAVE [DOCX] Loss of footnotes's text when exporting to DOCX-files ()Add "- CRASH when browse to HD root directory in FILEOPEN Template dialog": Crash, Regression, several DUPsI deleted(DUPLICATE of), added(FIXED), deleted(DUPLICATE of), added(NEW).Add "- SVG Export ignores line width", currently SVG export is completely unusable.Nominate(DOCX filter loses shape containing text) and(Error reading âContent (TOC)â from a DOCX).These bugs are not regression but they make unusable re-import OOXML textdocuments (DOCX, ISO) by Writer.

For this special case (bullet lists still wrong on Mac OS X), the specialwas filed.

id=38542	Created180% screenshot of table rules in 3.3.2I have a document with hundreds of tables. I designed the table rules with the corporate style. I've attached a screenshot of one of the tables, before and after 3.3.4.When I loaded the file into LibreOffice 3.3.4, the table rules exploded, as shown in the second attachment. (Both attachments are taken with the document at 180%.)Here's how the upper-left corner cell is defined in the odt/content.xml file:style:border-line-width-left="0.0139in 0.0139in 0.0139in" style:border-line-width-top="0.0139in 0.0139in 0.0139in" fo:padding="0.0201in" fo:border-left="0.0417in double #0000ff" fo:border-right="none" fo:border-top="0.0417in double #0000ff" fo:border-bottom="0.0007in solid #0000ff"Here's how is looks in 3.3.4:style:border-line-width-left="0.0417in 0.0417in 0.0417in" style:border-line-width-top="0.0417in 0.0417in 0.0417in" fo:padding="0.0201in" fo:border-left="3pt double #0000ff" fo:border-right="none" fo:border-top="3pt double #0000ff" fo:border-bottom="0.05pt solid #0000ff"As you can see, the border-line-width-left and top are getting tripled!(B.T.W. 0.0139in = 1pt; 0.0417in = 3pt) Created180% screenshot of table rules in 3.3.4Yo, anyone home?Createdtable with 3pt double rules that don't display properly in 3.4More on this one. LibreOffice 3.3.3 and 3.4 display the same table rules radically differently for the same file (attached). 3.3.3 draws the lines correctly. 3.4 draws the lines way too fat, which obscures part of the content.Still a problem in 3.4.2rc1P.S. The tables were created in OpenOffice, not Microsoft, so it's a problem with changing OO versions, not conversion from Microsoft.[Reproducible] with "LibreOffice 3.4.1 - WIN7 Home Premium (64bit) German UI [OOO340m1 (Build:103)]". In master situation becomes even worse!Situation is a little confusing because there seem to be also bugs in older versions ( see "- TABLES border formatting preserved").But facts are:a) Double borders are shown different in LibO 3.3.3 (OOo) ans LibO 3.4aa) white space between lines and inner lines will be shown too thickb) Saving with LibO 3.4 and Reopening with LibO 3.3.3 does not heal problems from 3.4, Tables will be destroyed, look even worse than looked with 3.4 (with thin single border) and can no longer be used in 3.3.3 without intensive rework.For more details please see screenshots from my Testkit.This problem makes 3.4 unusable for all users using tables with double lines.

It is relatively common thing. So I increase the priority.Cedric has vacation next few weeks. Lubos, any chance that you could look at it?.Is this related to- Abnormal Table Rendering ?No,has to do with rendering tables whose borders were generated in xml, something about incompatible parameters.This bug has to do with tables created in OpenOffice prior to 3.4 being rendered improperly in 3.4.Has anyone signed on to this bug?(In reply to)Abnormal table rendering you can also see in new documents created with LO 3.4.3.Glad that someone filed this bug before. This bug makes older files nearly unusable.Createddoc viewed in LO ver 3.3Createddoc viewed in LO ver 3.4 & greaterCreateddocument containing table with single line bordersIt's not just double borders that are affected. I have many documents containing tables with single minimal width (0.05pt) borders that no longer render correctly. A stripped down example is attached. In OOo 3.3.0 and LO 3.3.2 this renders correctly, with borders around all cells (see first screenshot). In LO 3.4.x and LO 3.5.0, most of the borders are missing (see second screenshot).For me, this makes LO completely unusable.Createddocument viewed in OOo 3.3.0Createddocument viewed in LO 3.5.0 beta(In reply to)Another issue, viewing hidden cell borders has changed also.Using Lo 3.5 RC1 and the LO 3.4.x series.These two features seem to control the visibility of cell borders, the behavior has been changed.1. menu > view > text boundaries2. menu > table > table boundariesAFAIKT, 'table boundaries' is not working (does not show or hide cell boundaries) on my docs.Seems like someone has been busy changing table features, without an eye towards backward compatibility.Createdput "double" cell borders on a dietin the first attachment, the cell borders are of type "double",and the ODF import filter effectively triples their width.patch should fix that.Createdprevents wrong overriding of the style:border-line-width attributesanother problem when importing the first attachment:the width from fo:border overrides widths in style:border-line-width,which are more specific for "double" style borders and thusshould be preferred.additional note about the second patch:i'd really like to detect the fact that we have read the otherattribute by adding some booleans in the import filterinstead of checking that the width is not zero, but that seemsto require too much refactoring to do it now... so thisheuristic will have to do.now, the document inside the zip file attached inlooks much better, which is mostly good but in one case not:the 6.55 pt double border has attributes like this: style:border-line-width="0.002cm 0.088cm 0.141cm" but it is displayed with 3 equal width inside, gap, outside lines.looking at it in OOo 3.3 it is rather ugly, but stillthe fact that it looks prettier in LO 3.4 is a regression :)Createdadd a custom double border stylethis patch seems to fix the problem described in previous comment.i'm really not sure if this is the right approach, apparentlyeverything that doesn't match one of the pre-defined stylesis deliberately ignored; is there a reason for that?anyway, saving the document again, i get the same attribute values,and the rendering looks rather more like in older versions,except not the same: the thin inner lines are painted too long,also outside the table cell borders.Michael,thanks for the patches. they are OK for me.

id=39484	Several times, while editing one of several spreadsheets, I have found the outline groups which I had recently created, to have disappeared. I believe this sometimes happened while the file was open; more often, I have noticed the outlines' absence only after re-opening a file which I had previously edited. Sometimes the outlining disappear from multiple sheets, sometimes just from one.When I discover the outline groups to be gone, the rows (or columns) which had been collapsed, are now hidden. I can reveal them by selecting a range including those rows or columns, right-clicking, and choosing Show. But there seems to be no way to recover the outlining I had created, other than to re-create it from scratch.Is there anyone else who has noticed, or is able to replicate, this behavior? Because it happens inconsistently, I'm not yet sure how to reliably reproduce it, and the files which it affects are full of personal information, so I'm reluctant to share them. If necessary, I suppose I could try to craft a simple file where the behavior might be replicated. (Any tips are welcome.) I think it would be best if you give a case (even if it isn't consistently reproducible) in which the bug occurs. That way there are some attributes that people can examine which might be the cause for the failure to record the change.There was a case reported inin which calc does not save changes in cell's widths and other attributes because the spreadsheet was imported as a .doc file. Perhaps that might be the cause of the bug?Anyway, keep digging,but any sample document or reproducible behavior would be great help.(In reply to)Thanks for the reply. In fact, I believe all of the documents in question originated as PlanMaker files which I saved as Excel and then opened in LibreOffice. When I was editing them in PlanMaker, besides other bugs (which eventually led me to switch to LibreOffice), sometimes the outlines were lost or corrupted (certain levels or elements of them were lost). I thought it was strange that LibreOffice, a completely different program, would have a similar bug, where outlines could be corrupted or lost. Perhaps, as you suggest, it's the files themselves which are corrupted, and LibreOffice only wasn't able to detect or fix the corruption when importing them.I'll experiment with this and post more.CreatedFirstSee post for detailsCreatedSecondSee post for detailsCreatedThirdSee post for detailsSince my last post, I tried copying all the sheets of one of the spreadsheets in question to a new file (both ODS), to see if the outlines would still be occasionally lost. Today I opened that file to find, indeed, all the outlining gone.Jeffrey, if you have a hint for how to copy the data to a new file without bringing along whatever corruption might be causing the outlines to disappear, please let me know.For now, I post three files, which I've just created, in case anyone can examine them and see what differences might lead one or more of them to lose its outlines. I haven't yet observed that behavior with any of these files, but if I do, I'll post again.All files are ODS. The first file I simply created from scratch in LibreOffice. I named it "Outlining bug test (created in LibreOffice).ods".The second file I created in PlanMaker 2010 (by copying & pasting the range of text cells from LibreOffice, then duplicating the outlining by hand in PlanMaker), and saved in PMD (PlanMaker's native format), then saved again in XLS, then opened the XLS in LibreOffice and saved it as ODS. I named it "Outlining bug test (created in PlanMaker 2010 as xls).ods".For the third file, I used LibreOffice to open the original PMD I had created in PlanMaker, and then saved it as ODS. I named this file "Outlining bug test (created in PlanMaker 2010 as pmd).ods".For the second and third files, I adjusted some of the column widths, as they didn't all convert accurately. For all three files, I collapsed the outlines to level two before saving (i.e. levels one and two are visible, level three is collapsed).All three files, therefore, should have these rows, where parentheses indicate rows which are collapsed, and brackets indicate rows which are simply hidden (and aren't part of the outline):1-2-3-45-6-7 (--8)-9-1011 [12 13 14]15-16 (--17)18-19 (--20 --21)-22-23And these columns:A-B-C-D (--E)-FIn my experience, when the outlines disappear, those rows/columns which had been collapsed, the last time they were viewed, are now simply hidden, and there's no evidence of outlining.I hope these files are helpful.CreatedThird (corrected)See post for details[This is an automated message.]This bug was filed before the changes to Bugzilla on 2011-10-16.

Currently we are checking all ods files changed since out update to 3.6.4.3, so we might find more.As data gets lost, I have upgraded the severity of this bug(In reply to)We have finished out investigations:of the thousand+ of ods-files that have been converted from xls to ods, two files have suffered loss of all groups and all notes on one or more tabs (not on all tabs). One file had this phenomenom more than once, i.e. at one date the groups and notes of one tab were lost, at another date the groups and note of another tab were lost.We have only checked files that have been modified in the last 2 months.One of the files lost its groups and notes on one tab before the upgrade from version 3.5 to 3.6.4.3, the other incidents happened with version 3.6.4.3. We have not been able to establish whether all incidents originated from one user/one installation.We cannot reproduce the problem. Should we be able to reproduce the problem or similar behaviour, I will update this bug inmediately.(In reply to)I have this problem with EVERY ods file I use. I've tried to narrow down what could the fault be, but I get lost in the possibilities.I feel lost, as a I am engaged to free software and it seems impossible to work without manual grouping and outlining. I tried these with no successI am currently working on a 10MB,260 sheet ods file. The problem is exactly as explained above. The ods file does not come from xls conversion. It sometimes happen on one sheet, sometimes on all sheets. The result is devastating on a 260 sheet file. I've always managed to workaround the various bugs from various releases, but this one is the most critical. I am worrying what I am going to do, if I don't find a workaround in the near future. I currently use kubuntu 12.04 , had the same problem with 11.04, I am considering of trying libreoffice4 at some point or another distro. I am also trying to find out how to report the bug since it is the firt time I report or comment a bug.In the meanwhile I would appreciate any directions on how to deal with it. Going to ms excel is no option, I intend to deal with it.Createdcalc document that suffers grouping/notice lossAttached document has suffered loss of grouping and notes in entire tabsheet(s) more than once, all with version 3.6.4.3 on Windows 7.Tab "Bediendeel P4238_4241" was most often the victim of the bug.Document has been saved as fods to remove client's name and then resaved as ods.This document was originally created in MS Office 2000 and in 2011 opened in LibreOffice, saved as ods and kept as ods.When investigating the damaged file (saved as fods to investigate), Grouping and notes where simply not there at all. If need be, I could upload such a damaged file too (after removing the client's name).First, thanks a lot for moving this bug forward. Unfortunately, I am not able to reproduce the problem.I tried the following with both LO-3.6.5.2, and 4.0.1.1: 1. Opened fdo39484-sample.ods from the2. Saved as fodt and reloaded 3. Saved as ods and reloadedResult: The grouping was still there.The above test was inspired by the description:--- cut ---Document has been saved as fods to remove client's name and then resaved as ods.This document was originally created in MS Office 2000 and in 2011 opened in LibreOffice, saved as ods and kept as ods.--- cut ---So, I do not know how reproduce this and how to debug this. It even looks that the document could get corrupted when removing client's name in the fods form.Could you please, provide clear steps how to reproduce this? It would help if you start with a good document, do some steps and end with broken document. The following style helps to provide good description:1. Open document X in application Y2. Do this3. Do that4. ...Result:Expected Result:I am sorry but this bug can't be blocker in this state. It is a data loss but theindicates that it affects only very limited set of documents. It seems to be pretty old but I do not see any duplicates or many people in CC which means that it probably affects only very limited group of people => reducing severity a bit.It even does not belong into MABs in this state because nobody is able to start debugging it right now. I will leave it there because it is a data loss and I guess that you will provide the scenario within next few hours or days. I feel that we are very close :-)(In reply to)No, to my frustration I cannot. We have so far not been able to reproduce the data loss on purpose. We know that one document () seems to be more susceptible, but losing the grouping (which is very annoying) and losing the notes (which is more than annoying) seems to happen unexpectedly.Koukasio () also reports seemingly random, unexpected and not (yet) reproducible happening of the bugWhat I can say is that we did not have any of this with version 3.5 and earlier.Because of problems with openening Access files, we only updated to 3.6 when 3.6.4 came out.When I get a report from someone regaridng this grouping/notes-loss, I try to look at the damaged file, but it seems as if the grouping and notes are simply not saved for that tab sheet.As our problems look like the orignal reported bug, I reopened it, but my (and koukasio's) problems may be different from the one reported in 2011. I don't know.Changing the severity and reporting it as MAB was triggered by the loss of data, it not happening only once or with only one user and the confirmation of koukasio of the bug.I'm willing to help wherever I can. On the coding part, I have no experience with the file saving aspects of calc, but I could add traces to the code - if only we know how to reproduce th bug ...I have tried to reproduce the bug, but I can't. I have even made notes with the possibilities, but I get lost in them. My basic problem of reproducing the bug is that it happens in an unfocused sheet and there seems to be a random aspect. The closest I've come to it, was when once the +- buttons on horizontal grouping were visible but not responding to clicks or shortcuts for hide/show. After switching sheet and back again , buttons were gone and grouping was lost.I have some examples, because I save instances of the document often, but it is a 260 sheet 10mb document and it is difficult to track changes...I understand your pain. Please, try to understand the other side as well. If it is hard to reproduce, it is also hard to fix. The LO source code is really huge and the bug might be in many locations. Some complicated bugs takes days to fix even when they are easily reproducible. This one is harder because there is no scenario.The bug has been reported 1.5 year ago. I understand that it is data loss and more people are affected. But still there are only 4 people in CC and no duplicate. I do not understand why it should suddenly start blocking bug fix release with other useful fixes and improvements.Please note that changing severity from blocker to critical is not that big change. It only means that this bug will not block the release. It has the highest priority, the second highest severity, so it is still on top of the queries. It is listed in MABs, so heavily advertised. I have also nominated it as "Hard Hack", so it might get even more attention soon, seePlease continue in monitoring this problem when you work with LO and when you read other bugs or mails. It is kind of detective work. You might meat a new indicia that could help to create a scenario and help to fix it.I guess that there is an operation that breaks a data structure in memory and the information about the outline groups gets lost. It might help to remember what operations you did when this bug happened and compare them with operations that you do the other days and you do not see this bug.(In reply to)Thanks for your assistance and cooperation..! I understand. I've always managed to work around the bugs, and keep on doing my job, but this one is the first time I feel blocked. Considering that I have noticed this problem for over a year now without reporting(not sure what to do), and considering that I feel being a quite experienced user, I can imagine that there are a lot more people who have this problem but do nothing, or run to MSoffice. Going to MSoffice is not an option to me, but I know that people don't have to think the same way. I know now, that it is impossible to work without outlining. After failure for a long time, I've decided to sacrifice my time and outline normally (it always breaks in all my multisheet files) until that indicia comes, but I feel a bit wasted at times (it's been a MONTH of everyday failure, not days). I need help.(In reply to)I 100% agree with you, I work on the code. But as this is a 'hard hack', it's too complex for me to fix ;)Given the difficulty in reproducing the problem and the, blocker is not correct.I've taken the liberty to change it to critical.I will provide as much information as I can gather about this bug, in order to assist the hard hackers.I gambled a little around with 3.4.5 (WIN) and "fdo39484-sample", as expected without quick success. Really a hare nut, thanks to Petr no nominate this one as hard nut.I would like to do a "brute-force test" to try to make this one reproducible, but there still are some questions to be clarified before in beforea) is it 100% clear when the loss happens?a1) you see outlines missing after FILEOPEN, but do not know whether might have been lost during FILESAVE, because you did not try to open with other software before edits?a2) definitivly FILESAVE, groups lost for all other software when FILEOPENa3) definitivly FILEOPEN, I tried with an other software and still saw the missing group(s)b) Am I right that normally only some groups are lost and replaced by hiding the rows / columns, but normally not all?b1) yesb2) no, but ...c) do we have any document set showing a before/after loss. I would prefer something like Winfried Donkers' sample what is simple enough for quick tests (might be with macro aid)c1) yesc2) no, but ...d) due to "fdo39484-sample.ods" contains hundreds of ODF errors. Are sample documents with valid ODF 1.2 (strict) available?d1) yesd2) no(In reply to)I see outlines missing during a workflow, not affected by FILEOPEN, not sure if affected by FILESAVE. If the document is saved with correct outlining, the outlining will be there in after FILEOPEN. If the outlining breaks during the workflow and saved, it will not be there after FILEOPEN.I have not tried other software. I use LO (linux).The outlining breaks a single sheet or more sheets, not parts of sheets. There are times that I have noticed some sheets broken, while others remain unaffected, although it seems certain that they will break at some point during the workflow, they always break . Most times I've noticed all sheets broken.My basic problem of reproducing the bug is that it happens in an unfocused sheet and there seems to be a random aspect. The closest I've come to it, was when once the +- buttons on horizontal grouping were visible but not responding to clicks or shortcuts for hide/show. After switching sheet and back again , buttons were gone and grouping was lost.My samples might not be "simple enough for quick tests" as they are 10MB 260sheet, but I can send you two samples in case you want to check out.I've always had the setting ODF format version: 1.2 Extended (recommended) in the Options menu.Createdsample of document with outlining before breakageCreatedsample of document with outlining after breakage@koukasio (In reply to):Thank you, that helps a lot. I will do some tests and research with your documents asap (unfortunately rather busy currently).@all:Can you please submit separate bugs for all similar problems what are not "loss of all groups during workflow" weth "related to this one"? Although all these problems might have the same roots, dividing the problem into smaller parts might ease tests and finding those roots.I did some first investigation in contents.xml of sample "2013-03-02 10:36 UTC," and related broken document.

Only to get an idea how much edits might be needed to have a chance to see something interesting(In reply to)We have not noticed grouping/notes losses with versions prior to 3.6.4 (all Windows), except possibly once (with version 3.5.something) in November 2012.In our cases, all losses happened when the document was saved and was noticed when openened the next time. That is to say, grouping (sometimes notes as well) gets lost on a complete sheet, which need not necessarily be the sheet in view. So in some cases, the loss of grouping/notes was only noticed some time later.The groupings (notes) are simply not saved for that sheet, I examinated several backups and studied the xml-content.It may be that I do not understand your question, but when it happens _all_ grouping (rows and columns) are gone on a sheet. I cannot say whether it happened on one sheet only or or one or more sheets, but it did not happen on all sheets. The sheet(s) with lost grouping (notes) were often not the selected/visible sheets.Yes, I have several documents before and after as we have a lot of backups. I cannot upload them as they are (the documents include information from customers) to freedesktop. I can upload one or more fods with sensitive information removed, I can also send them (ods) as an attachment to Rainer or Petr directly on the condition that they are used discretely.The documents with which we experienced the grouping/notes loss were all xls-docuemnts (Excel 2000) that were converted to odt in the autumn of 2010 and used with LibreOffice since. So yes, ODF-errors can be expected in the documents.I include 'notes' when I say grouping, as the loss of notes occurs together with the loss of grouping (in the same tab). I cannot say with certainty that grouping loss did not occur without notes loss, but the other way round (notes have not been lost without groups being lost) is definitivelt true.We have 8 people editing a total of 20-100 of calc-documents like the fdo39484-sample. Some are edited several time a day, some only once a year. We only noticed the data loss since December, 2012 and only found two documents which suffered data loss (we checked more than 50 of these documents that were modified in November/December 2012 and January 2013). One of these two documents, suffered data loss several times. My suspect is that it is a combination of document-content (ODF-error?) and FILESABE handling of LibreOffice. The people that edit these two documents regularly have downgraded to version 3.5.7. Since then we have not noticed grouping/notes losses.As it looks to me that it is document-related, the ratio with which the bug happens could be less than 1/1000 for documents in general or 1/10 (a guess) for susceptible documents.(In reply to)When trying to notice, I keep checking back an forth for any losses. At some point I find it really frustrating to keep checking but there comes a point of breakage. So I can tell you that it is more than 100. 100000 sounds too much. Maybe a class of 100-10000.@koukasio: Ah, you set the blocker severity again. I understand that it is a blocker for you but it is not blocker for most other users who do not use this feature. The broader view is important in the time based release process, see. I am sorry to say but this bug could not and will not block 4.0.1 release and any further bugfix releases. I leave the severity as is because I am not able to persuade you and do not have possibility to make it read only. Any shufling just create mess and is waste of time. The current severity does not reflect reality and will be ignored in the release process decisions.(In reply to)I did nothing, I expect your apology...(In reply to)Apology is all mine, I was changing the severity of the bug accidentally, maybe something to do with the refreshing of the page in my browser. I am sorry for the mess I've caused.Winfried - does this continue with LibreOffice 4.0 ? - I had a go at reproducing it; cranked down the undo level to only 2 steps to try to provoke things some more [ no joy ], did a number of random hide/show / column deeletion etc. The sample sheet is rather beautiful !

Not yet 4.0 asblocks necessary functionality for us (haven't tested 4.0.3 yet though).Should we encounter grouping/notes loss, I will report asap, with version and if possible fods files before and after.

I keep using this feature (even though the dissapointment is big at points) for debugging purposes, in case of an enlightenment... I am still having it in all multisheet files which become a little complex...There has been loss of outlining before in the attached document history.

Would that mean anything to you?I am very awkwardly suspicious about the "undo" thing. There's other things that I've noticed when "undo"ing , I wonder if I should report them as bugs.

Unfortunately I tried to reproduce it but failed. It happened while I was working on sample2. The steps that took place were EditâSheetâSelectâCtrl+a(all) and then I did insert columns, merge cells, undo stuff. I was checking the outlining. At some point I pointed with the mouse at the "+" sign of the outlining but was not pressable.

Given the content I cannot make them attachments of this public bug, but I can send them directly to the developer working on this bug. I can however upload fods files with the client information removed, allthough I fear that both files will be valid and the difference will be that one file has grouping setting for n sheets and the other has grouping settings for n-1 sheets (the settings are simply not there, they don't seem corrupted).@Winfrieddo you still reproduce this bug with recent 4.0.4 or 4.1.0 releases?(In reply to)AFAIK we haven't encountered this bug with version 4.0 (4.1 isn't ready for company use yet).The bug occurs very rarely, but -given the data loss- it is a bad one.My guess is that it is connected to certain (long existing) files. With two files it has occurred multiple times, with hundreds of other files is has never occurred (and these files all have the same base file from which they originate, first an xls-file, now an ods file).so are you saying that it has never reoccurred yet in 4.0.x or that it still happens rarely? or that it happened rarely in 3.6.x...(In reply to)The bug hasn't occurred with version 3.5.5 or earlier (we think), it seemed to start with 3.6, but we know of at least one instance when the bug occurred with version 3.5.7.We upgraded from 3.5.7 to 4.0.4 and so far, I have not received reports of the bug.(BTW we are currently moving the data from these calc-documents to our ERP-platform, which means that we are likely to experience the bug even less, as these calc-documents become read-only once the data is moved. I will so be of limited 'use' with respect to this bug.)Ok Winfried.I'm gonna set status as WORKSFORME since you said it's not happening anymore in 4.0.x even if we don't know what fixed it.feel free to REOPEN this report if you will reproduce it again in 4.0.x or 4.1.x(In reply to)I have confirmed that the bug exists with 4.0.X with newly created files(not old ones)... I have been updating to the latest releases of libreoffice to help debugging. The problem is not fixed. I am still trying to figure out what is happeningI don't want to change any status bymyself but I think that it is wrong to state as resolved. I will keep trying to help@koukasiook. I reopen the bug and move it to the mab4.0 list.it would be very important to obtain a test case and instruction to reproduce.I want to start with an introductory paragraph, which contains the most important information of this comment according to my non-technical judgment:The bug occured repeatedly after changing cell formatting globally in the sheet. The cause for global change of cell formatting can be deletion of a user-defined format code, change of the default settings in "Styles and Formatting" in the "Format" menu or similar changes.And now the long version:The reported bug causes a siginificant annoyance in my work with LO Calc for more than a year. I had not reported the bug because I cannot reproduce it. Today I found this bug report accidentally and realised that other users encounter the same problem and that reproducing the bug is not easy for them either.I encounter the bug in a rather big and complicated spreadsheet, which I had started setting up with MS Excel 2007. To migrate from MS Excel to LO Calc I had converted the sheet by saving it as XLS with MS Excel, loading it with LO Calc and then saving it as ODS with LO Calc. Since then I kept developing the spreadsheet considerably, and the bug occurs from time to time.The spreadsheet contains 18 worksheets, the cells contain several thousand links to other cells, and the spreadsheet size is 2 MB in ODS file format. I cannot share the file for confidentiality reasons.The bug occured with LO 3.5 and LO 3.6. I remember to have encountered the bug with LO 3.4 as well, but I am not absolutely sure about the occurrence in LO 3.4. I have not switched to LO 4.0 yet, because the bug had occured in my spreadsheet after version changes (i.e. when opening the sheet with the new version), so that I am very conservative with updating LO program versions. Besides, LO 4.0 contains another unrelated bug in LO Impress, which is significant for my work and which does not occur with LO 3.6. Currently I work with LO 3.6.7.2 under Windows 7 with 32-bit architecture (x86).If the bug occurs, I lose the groupings of columns and rows on all worksheets. However, I am not absolutely sure, if the bug might have occured by affecting only some worksheets in the spreadsheet. I think that the bug was not related to saving or opening the spreadsheet. Again I am not sure about it. I lost the comments in cells of the worksheet as well. Therefore, I gave up using comments. I can work on the spreadsheet without using comments, but I do not get along without grouping columns and rows. Therefore, my experience with the bug concentrates on loss of grouping columns and rows.Since I had found out that the bug occured mainly when changing cell formats globally (see introductury remark of this comment), I could minimise its frequency of occurrence. Nevertheless, the bug can still occur unexpectedly.There is a high probability that the bug occurs in my spreadsheet if I do a series of global cell format manipulations. I tried to reproduce it with a simple spreadsheet, which I had converted from XLS or XLSX to ODS. I was not able to produce the bug with a simple spreadsheet.I am not a developer. I assume that a comment like this one is technically of limited use. Nevertheless, I want to share my experience with this bug. Maybe my description helps though it is not extremely precise. Moreover, it documents that there are more users out there, who struggle considerably with the effects of this bug.A big thank you to everyone who has tried and will try to hunt down this bug considering its complexity and the difficulty to reproduce it with a simple spreadsheet.Createdreproduction_sampleHALLELUJAH!!!!!!!!I have managed to reproduce the bug!!!!Let's get serious...I am attaching the fileThe steps to follow are:go to sheet named '1'select row 15InsertâRowsselect row 16cutpaste to row 15undoVoilÃ !!Go to sheet named '2'... grouping/outlining is lost!!I hope this is useful, this thing has been such a pain for so long!!I started building the document yesterday on lo 4.1.0.4 on Ubuntu 12.04 , 08/16/2013, 15:41:44 .I started it from scratch , no M$ windows, office etc.The template I am using was started a year before on something like lo3.5. Would you like me to attach my template as well?(In reply to)I confirm the getting lost of the grouping in sheet 2, using version 4.0.4.2 on Windows 7 and using version 4.2.0.0.alpha0+ on openSUSE 12.3Unfortunately, I am not familiar with in this part of the calc code, so I can't try to fix it.I add Kohei Yoshida to CC list. maybe he can help.(In reply to)I can reproduce the loosing of grouping in other calc documents as well:-select sheet before sheet with grouping-select row n-paste somewhere-undo : the grouping in th enext sheet is lostI have not tried other combinations, the steps inand above should be a sufficient starting point for a developer.koukasio - brilliant :-) thanks so much for the reproduction steps; it's fantastic to finally have a good way to reproduce this.(In reply to)It is the lo-people to thank, I am just a humble user :-) I hope I am being helpful...(In reply to)Instead of rows, columns can also be used to reproduce the loosing of grouping in the next tab sheet. I have not been able yet to loose the comments with these steps.I did a bit of work on this; the undo object is ScUndoPaste:ScUndoPaste::DoChange (this=0xae48eb8, bUndo=true) at /data/opt/libreoffice/master/sc/source/ui/undo/undoblk.cxx:896Seems to do some rather odd things - it appears eg. to touch other sheets than the current one (on which the operation is done) - no idea why:937 for (size_t i = 0, n = maBlockRanges.size(); i < n; ++i)938 {939 ScRange aCopyRange = *maBlockRanges[i];940 aCopyRange.aStart.SetTab(0);941 aCopyRange.aEnd.SetTab(nTabCount-1);942 pDoc->CopyToDocument( aCopyRange, nUndoFlags, false, pRedoDoc );943 bRedoFilled = true;Which of course only fills the redo data - but appears to copy every sheet rather than the current one [ perhaps that has something to do with it ] - still thinking ;-)(In reply to)I lose the the comments as well if I use koukasio's sheet fromand follow the described steps. After opening koukasio's sheet, the cursor is on sheet "2" in cell A12. I insert a comment in this cell. It is lost after following the steps in.I use Windows 7 with 32-bit architecture (x86).I assumed inthat the loss of grouping can be related with global changes of cell formatting. I could not verify this suspicion with koukasio's sheet. My assumption ofseems to be wrong.(In reply to)Forgot to mention: LO 3.6.7.2(In reply to)@Michael: when you've thought it out ;-) , but haven't got the time to code and test, I am willing to help fixing this. It is a very annoying bug at our company. Having said that, I won't be able to do any coding in the first half of September.Not that it's news but this:void ScUndoPaste::DoChange(bool bUndo)... for (size_t i = 0, n = maBlockRanges.size(); i < n; ++i) { ScRange aRange = *maBlockRanges[i]; ScMarkData::iterator itr = aMarkData.begin(), itrEnd = aMarkData.end(); for (; itr != itrEnd && *itr < nTabCount; ++itr) { aRange.aStart.SetTab(*itr); aRange.aEnd.SetTab(*itr);** pUndoDoc->UndoToDocument(aRange, nUndoFlags, false, pDoc); } }line - when uncommented avoids the issue occuring; I guess that's the core of Undoing pastes though ;-)Interestingly though, the *itr is 4 for this - and the inner loop only occurs once; 4 seems a plausible value for nTab called '1' which I'm editing; which looks correct.void ScDocument::UndoToDocument(const ScRange& rRange,...... if (nTab2 < static_cast<SCTAB>(maTabs.size())) CopyToDocument( 0,0,nTab2+1, MAXCOL,MAXROW,maTabs.size(), IDF_FORMULA, false, pDestDoc, pMarks );Appears to do a giant copy to undo a paste - of all the formulae in the document - which seems a tad steep. Either way - disabling that un-breaks the groups too.void ScTable::CopyToTable(... pDestTab->SetOutlineTable( pOutlineTable ); // auch nur wenn bColRowFlagsDisabling this line stops us loosing the grouping; so - I guess that pOutlineTable is NULL in the undo information - which is interesting - but why only for this one sheet ? why don't we loos more :-)The hunt continues ...(In reply to)Please keep hunting ;)BTW, we did have a loss of grouping and of grouping_and_comments (all cell comments on a sheet). I can't tell if we experienced loss in more than one sheet at a time, especially as we didn't know what caused the loss and loss in more sheets could have been caused by more than one undo action.Another interesting data-point is that this is exclusive to cut/paste, copy/paste doesn't suffer from the same issue; so back up to:bool ScViewFunc::PasteFromClip( sal_uInt16 nFlags, ScDocument* pClipDoc,The more I read this the more I marvel at what is going on - it looks rather fragile. It appears that the code wants to preserve formulae on ~all sheets so we can undo the effects of cut/paste.Unfortunately, the CopyToDocument method has two modes of operation: one where every tab is present (when it really copies the range you pass), and another when tabs are not present (when it only copies to existing tabs).First we try to CopyToDocument with a limited set of (the selected) tabs - to just copy that data for undo; so we only copy the outline data for sheets that are active. // all sheets - CopyToDocument skips those that don't exist in pUndoDoc SCTAB nTabCount = pDoc->GetTableCount();+ if ( bCutMode )+ {+ // fdo#39484 - needs to be done before the CopyToDocument to preserve+ // outline & other data on sheets that we're not viewing.+ pUndoDoc->AddUndoTab( 0, nTabCount-1 );+ }fixes that; but of course it then starts to copy far too much.Then unfortunately, we do another copy into the pUndoDoc here: pRefUndoDoc->CopyToDocument( 0,0,0, MAXCOL,MAXROW,nTabCount-1, IDF_FORMULA, false, pUndoDoc );Which is presumably intended to preserve formulae, however this was again not constructed for all tabs, so it now overwrites the outline data with NULL dummy data.So ... it seems that the basic problem here is a mis-understanding of how CopyToDocument interacts with outlining. We pass the IDF_FORMULA flag, but the code then operates on far more than just formulae.Having fiddled a fair bit here; I think the best sol'n is to add an IDF_OUTLINE - or IDF_NOOUTLINE bit to add in there, to allow the IDF_FORMULA mask to only mutate formulae. Or worse - add some IDF_FORMULAONLY - which would suck ;-) I'll try to come up with something pleasant.I just pushed a prototype fix; quite possibly it severely harms the rest of calc [ I hope not, but you never know ], and I'm no calc engineer. Looking forward to some testing of copy / paste / move etc. with outlines around - AFAIK there are no unit tests for this lot (anyone wanting to write them would be more than welcome). Things to look out for when testing:the code involved tries to restore formulae to the state they were in before the cut/paste - so worth checking some cases of this to make sure they are. Anyhow - I hope it will be in some master builds to play with in due course, and at some stage we can back-port it :-)Thanks so much for the reproducible test-case; it looks like this issue has been there for years.Michael Meeks committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#39484 - don't loose outlines while trying to undo formulae changes.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.Eike seemed happy with it so it's:for -4-1. If that doesn't cause any concern after a release, we could back-port it to 4-0 I imagine in a month or so.Closing for now; do ping in a month if you're desperate for a -4-0 backport.(In reply to)Thanks a lot for your fast -and informative- digging and fixing!I will test with master if I can reproduce the problem with the comments getting lost (I hope I can't).Michael Meeks committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-4-1":fdo#39484 - don't loose outlines while trying to undo formulae changes.It will be available in LibreOffice 4.1.2.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

We have found that Scalable Vector Graphics in LibreOffice is inconsistent and incorrect on both operating systems. The attached compressed file is provided to show how the same Scalable Vector Graphics is inconsistent and incorrect in Writer and Draw. We were able to use SVG images in a previous release.I saw a similar problem wrongly reported in, might be DUP or related:<> (seehere)"- CRASH when insert particular SVG picture from file" might be DUP or at least related?It seems that there is some vulnerability, some .svg crash MAC, some others WIN, and may be some others Linux?@reporter, @tommy27, @xdmx:Can you please checkand leave your results there in a comment?Also no problem with WRITER - Master "LibO-dev 3.4.5 â WIN7 Home Premium (64bit) English UI [(Build ID:d337f79-a24c961-2865670-9752b71-7f8fd43 2fdd60d-fd28b6a-fd7bf20-aa369cb-28da3fb 6a9633a-931d089-ecd263f-c9b55e9-b31b807 82ff335-599f7e9-bc6a545-1926fdf)]"I can see no crash or warning under valgrind with current Linux x86_64 3-4 (will be 3.4.3)I can confirm this happens with LibO 3.4.3 rc1 on Snow Leopard 10.6.8 - same issue if you drag from desktop into doc.

crash 3.4.3 on Mac OSX.AlexTested against :LibreOffice 3.3.4 : no crash, but clouds appear behind moon.NeoOffice 3.2 patch 5 : no crash (but transparent objects not correctly rendered)NeoOffice 3.1.2 patch 8 : no crash, but objects mangled.Symphony 3 : refuses to load image in Impress (no Draw module)OOo-dev 3.4 : no crash, but clouds appear behind moon.AlexI can also confirm this crash (Insert

Perhaps it relies on the layout code being in a given state when we exit.The banal patch:--- a/sw/source/core/layout/ftnfrm.cxx+++ b/sw/source/core/layout/ftnfrm.cxx@@ -1897,7 +1897,7 @@ void SwFtnBossFrm::RemoveFtn( const SwCntntFrm *pRef, const SwTxtFtn *pAttr, { OSL_ENSURE( pRef->IsTxtFrm(), "NoTxtFrm has Footnote?" ); SwTxtFrm* pMaster = (SwTxtFrm*)pRef->FindMaster();- if( !pMaster->IsLocked() )+ if( pMaster && !pMaster->IsLocked() ) pMaster->Prepare( PREP_FTN_GONE ); } }Might fix the symptom, if not the underlying problem, but lots of other FindMaster results are used unchecked.

Currently LibO is unusable for scientific texts or other ones with many footnotes. This is even more serious because users suffering from an other footnote problem (,,(all fixed for 3.4.2?)) can not upgrade.So I decided to rate this one as a blocker. Please feel free to downgrade Importance if you see higher-ranking interests to get released 3.4.2 asap.I also saw the crash with a daily build nearby "LibreOffice 3.4.1 - WIN7 HomePremium (64bit) German UI [OOO340m1 (Build:101)]"Adding my humble opinion, I fully agree to rate this as a blocker. Particularly the less technically experienced researchers are afraid of having lost data due to this bug (I can name at least two plus myself). This cannot be unfixed in 3.4.2 particularly if it should be ready for enterprise and professional deployment.Createdpatch for debugging the issueI debugged a bit around this.The issue after all is that the assertion at:fires: "Follow ist lost in Space."I created the attached debug code to see when things go wrong:- After loading, the doc looks sane- After inserting a char the doc looks sane- After saving, the doc looks sane- At the start of SwView::~SwView() the doc looks saneSo the issue is likely that the destruction of the layout does something in the wrong order while destructing itself.To use the patch (which is never intended to be commited obviously), apply it, compile sw with "make DBGLEVEL=2" and type: p debug_checkCntntNodeFollow(debug_GetLastLoadedDoc())in gdb. The debugcode needs some more tuning to work well during destruction, because it gets the RootFrm from the SwDoc, which is disconnected rather early.HTH a bit.I could to really figure out what is going on there, but this looks really, really wrong:#14 0xae679dca in SwRootFrm::~SwRootFrm (this=0x8b42e40, __in_chrg=<valueoptimized out>) at/data/opt/libreoffice/libreoffice-3-4/sw/source/core/layout/newfrm.cxx:606#15 0xae679e3b in SwRootFrm::~SwRootFrm (this=0x8b42e40, __in_chrg=<valueoptimized out>) at/data/opt/libreoffice/libreoffice-3-4/sw/source/core/layout/newfrm.cxx:624To me that looks like the SwRootFrm thinks it is a member of itself. It calls its own destructor on the same instance (itself) upon leaving the scope of the destructor. While I think that cant be right, it can be even less right with the SwRootFrm being owned by the ViewShell (via boost::shared_ptr<>), so the only one ever calling a ~SwRootFrm destructor should be that shared_ptr<>.Unfortunately, I havent figured it out completely -- all I see is that I jump from the last line of the destructor to the first one of it in the debugger.Most likely the cause is somewhere in writer:0382ef89c6631ec39b98b63dbdadd85ecea11275, but that one is not-so-small.Createdpatch for debugging the issueupdated patch to check the consistency of the layout. Im giving up for now (after all it is weekend and vacation for me).Ok, one final suspicion: at#13 0xae6b11b3 in SwLayoutFrm::~SwLayoutFrm (this=0x8b42e40, __in_chrg=<valueoptimized out>) at/data/opt/libreoffice/libreoffice-3-4/sw/source/core/layout/ssfrm.cxx:607the SwLayoutFrm has already been removed from the layout tree in the line before, so when FindMaster iterates backwards through the tree it cant find its Master, because that is in the other tree. Dunno why this would have worked before then though (maybe by some evil Doc->IsInDtor() magic?)(In reply to)I see the crash also with LO-3.4.0-final on SLED11-SP1-x86_64 => it is an older bug. Nobody escalated it earlier, so it can't block the 3.4.2 release. We are sorry but affected users need to wait for LO-3.4.3 release.BTW: The crash happens when people close the document. It usually happens when people close the whole application => It is ugly, it might block saving other opened documents but it should not cause that much harm in most cases.Createdstructure of the layout at the beginning of destruction and at the time of crashIn the attached file, you will find a representation of the layout at the beginning of the destruction and which frms are already deleted at the crash.You will find that the text frame 0x7fffc1fb4228 is already removed from the layout but still has a follow, the text frame 0x7fffc1fb4330, that is still in the layout.

Crashlog added.Hi, is the fix for this bug planned to go into 3.4.3?@Petr: referring to your, there are several reasons to rate this bug as a release blocker, although it might be 'alive' for quite some while. Reasons:First, the bug can definitively result in data loss. How to reproduce: (1) Open attached document by gerdl, (2) make minor changes to the document and save it, (3) open any other document and make changes to it, but don't save it, (4) close the first document. -> Result: LibreOffice crashes and all changes to the second document are lost.Second, the bug already has seven duplicatesThird, it affects many documents (containing footnotes), not only few.Please reconsider your decision not to five this bug a 'blocker' status. Thanks.Three more points of advocacy, I'll be brief:1. Users may be under-reporting this bug because there is no indication the crash/recovery cycle is due to footnotes or endnotes. I had a difficult time tracing it to this bug. In fact, the crash does not seem like a crash. WinXP does not give the usual crash response. The program just closes after closing a document, which would be normal in MS Word.2. Users may be under-reporting this bug because they are still on the 3.3 branch.3. Almost all academic publishing uses footnotes, or more commonly, endnotes. All my documents crash, so far.(In reply to)I would stronly support these tree points. I have lots of dokuments with footnotes. For this reason I have gone back to 3.3 branch.FindMaster crasher remembers me of something I fixed a while ago:I can't remember for sure the cause of this hack... and I'll try it on 3.4 to see if it fixes the crasher.(In reply to)Tested to backport this patch on 3.4: works nicely with it.

Switching to English input language enable hotkeys once again.This is very frustrating as user needs to switch language to save document, to make it bold, or italic, etc. [This is an automated message.]This bug was filed before the changes to Bugzilla on 2011-10-16. Thus itstarted right out as NEW without ever being explicitly confirmed. The bug ischanged to state NEEDINFO for this reason.

Launch Writer.2. Change language to Russian.3. Press Cmd+B to change font weight to bold.Error: Font weight does not get changed. System error sound is played instead.Expected: Font weight changed to bold.Note that some other system hotkeys work as expected. I.e. Cmd+S to save, or Cmd+O to open document still work regardless of input language. Other critical key combinations that don't work: Cmd+I, Cmd+U and so on, all text manipulation hotkeys are English-only. One may assume that hotkeys don't work correctly in text area, but do work for UI.Workaround 1: Click toolbar button to apply corresponding style.Workaround 2: Change language to English, press desired hotkey, then switch language back to russian.The issue is critical, as it make text editor very slow for keyboard-only typing.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Reproduced in 6.6.4.3 on Mac OS X 10.7.5.I also confirm this in LibreOffice 3.6.3, and it is really annoying to change keyboard to En, only to use a shortcut and then change it back to whatever it was and then continue.I use Fedora, but this problem was not occurred in Fedora 17 or Windows, as they both use a different keyboard handling method than Fedora 18 (). But now in Fedora 18, lots of program are affected by this change.Applications such as gedit, nautilus, fileroller (Archive Manager) which are parts of gnome act like before, which means there is no difference which keyboard layout is currently active, the keyboard shortcuts work OK. But other applications usually is not the same, like LibreOffice, Zim, Blender, ... .So, I don't know where the problem is, but as (let say native) gnome applications are working fine, so there must be a way to solve this problem with others.The problem still exist in LibreOffice 3.6.5.2 in Fedora 18.I realy dont know why no developer really pay attention to fix this problem.It may looks like that it is not important but it really affected the productivity of LibreOffice for non-Latin users.Today I downloaded LibreOffice 4.0.0.3 from the official website and the problem still is there.I also install all available desktops in Fedora 18 repo and test LibreOffice against theme to check whether the problem of keyboard shortcuts in non-latin layout is steal exist or not:KDE: No problemMATE: No problemXFCE: No problem LXDE: Problem existCinnamon: Problem existAll the three first desktops still use the same keyboard handling as they used to be, but Cinnamon is based on gnome 3 and inherits its problems, and I have no idea about LXDE problem.I really hope someone at last pay some attention to this problem and attempt to fix it.Today I also use the JHBuild tool on Fedora 18 to compile the Gnome 3.7.5 from their external module sets which contain the released tarbals. ()Well, not too surprising, the problem is still exist using Gnome 3.7.5 and LibreOffice 4.0.0.3. This means that LibreOffice needs to make some changes in its keyboard shortcut handling, as it's likely that gnome is not and will not follow its old keyboard management.I am really hoping some developer at least look at this bug and put some information or notes here.Here is how some other big open source products fix this issue:Mozilla:Eclipse:According to this page Chromium fix this in version 3.0.196 afterwards, so it might have something helpful:And also a patch for Gnome which I don't know how to make it work:Sorry in last comment I sent the Eclipse link in Mozilla part.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Confirm this bug still exists in LibreOffice 4.0.2.2.Very annoying.

What figures? I did find something. And in just a few clicks.This is not a bug! It's simply a matter of configuration.For the regular keyboard shortcuts (like Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, etc.) to remain operational in LibreOffice applications while using a non-latin keyboard layout (like Greek or Russian), go to Tools -> Options -> Language Settings -> Languages, check the Ignore system input language option, save, and Bob's your uncle.Hope this helps.Cheers!PSTechnically, though, shortcuts still remain language-dependent. This means if you enable this option, you will have to set your document languages manually.The problem is with formatting shortcuts like Ctrl-B/Command+B and Ctrl-I/Command+I shortcuts that still donât work after Setting âIgnore system input language optionâ.

id=42470	Steps to reproduce:1. Make sure no soffice process is already running2. Start LibreOffice with the command "libreoffice --nodefault"3. The splash screen appears. (This is the correct behaviour)4. The LO initial window appears. (This shouldn't happen!)This is a regression to the behaviour of LO/OOo in previous versions (before 3.4). -nodefault did not open a visible window.Maybe this was an intentional change because the help text for --nodefault reads:"don't start with an empty document"which is kind of ambiguous but the Ubuntu manpage is much clearer:"Starts the application without any window opened for the first time."(Regarding the bad documentation of the parameter, see also)Anyway, I see no reason why the behaviour of --nodefault was changed and this should be fixed. (In reply to)The effect you seek is obtained with "--invisible"; it also suppresses the splash screen.I rather like that --nodefault gives me a choice what to do instead of dumping me in an empty writer document. I can choose between opening an existing file, creating a new base / writer / calc / ... file.(In reply to)And what if I want to see the splash screen but not the window? That's the effect I seek. And since ages that effect could be achieved with "--nodefault". Not anymore with LibreOffice 3.4.The effect you seek is just starting "soffice" without a parameter.Anyway, let's not get into the "it's not a bug, it's a feature" argument. This is clearly a regression and you would need very, very good arguments to justify willingly breaking all programs/scripts/etc out there which depend on the known behaviour of "--nodefault".To illustrate the scope of the problem, it should also be mentioned that bootstrapping LibreOffice in Java using the com.sun.star.comp.helper.Bootstrap class, also launches the soffice process with the "-nodefault" parameter. Which means that every Java program out there using the well-documented (and also used in the examples of the LibreOffice SDK) way to bootstrap OOo/LibO suddenly behaves differently with LibO 3.4 and opens a window that wasn't there before. Am I the only one who sees this as problematic?And to give you a specific example (since we were asked at the last LibreOffice Hackfest in Munich to mention in our bug reports if the bug affects the Municipality of Munich and its OOo/LibO migration): This bug is highly relevant to us in Munich because our OOo extension "WollMux" is one of the above mentioned programs and we also have other tools which bootstrap OpenOffice in this way. And it is absolutely unacceptable for us that any window is opened in this case.You might say "Just modify your own code to use --invisible instead of --nodefault" but sadly that's not really an option, since we aren't explicitly starting soffice with the --nodefault parameter ourselves but just using OOo/LibreOffice's Bootstrap class and that's not our code. So if you really don't want to fix this bug, at least document the change and update the bootstrap helper classes in the SDK.But my suggestion would be to just change "--nodefault" to behave as it always did. That's the best and easiest solution.(In reply to)No, that creates a new (empty) writer document and puts me in LibreOffice writer. I don't particularly care if the effect I seek is --nodefault or another way, but I'd like to keep a way to achieve it, some way or the other.I see. Then indeed, it is part of external API, and its behaviour should not have changed like that.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***I can reproduce the issue with LibreOffice 3.4.4 on Linux and on Windows. However, daily builds from libreoffice-3-5 branch and from master behave as expected on Linux: --nodefault does not open LibreOffice windows, just displays the splash screen. On Windows, daily builds from libreoffice-3-5 branch and from master behave wrong, they open a LibreOffice windows with the start center.Removing from the Most Annoying Bugs - this is not a bug affecting majority of users, is it?(In reply to)Well, I don't know if it is affecting the majority of users but as explained in the comments above it is affecting every single application which uses the officially documented way to bootstrap LibreOffice by means of the Bootstrap Java class. Also, everybody who just used "libreoffice --nodefault" in scripts etc. to launch LibreOffice.So, I don't know what exactly the criteria for the "Most Annoying Bugs" list are (as I wasn't the one who put it on there) but in my opinion this bug definitely is directly or indirectly affecting enough users (and especially developers of applications interfacing with LibreOffice) that it should be fixed as soon as possible.Sorry for asking: any chance this bug is going to be fixed soon?As far as I'm concerned: I'm maintaining an Octave (www.octave.org) package () that uses (quoted from) the "officially documented way to bootstrap LibreOffice by means of the Bootstrap Java class". After LO 3.3.1 the behavior of this Bootstrap Java Class got broken (see); while most of that has already been fixed, the one remaining issue is the splash screen that still shows up while AFAIK it shouldn't (and me and my users don't want it).We can't fix this on our side, it's LO code that changed its behavior relative to the LO / OOo docs.ThanksI need this fixed as well, if run with libreoffice instead of OpenOffice.org my software (Gnuaccounting,) keeps opening a useless window. As far as I understood JÃ¼rgen this is also one of the reasons why he is really pissed of Libreoffice (he is developer and author of Thera-Pi,, which also embeds OpenOffice.org much better than LibreOffice)+1 from openyabs.orgAs long as the Startparameter-Bug, and here especially the Parameter "--nodefault", will not be fixed, LibreOffice will stay in the status unuseable for all Java-Programmers who embedds OpenOffice in their Software (and for the Users of these Software).And the Tip to take "--invisible" instead of "--nodefault" is not a Tip, it's a gallGruÃJÃ¼rgen Steinhilber+1It's impossible to work with LO > 3.4Sorry. I thought "it's impossible to work with LO >= 3.4"MichaelBecause the same Bug(!) exists in Apache OpenOffice 3.4 i filed the same Bug at the AOO-Project.And the same Bug means that "--nodefault" mustn't open the StartCenter.Contrary to the response of the LO-Team the Apache guys have had a solution at once.And here is the solution for LO:Add " && !rCmdLineArgs.IsNoDefault() " in the module /core/desktop/source/app/app.cxx at line 1675 and everything will be fine.Desolate, desolate, but this is the typically result if one broadcast every day to be the better one, but in the reality most of the code is imported from others.In this case it was the import of a Bug.CheersJÃ¼rgen Steinhilber4Stephan Bergmann committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#42470: Do not show backing window on --nodefaultThis is funny. Finally came around to commit the (rather trivial) patch this morning, only to find out I'm dispraised as somebody who "broadcast[s] every dayto be the better one" (which I can't remember I ever did). I happened to look into this issue earlier this week, and in the course of doing so noticed other catastrophes that demanded more urgent fixing. Also, pathetic comments (just some, not all, for sure) and claim of highest criticality -- is there data loss involved? -- do not generally motivate one to treat such an issue as most urgent. I do understand people's frustration with unaddressed issues, though. (But if it frustrated you so much, you could also have had a stab at fixing it yourself. Would have been a nice easy hack to get involved with the LO code base.)Hi Daniel,That was a secret treasure bug, please contact me RE the details of the payment. You just scored 100â¬. You can ask me to redirect it to any institution you name or if you are freelancer or own a company you can invoice me for the money yourself.I would also be willing to get acquainted with the LO codebase but as far as I am aware the two other bugs really frustrating me are very, very deep and my C++ is not very good.You don't happen to attend the LibreCon 17-19 Oct 2012 do you?Stephan Bergmann committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-3-6":fdo#42470: Do not show backing window on --nodefaultIt will be available in LibreOffice 3.6.1.(In reply to)Hi Stephan,thanks a lot for doing so, and be sure alot of developers and users would like to thank you too (if they could).(and please don't be angry about my "little tough" posts, but I'm dealing with that problem since LO 3.4, trying to make workaraound etc., always with no success.)Thanks once more.JÃ¼rgen(In reply to)...of course I ment "Hi Stephan".As discussed by e-mail, the 100Eur are now donated to the charity organization you mentioned.
id=42534	Problem description: I have a bunch of ODTs created with 3.3.x. Most of them contain a frame on the first page (heavily customized - colored with white border). In 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 all of these files crashed Writer.Using 3.4.3 all but one do not crash writer, but the frame's border is gone - i have to redefine itI have this one file which still crashes writer, i cam send it to whoever thinks it might be useful - it's just 750kbSteps to reproduce:1. Load a odt file2. File loaded having a strange looking frame (no border)3. Crash after a couple of secondsCurrent behavior:Expected behavior:Platform: debian sid - libreoffice 3.4.3 OOO340m1 (Build 302) We should not mix too many problems together. Let's leave this bug for the crash.Please, attach the file that causes the crash. 750kB are fine. The limit is 3GB.Also please try to get backtrace from the crash, seeFinally, open separate bug for the missing frame's border and attache a test file there.BTW: I reduce the severity. It seems to happen with only a particular document => it can't block the whole release.Createdgdb.log on crash after document load (ODT)Hi PetrI will send the odt file causing the crash by email (it's not for the public domain)CheersSpirosThanks for the document.Hmm, I am unable to reproduce the crash. I tested it on two machines. I wonder if you have other fonts or extensions installed, or so.Unfortunately, the backtrace is not much useful without debug information. I see that you have the binaries under /usr/lib/libreoffice => it is not the official build fromWhat Linux distro are you using?Could you please install debuginfo packages and get a better backtrace?Hi PetrI have installed all relevant dbg packages and you can find attached the results of gdb and valgrindI am running aptosid xfce (debian sid)I do have a rather big collection of fonts installed, but that did not seem to be a problem till recently.The extensions i have installed are: Canadian English dictionary Greek dictionary PDF importThank you for your timeCheersSpirosCreatedgdb.log with debugging symbolsCreatedvalgrind.log with debugging symbolsThanks for the last gdb and valgring logs. They might give us some pointers.I add some developers into CC who might be interested into looking at it.I'd need to see a reproducer document. It looks a little like a previous bug where we were casting a SdrObject in a header to another type which was unrelated entirely in order to do some actually fairly useless test on it.BTW, this document demonstratestoo- EDITING: Frame Border Gone under 3.4.3Just a reminder...Well, the immediate crash reported in gdb would be fixed byspecifically by the hunk of sw/source/core/text/txtfrm.cxxI can't reproduce this in 3-4, but from the bt I'm fairly sure the immediate crash would be fixed by backporting the fix mentioned from master.I'll ask on the list if we want this backported.should be good in 3.5, no enthusiasm for backporting to 3.4.X apparently
id=42740	Createdprint screen of the errorCan't finish the installation of LibreOffice 3.3 on windows xp sp3. Unistalled the BRoffice 3.2. Bruno, could you please translate the error dialogs into English? Unfortunately, most developers do not speak Brazilian Portuguese.Anyway, msiexec.exe and msihnd.dll are a basic part of the Windows system. If there are problems with them, you might have troubles also with installing/uninstalling other applications.BTW: 3.3.4 is very old. The 3.4 code line is pretty stable this days. I suggest to try the last 3.4.4 bugfix release.In each case, other people do not report such problem. It must be somehow related to your system. It must not block the whole release => I lover the priority a bit.No reaction, so closed.

fixes for two remaining issues: moduleuiconfigurationmanager.hxx and uiconfigurationmanager.hxx.Thanks. Build finished now here. This issue seems solved.does anyone know what the *root* cause is, casting away const to get operator= working doesn't look right. We have this problem with 3.4.4 as well, but 3.5.0 seems to build fine. Looks like compiler generated an operator=(foo&) instead of operator=(const foo&)problem seems to come from boost::unordered_map's operator=Is this with "system" boost ?, if so what version of boost is it ? This may be triggered by BOOST_COPYABLE_AND_MOVABLE(TYPE)Yes it is from system, version 1.48.0. Some links I'm looking at could help:Just I guess from /usr/include/boost/move/move.hpp: 387 #define BOOST_COPYABLE_AND_MOVABLE(TYPE)\ 388 public:\ 389 TYPE& operator=(TYPE &t)\ 390 { this->operator=(static_cast<const ::boost::rv<TYPE> &>(const_cast<const TYPE &>(t))); return *this;}\ 391 public:\ 392 operator ::boost::rv<TYPE>&() \ 393 { return *static_cast< ::boost::rv<TYPE>* >(this); }\ 394 operator const ::boost::rv<TYPE>&() const \ 395 { return *static_cast<const ::boost::rv<TYPE>* >(this); }\ 396 private:\Line 390, the const_cast seems also to be casting away but the compiler gets lost and guessing kick would be the static_cast operator in left part of the expression, as I still researching.Tried to diff from 1.47.0 but bost/move/move.hpp seems to be new.No problems on my side anymore.Thank you all for the patches.Createdone-liner probable fixSo, I think the problem is really in boost and/or gcc. It happens that 3.5 builds fine because there we enable -std=c++0x when gcc supports it, and then gcc is happy with that move.hpp from boost as a baseclass. How about this attached patch as an alternative.Hi, I've tested your "one-liner probable fix" in one of the reported buildissues and it has solved the problem. It was funny, one of the first things Ihad tried was to force the c++ standard using "-std=c++0x" using g++ commandline output from make for testing and it had *not* worked and now, I retest itusing the same trick and it worked and don't know what I missed. Anyway thealternative proposed fix also worked out :).odd, seems on first reading that boost::unordered_map now uses boost::move and in combo only works in c++11, in which case one wouldn't need boost::unordered_map in the first place :-(pmladek shoved the quick-fix into the 3-4 branch, so "fixed" from that perspective, though this will blow up again if we e.g. upgrade our internal boost to this version and run it through compilers that don't support c++11Sure, was what I'm trying to say in the mail list but my e-mails fall in the moderador approval (checking with Petr): My initial proposed fix is partially right when it to comes to "reimplement the operador=" (not sure about the const casts) whenever the compiler is in the C++03 or bellow mode or even if C++0x is not supported as well using boost 1.48.0 according :.

It might be, that the file had been affected by. If the data series are corrupted, they cannot be repaired automatically, but you have to enter the correct ranges manually.Can you please try, if you can reproduce the error with a document, that is still correct in LO3.3 and will be wrong in LO3.5?

Let me see if I can find the remaining issues.There seems to be a really strange issue in VCartesianAxis::createAllTickInfosFromComplexCategories.TickInfo::fScaledTickValue should store the position of the axis labels but it contains more or less useless data for the second and following categories.Markus Mohrhard committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":correctly set the position of the axis labels, related fdo#44832My patch fixes only the positioning problem. There are even more problems around formatting of the string, transformation of the text shape, ... for the second category and following.I'm not sure if we should include this patch if we don't find someone knowing this code quite well or testing the hell out of the complex category charts. The CWS introducing this bug has already introduced several other issues and this patch while fixing this bug might cause new regressions.Ok, I finally a have a fix that solves all remaining problems. The question is why Ingrid Halama added these lines in the first place.I will not ask for 3-5 review without someone either fully understanding this issue or someone testing these fixes with a set of test documents.I will send the patch for review to the ML and won't include it directly into master.So, is there something that we (common humans) could do?Is there something (version libreoffice 3.5.1 beta)that we could try?Markus Mohrhard committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#44832: Follow-up fix for axis labels for complex categoriesThis patch will not be in the 3-5 release.But there is one thing that would help us quite a lot: It would be great if someone could create a set of test documents containing a lot of different chart features. These would allow us to be safer when we fix bugs and we could try to integrate them into our automatic tests to prevent regressions.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***

(In reply to)The attached document illustrates why this solution is only a partial one. It can only search one sheet at a time.It has no optionsIt must be relaunched for each new searchThe attached document also illustrates how a perfect solution might work (Gnumeric) and how an adequate solution might work.(MS Excel)Version 3.5 is out and this issue has not been addressed. Sadly, I didn't missany of the improvements that we made. I am confident that if the developerswanted to, they could fix this problem.

IMHO only regression or crashing bugs can have this status.(In reply to)If that is the case, I can't. Can you tell me how I can get the developers to give some attention to this bug for which finding a fix is of the highest importance and which needs the most urgent attention? I have been trying for years.It is the only feature of any importance where both OOo and LibreOffice lag behind both MS Excel and Gnumeric.I am agree with you, it is an interesting feature.But I think shout it is not the best to get right attention.Get support from other user, would be good.I don't see this improvement in the list of new features in 3.6:May be is easy to get the attention from developer of the extension.(In reply to)Guess what, of the features listed in the link, I already fixed what I needed by customising menus and using macros.

id=47368	Using Writer with Mac OS X causes many health problems.Alternative title: The unstable version of LibreOffice, labeled as "stable" causes unstable minds.After wasting countless hours redoing lost work, I put that time to a much better use and made this video about the bugs:Here's a quick list of the TOP 5 things crashing Writer:1. Selecting "No Fill" as background color2. Adding a gray border3. Adding a 10pt border4. Adding columns to a footer5. Selecting "Automatic" font colorThese are just the TOP 5.All joking aside, I tested this on 3.5.1, Mac OS X (Snow Leopard and Lion). Clean installations with ~/Application Support/LibreOffice removed prior launching.The version is completely unusable as there are hundreds of things that cause a crash.The only workaround I've found is to use an older version (even the 3.4 has similar problems) or just run Ubuntu on a VM. Now reproduced with:- iMac 27" (2010) with Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8- iMac 24" (2009) with Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3- MacBook Pro (2011) with Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3- MacBook Pro (2007) with Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8On pc Debian x86-64, 3.5 branch updated today (so not exactly 3.5.1), I don'treproduce this problem but perhaps it's mac specific.Just some questions :- do you have any extensions ? If yes, could you disable them and test again ?- On the video, we can see some exceptions, could you copy paste the wholestack trace in a file and attach it here ?Alex Thurgood: isn't there a test you usually propose and which could be usefulin this kind of case (disable accessibility or something) ? It's specific MacOsbut I don't remember it exactly.CreatedEXC_BAD_ACCESSSorry, forgot to include the log before.The only extension I have had on a previous version was the finnish language pack.And not all of the machines that I've tested had that.Other than that, nothing.I happened to have another MacBook Pro for testing where the old installation of Mac OS X had this same problem but after reinstalling the OS, everything worked fine.So there might be something from a previous LibreOffice or OpenOffice installation left that I haven't found.A list of the paths I should just rm -rf to be sure, would be great.Hmm, I just tested disabling accessibility and so far no crashes.I add some MAC developers into CC.I have updated the summary to better describe the problem.We have a workaround, so it can't block the release => lowering the severity a bit.(In reply to)Hi Petr,Yes, unfortunately a known problem, and appears to be getting worse (previously it was sporadic, now it seems to be systematic). Something in LO doesn't like Apple's accessibility API, the question is what and where ?It also means that LO for people with disabilities where the accessibility API is useful on Mac is simply not an option.The debug symbols are not provided with the downloadable Mac DMG as far as I know, which makes debugging nigh on impossible for QA. I've never yet been able to build on Mac from master with debug/symbols enabled.AlexSomething that I found out on a clean installation of OS X was, that every time it crashes, it tried to open Java.Might have something to do with that.(In reply to)I sent a post on dev mailing list about this, seeTested with LO Daily :LOdev 3.6.0alpha0+ Build ID: 278c53c-19dcfb4-e67b1b (build with symbols)Mac OSX 10.6.8 Snow LeopardAssistive Technology device access option activated (first of the lower tick boxes on the General AT tab)Tests run according to video provided on You Tube link by bug reporter.32-bit kernel mode:Test 1Start LO, open New Text DocumentRight click, context menu Paragraph, Background, pick new Colour from paletteExpected result : No crash.

Other than the fact that listening to an American voice trying to pronounce French menu entries drove me half-crazy ;-), I was unable to get LO to crash. I even tried the background colour setting for paragraph context menu, clicking wildly over the palette.

(Iâm on 10.6.8, and I could never manage to reproduce this bug).(In reply to)Sorry for all these posts, but I keep learning ;-):I have finally managed to reproduce-- after installing RightZoom, I can crash LibO 3.5.5.3 reliably by following the description in. Caution: I canât swear thatis identical with this (present) issue, but at least the crash log looks promisingly: Thread 0 which crashed references ... ValueSetAcc::getAccessibleAtPoint() ... com::sun::star::accessibility::XAccessibleContext ... AquaA11yWrapper accessibilityHitTest: ... NSApplication(NSApplicationAccessibility) accessibilityHitTestSo please either try this yourself (just install RightZoom, activate it, and add LibO to the list of allowed applications -- and LibO crashes like a charm ;-),or upload your debug build and give me a link.I confirm the RightZoom does the trick.I was never able to reproduce so far.. I installed RightZoom and activated it for libreoffice (in fact for everything)started lo 3.6 and started the scenrion descriped in msg# It did not fail quite like described be pretty soon it

What did you do to get this crash? My crash log (: just an ordinary MacOS X log, not from a debug build) looks different and contains more references to code points with 'accessibility' in their name. I generated this log via opening an .ods file with some cells with a background color, selecting one of these cells and then selecting "No Fill" from the palette under the Background Fill toolbar button. This crash is 100% reproducible for me with LibO 3.5.5.3. Can you try this, too? I wonder how the dump from your debug build will look ... (I can send you the .ods file I used if it is important.)(In reply to)I created a new empty writer document, right click paragrph.... then clicked on nofillit did not blow up immediatly, so I clicked some other color then nofill then close.. the dialog closed but the app frooze at that point... I even had the time to do a 'sample' via activity monitor... eventualy I got the 'crash dialog with the backtrace attached above. the 'sample' showed the same backtrace***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Due to the DUPs "- AutoFilter CRASH", "- Autofilter CRASH" it's now more or less "All LibO apps."Createdprototype patch for testing ...Clearly the problem with copying the listeners list is the re-enterancy hazard from Call is not well protected against. Well - this, and also that the -whole- VCL window lifecycle is a real train-crash with these listeners for object death instead of hard, properly tracked reference counts.Michael Meeks committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#47368 - fix one potential re-enterancy hazard around even emissionMichael Meeks committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-3-6":fdo#47368 - fix one potential re-enterancy hazard around even emissionIt will be available in LibreOffice 3.6.1.(In reply to)(In reply to)I wondered why it was a bit difficult for Norbert to reproduce this bug even with RightZoom installed ("It did not fail quite like described"); for me, installing RightZoom made crash LibreOffice on selecting nofill for background color immediately. And Norbert's crash log () looks quite different from my own one () -- it does not only contain additional debugging info, but mentions different codepoints, and far less Accessibility stuff as my one.Why?Finally I got it: I testedand this bug with LibO 3.5.5.3, but Norbert's debug build is a debug version of LibO 3.6.0.2. Now LibO 3.6.0.2 (or the whole 3.6.x branch) suffers from: "Text color setting is broken", which makes exactly difficult what is necessary to reproduce this bug with RightZoom: setting the text background color does not work anymore on MacOS. Norbert did not know this, I should have known when I suggested to install RightZoom (), but I just thought about 3.5.x in this issue and forgot totally about...This may explain the difference of the log files. I even fear (but I don't know) thatcurrently "covers" or "hides"and therefore makes it difficult to generate useful debugging info for this present bug by the way I suggested. Maybe because of that Norbert's crash log () has more to do withthan with the present accessibility issue? If so, then we need either to fixfirst and then make another debug build, or to find other ways to get the debug build crash with the accessibility issue ...(In reply to)actually, today, while trying to verify Michael's patch, I could not reproduce the crash anymore, even with the same binary I tested with yesterday :-((In reply to)I canât, too: while I can reproduce the crash so easily with LibO 3.5.5.3, I canât reproduce it with your (Norbertâs) debug build -- I have tried for the 3rd time now. This is why I fear thatcurrently "covers" or "hides" our accesibility issue, at least when testing with RightZoom and selecting a text/background color. So what to do now? Can we create a debug build of 3.5.5 (then I hope I will be able to reproduce the issue for sure)?At the moment, I'm searching all the other duplicates of this present bug and trying to get your (Norbertâs) 3.6.0.2 debug build to crash ... ;-)Michael Meeks committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-3-6-0":fdo#47368 - fix one potential re-enterancy hazard around even emissionIt will be available already in LibreOffice 3.6.0.Thanks to Norbertâs debug version of LibreOffice 3.6.0.2+, I spent several hours trying to reproduce all the different kinds of crashes which are mentioned in this bug report and in all its duplicates. For this I used MacOS X 10.6.8 (Intel) with "Enable access for assistive devices" checked in the System Preferences and RightZoom running (cf.). Now here is a quick overview of my results -- which, I fear, are not as helpful as I had expected. But only the developers can tell.(1) and (2) I can NOT reproduce two kinds of crashes specific to Impress (and). What regards the latter one (sorting slides), this could be explained by, which currently makes sorting slides in LibO 3.6.x on MacOS mostly impossible, and therefore may also "hide".(3) I can reproduce the crash in the LibreOffice Preferences (application "Options") window (,, and probably). See my comment in. For this crash, I got two slightly different kinds of crash logs, seeand. Good news, I hope: both contain explicte references to Accessibility stuff, e.g. XAccessibleContext, XAccessibleComponent, XAccessibleAction. So it may be helpful to look into these log files. I can investigate more, if you want and tell me what to do ...(4) As said above (), I can NOT reproduce the crash which occurs on setting character color and character background color (etc.), and I think -- but I may be totally wrong -- that this has to do with the new. See, again.(5) and (6) But I can reproduce a crash with two similar color-setting related actions (cf.in this report): When I open Writer and add a background color to a paragraph (via Format > Paragraph) or to a table (Via Table > Table properties...), LibO crashes. NB: It may be necessary to click forth and back through the different tabs of the "Paragraph" or "Table Properties" dialog before to get the crash. On both crashes, I get nearly identical log files -- see, and my comments in. Both log files are also more or less identical with Norbertâs log file, cited here in.(7), (8), (9) Many bug reports speak about crashes when adding a border to a cell in Calc or to a paragraph in Writer, or when changing border properties -- see this present report (), andand. I can reproduce this crash in at least three ways: in Calc, when I add a border to a cell (see); in Writer, when I add a border to a paragraph (see) or when I change the border width of a table (see). Cf. my comments in. All three log files are very similar, and they are more or les identical tofrom point (5) above and to Norbertâs log file (). All these log files donât contain explicte references to Accessibility stuff (but only the developers can really judge this). So these crashes seem to have all the same technical background.(10) I can reproduce a freeze or crash related to auto-filter in Calc -- this isand. See my comments in. The log file for the freeze () could be especially interesting, because it contains explicte references to Accessibility stuff. The crash log () may be less interesting (no Accessibility stuff?), but only our developers can judge this.Thatâs it -- my results of several hours spent with making LibreOffice crash, a rather destructive pastime ;-) Hope it helps a bit ...Sorry, tired by too much testing done:Section (10) of the previous comment should read (attachment IDs were wrong!):(10) I can reproduce a freeze or crash related to auto-filter in Calc -- thisisand. See my comments in. The log file for thefreeze () could be especially interesting, because it contains explicte references to Accessibility stuff. The crash log () may be less interesting (no Accessibility stuff?), but only our developers can judge this. And I can't tell what was the difference, i.e. why LibO froze the 1st time and crashes the 2nd time.Hi Roman; so - the fix we pushed potentially catches a ton of segv's that have: VclEventListeners::Call(VclSimpleEvent*) constin the last ~5 or so stack-frames; of course - perhaps it doesn't fix the issue - there could clearly be other badness here; but perhaps it does. It'd be great to test the latest snapshot from Norbert's tinderbox that eg. I hope that:makes it ~impossible to reproduce the bulk of these a11y problems :-) if not, we need to think again of course. If so - we need to back-port this to 3.5 and close it I guess. It'd be really lovely to have some testing of that (if possible !). Thanks :-)(In reply to)I would expect the patch to fix issues (5) to (9) from my list in, and maybe issue (10) -- VclEventListeners::Call is in the crash log (), but not in the log file for the freeze (). But at least issue (3) looks entirely different, so please take a special look at this one.I will do so and report my findings.CreatedCrash log - LOdev 2012-07-24 - Writer, add bkg color to paragraph(In reply to)I fear "we need to think again". I have tested again with the latest master build, i.e. with LOdev 3.7.0.0.alpha0+ (Build ID: 7727f93, installation file: master~2012-07-24_01.17.17_LibO-Dev_3.7.0.0.alpha0_MacOS_x86_install_en-US.dmg), and RightZoom running, and can still reproduce the crashes listed in my...There is only a slight difference in the log files for the crashes. I will not post them all, but attached you find the new log file for case (5) from my distinction in, i.e. for adding a background color to a paragraph in Writer. Please compare this with the old. The first lines of the listing for thread 0 are different ...I can post more log files created on crashes with the new master built, of course, just tell me ;-)Ok - then we badly need that valgrind trace - Norbert ? :-) ...An observation which *could* be helpful in finding the bug:(is fixed now, the color pulldown palettes work again, but neverthelessdoes not return, therefore Winfriedâs and/or Thorstenâs changes in the code for the color pulldown palettes seem to have eliminated the accessibility-related crashes by the way ... could this give a clue about where the bug is?)(In reply to)>Depending on which version you tested - Michael's fix is in recent -3-6, master, and -3-6-0 as well, I'd be more inclined to attribute fixing this to him therefore. ;)if there's good feedback for the patch (and yes it's hard to see how the color selector change could fix any mac a11y problem) I'll cherry-pick it to libreoffice-3-5 ...(In reply to)I tested the latest master build (LOdev 3.7.0.0.alpha0+, Build ID: c549e1e, installation file:master~2012-07-25_02.21.07_LibO-Dev_3.7.0.0.alpha0_MacOS_x86_install_en-US.dmg) with US English langpack installed.I did not want at all to dispute which patch did the job. But it is interesting that from all the ways to make LibreOffice crash which I have listed in, only no. (4) seems no longer reproducible. The ways (5) to (9), which all produce crash logs similar to Norbertâs one (), and towards which Michaelâs patch seems to be directed (because they all involve VclEventListeners::Call() in the topmost stack-frames), are all still reproducible for me with the current master build. This is why I was under the impression that not Michaelâs fix, but some change in the color selector code did the job -- because even cell/paragraph background color selection is fixed only when done via the color pulldown palettes (case (4)), but still causes crashes when done via menu and Cell/Paragraph properties window (case (5)/(6)).But I donât want to dispute ;-) Iâm only a simple-minded QA volunteer. I just want to point out that there remains much to do; besides (5) to (9), also case (3) is still reproducible, and I canât guarantee that (1) and (2) are really fixed -- I canât reproduce them, of course, but maybe this needs some special circumstances (e.g. MacOS X 10.7.x, or running another window management utility, etc.).(In reply to)Please do so. Then we can see if color selection via the color pulldown palettes will be fixed in 3.5.x, too (this would mean that Michaelâs patch did the job, and it will receive all my applause then, as appropriate!), or not (then the 3.6 changes in the code for the color pulldown palettes would be the reason).Michael Meeks committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-3-5":fdo#47368 - fix one potential re-enterancy hazard around even emissionIt will be available in LibreOffice 3.5.6.(In reply to)I have tested again with LibreOffice 3.5.6.1, which contains the patch mentioned above (see), and I am sorry to say that selecting Font Color "Automatic" or Highlighting Color "No Fill" or (paragraph) Background color "No Fill" from the color pulldown palettes or from the "Character" and "Paragraph" dialog windows still crashes LibreOffice 3.5.6.1.

Congratulations to the winner;-) And there are more bugs which are most probably duplicates of this one, too (e.g.,and), so additional duplicates are coming ...(2) This bug has real relevance for many people, because our workaround: to disable MacOS accessibility features completely, is not a suitable workaround for many people with this or that kind of physical impairment. Some days ago, Vincenzo () wrote to the QA list: "Let's take, for instance, the mac os x version of LO: unfortunately it contains tons of accessibility bugs that make impossible to use it for a blind user [...] Just my opinion; maybe I am late, but I decided to share the opinion from my blind-user waiting for an accessible mac os x version of lo perspective..."So we need to stop this discriminating bug -- finally.(3) If no one has got a new idea about how to fix this issue, I want to quote Michael Meeksâs, because this is probably the hard way we need to go now (now, or tomorrow, but not some years in the future ;-):Thank you all!(For the record:I change the Importance field, not because I would believe that this would help anything to fix the issue, but only because QA is discussing about sorting bugs by priority, and therefore we need to get the Importance fields right.Additionally, I put the Whiteboard information into "(...)", to mark this information as a comment, because the issue was not fixed in these releases.)(In reply to)So, how many internets did I win?Not only does this affect people needing accessibility for, well accessibility, but also people using helper applications like window managers that require access to the accessibility API.Granted that fixing it for the visibility impaired is a much more important cause, but still.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***(In reply to)The description ofhas a backtrace containing "hitTestRunner" that looks like arbitrary memory corruption (crashing in pthread_mutex_unlock).***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***So - this is indeed an horribly high priority bug; but - without more information it seems un-fixable; it is clearly a memory corruption bug:so I agree with Stephan.

We need to build around 15 versions of LibreOffice going back in time, to the point that the bug (or it's increase in prevalence) was first introduced - IMHO this is a bug that always existed, so just finding that commit may only bring us a bit nearer to understanding the issue.b) code reading / gdb debugging We need to get good traces with debug symbols - the more precision we have as to which object is bad, the more likely we can find what is going on. This needs a hacker with their own build, -with- debugging symbols, and some clue to delve around / read about.c) valgrind Again, requires a build with debugging symbols to be at all useful; and (if we can reproduce it) will give us an exact pair of line numbers for the problem yielding an ~instant fix. Unfortunately, Norbert couldn't reproduce the problem under valgrind, and/or valgrind on OSX hung LibreOffice (which is a hard nut to crack anyway ;-).My preferred approach is c) it's something that anyone with a build with debugging symbols can work on, and perhaps we'd get some help.We really also need some precise instructions on how to reproduce each of the different symptoms of the underlying issue here that can easily be referred to.Sadly I don't have Mac, so can't help out ...(In reply to)Yep, I can confirm Norbert's experience of valgrind with my own fruitless attempts about some 6-8 months ago.LO no longer builds on OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion for me, even with Stephan's script (that appeared to work for him on OSX 10.7), and independently on two different machines, so I currently have no way of building even a normal version of LO on Mac, let alone a debug build, and I'm not a developer by any stretch of the imagination...AlexFor me, LO builds on 10.8.1 with Clang from Xcode 4.4.1 using the following autogen.lastrun:--disable-binfilter--disable-build-mozilla--disable-mozilla--disable-odk--disable-online-update--enable-debug=cppu/ cppuhelper/ sal/ sfx2/ stoc/ sw/ toolkit/ unotest/ unotools/ vcl/--enable-epm--enable-werror--with-java-target-version=1.5--with-macosx-version-min-required=10.6--with-max-jobs=1--with-num-cpus=1--without-doxygen--without-help--without-helppack-integration--without-myspell-dictsI am not saying that it has to be *exactly* like that; it's just an example.No 3rd-party software used except autoconf and automake.Whether the crash can be reproduced using a LO built thusly I have no idea; Quickly testing, I couldn't, but then I didn't try very hard. The distributed LO is built using a very different tool-chain anyway. (If I am expected to debug this, I want it clearly said that I can use work time on it.)(In reply to)If this means that we need a short âmanualâ listing systematically all known ways to reproduce/trigger this bug, together with step-by-step instructions for each of these ways, and maybe links to the original bug reports, I can take this task ... IMHO a special page in our wiki would be the best solution. Give me some days, and I will create it.(However, if it means something else, please correct me ;-)(In reply to)Tor, thanks for the hint.Which versions of autoconf and automake do you use ? I see autoconf and automake in /Developer/user/share and /Developer/user/bin, but even when I specifically added those directories to my PATH, I still get an error in autogen.sh about not finding autom4te.On the OSX server machine I have no ports installed, just XCode 4.4.1AlexAlex: automake 1.11.3 and autoconf 2.68, built from sources. Do you have a /Developer even if you have Xcode 4.4.1? The latest Xcode installs from the Mac App Store, as a normal self-contained app, as /Applications/Xcode.app, with tverything then under that. At least, that's how it is for me. (Under /Developer I only have some minor leftovers from MonoTouch.) If you have an older version of Xcode, I think automake and autoconf should be present in /usr/bin if you make sure you install the "command-line tools" from inside Xcode. (This no longer happens with the later Xcode versions, for some reason they left out automake and autoconf from the "command-line tools".)(In reply to)Yes, I was previously building on the same machine under OSX 10.6 with XCode 3.2, then upgraded to 10.8 and XCode 4.4.1, so there appear to be quite a lot of /Developer "leftovers" (in fact what looks like most of the /usr/bin file structure for Unix build tools).Yep, noticed that too, and judging from the comments, made a fair few people unhappy in the process.I definitely don't have those tools in /usr or /usr/bin, so will simply try copying them from /Developer/usr/ over to the corresponding directories, then update automake/autoconf as necessary.Alex(In reply to)OK, sussed it, the copy over from /Developer/usr seems to have done the trick. Onto building.Thanks for your help.AlexAlex: Great you can build! the bt you'll be able to generate with --enable-symbols will be very useful.About LO building process on Mac, I just thought it could be useful to have this kind of info (encountered errors, solution, what to check) there:Obviously, the most important first would be the content not the format.Since you've got a Mac and are interested about building, would you be volunteer for updating wiki?The interesting point is since you're not a developer (as you said! :-)), you may mention explicitely elements that could be implicit for a dev.Of course, nothing mandatory here since you're already doing a great QA job for Base part at least and I know too much that time isn't an expandable resource!:-)(In reply to)Hi Julien,I will have a look, but anything I add will be specific to my own particular circumstances I guess.AlexCan somebody give *exact* reproduction instructions with LibreOffice 3.6.1 on Mac OS X 10.8.1? Preferably using only the OS's own accessibility tools. I have tried with VoiceOver but no crash.(In reply to)I have only Mac OS X 10.6.8, and can reproduce the crash only with the help of some 3rd party accessibility-related utility (see below), but here are two step-by-step procedures which crash both LibO 3.6.1 and the current master build (I can give more such step-by-step procedures if necessary):I) Adding a cell border in Calc (cf.,)----------------------------------------------------------0) Rename your LibO user profile folder, to make sure that there is no influence of any special settings on the test (I always do so before such tests).1) Start LibreOffice; -> the Start Center window appears.2) In the Start Center window, click "Spreadsheet"; -> a new spreadsheet document is created, cell A1 is already selected.3) Select "Format > Cells..." from the menu; -> the "Format Cells" dialog window appears.4) Select the tab "Borders".5) At top left, under "Line Arrangement" / "Default", select the second item ("Set all four borders"); -> the border preview below changes.6) Click "OK". -> LibreOffice crashes.II) Selecting a pane in the application Options window (cf.,, and probably)--------------------------------------------------------0) Rename your LibO user profile folder, to make sure that there is no influence of any special settings on the test (I always do so before such tests).1) Start LibreOffice; -> the Start Center window appears.2) Select "LibreOffice > Preferences..." from the menu; -> the "Options" dialog window appears.3) In the list at the left side of the window, click on any top-level entry -- I mean, one of the entries "Load/Save", "Language Settings", "LibreOffice Base", "Charts", "Internet", which can be unfolded to show the sub-entries. -> Most times LibreOffice will crash now; if not, click on another top-level entry. It _may_ be necessary that the top-level entry is not unfolded, but closed before you click on it.Sorry, this is my big problem: I have never managed to reproduce these crashes with the OS's own accessibility tools only; strange (maybe this depends on the Mac OS version? most reports mention Mac OS X 10.7). But I can reproduce the same crashes as reported by the users when I install some window-management utility like Moom, Cinch, RightZoom, ShiftIt, BetterSnapTool ... which all rely on accessibility features.For the tests given above, I have used RightZoom. What I did:1) Download it, e.g. from2) Install it.3) Start the application "RightZoom".4) In the 2nd tab "Applications", select "Enable RightZoom in all applications".5) In the 1st tab, check "Activate RightZoom" and click on "Apply".6) Quit the RightZoom application.7) You can now check in the Terminal via "top", if the Daemon (with the same name: RightZoom) is running.z) Later: To remove RightZoom again: start the application; in the 1st tab, check "Activate RightZoom"; click "Apply".I would guess that the best candidate is not "VoiceOver", but "Enable access for assistive devices"; this option is the one which is mentioned in most bug reports.OK, thanks, now I got it to crash, with Right Zoom active.But that was the TDF build of 3.6.1. A self-build of master (built with Clang from Xcode 4.4.1, with debugging information) did not crash, sigh. I will juggle my build tres a bit (I am a bit short on disk space on my Mac) and build a 3.6.1 with the old Xcode 3.2.6 and 10.4 SDK, gcc 4.0, with debugging... that should correspond to the TDF build.(It indeed seems essential to clean out your Library/Application Support/LibreOffice folder between testing different builds of LO for the crash to happen, for some reason.)Anyway, FWIW, for me slot 1 in the backtrace is svx::a11y::AccFrameSelector::LinkStubWindowEventListener(VclSimpleEvent*)+130 (slot 0 is all zeros, as in).I built the 3.6 branch with --enable-debug, and reproduced.This indeed is some kind of lifecycle management issue. It seems that svx::a11y::AccFrameSelector::WindowEventListener() in svx/source/accessibility/AccessibleFrameSelector.cxx (defined with the IMPL_LINK macro) gets called after the AccFrameSelector object in question has been destroyed.Some debugging output:AccFrameSelector::AccFrameSelector() this=0xc584b60AccFrameSelector::AccFrameSelector() this=0xc584de0 <= constructorAccFrameSelector::AccFrameSelector() this=0xc43a0e4AccFrameSelector::AccFrameSelector() this=0xc43a364AccFrameSelector::AccFrameSelector() this=0xc43a5e4AccFrameSelector::AccFrameSelector() this=0xc43a864AccFrameSelector::AccFrameSelector() this=0xc43aae4AccFrameSelector::WindowEventListener() this=0xc584b60AccFrameSelector::WindowEventListener() this=0xc584de0AccFrameSelector::WindowEventListener() this=0xc43a0e4AccFrameSelector::WindowEventListener() this=0xc43a364AccFrameSelector::WindowEventListener() this=0xc43a5e4AccFrameSelector::WindowEventListener() this=0xc43a864AccFrameSelector::WindowEventListener() this=0xc43aae4AccFrameSelector::~AccFrameSelector() this=0xc584de0 <= destructorAccFrameSelector::~AccFrameSelector() this=0xc584de0 returningAccFrameSelector::~AccFrameSelector() this=0xc43a0e4AccFrameSelector::~AccFrameSelector() this=0xc43a0e4 returningAccFrameSelector::~AccFrameSelector() this=0xc43a364AccFrameSelector::~AccFrameSelector() this=0xc43a364 returningAccFrameSelector::~AccFrameSelector() this=0xc43a5e4AccFrameSelector::~AccFrameSelector() this=0xc43a5e4 returningAccFrameSelector::~AccFrameSelector() this=0xc43a864AccFrameSelector::~AccFrameSelector() this=0xc43a864 returningAccFrameSelector::~AccFrameSelector() this=0xc43aae4AccFrameSelector::~AccFrameSelector() this=0xc43aae4 returningAccFrameSelector::WindowEventListener() this=0xc584b60AccFrameSelector::ProcessWindowEvent() this=0xc584b60AccFrameSelector::WindowEventListener() this=0xc584de0Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.backtrace:#0 0x00000000 in ??

/Users/tml/lo/tdf/desktop/source/app/main.c:33I am a bit clueless about how this LINK stuff works, but will try to see what I can figure out...(It's fun that googling for related stuff, I found some OOo experts calling the LINK mechanism obsolete or old already in 2003...)The problem turned out to be pretty trivial and localized after all. (I am not sure if using valgrind would have helped much, but anyway, valgrind does not work on OS X 10.8, not even a bleeding edge svn version.)The problem is that in the AccFrameSelector destructor RemoveEventListener is called, but only if the mpFrameSel member is non-null. Unfortunately, in the Invalidate() method mpFrameSel is set to zero but the event listener is not removed. So when the object is destructed, as mpFrameSel is null, the event listener does not get removed, but stays active, even if associated with a dead object.The solution is to remove the event listener also in Invalidate(). I added a new tiny function for that.CreatedSuggested patchPushed to master, verifying and cherry-picking appreciated.Tor Lillqvist committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#47368: Remove event listener also in Invalidate()The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.The above patch fixes only the I) case in.For case II, there is an *awful* lot of recursion going on in hitTestRunner(). By an odd coincidence (?), the recursion ends before the thread runs out of stack space though. But then some thirty call stack slots deeper it does, anyway:#0 0x91aa5ef1 in pthread_mutex_lock ()#1 0x000068f9 in osl_acquireMutex (Mutex=0x787e6e0) at /Users/tml/lo/tdf/sal/osl/unx/mutex.c:123#2

stops... Or maybe gdb gets totally confused by something.)Anyway,(gdb) p $esp$7 = (void *) 0xbf7ffff0and the stack bottom is at 0xbf800000:Stack bf800000-bf96d000 [ 1460K] rw-/rwx SM=COW thread 0Running gdb on the TDF build of 3.6.1, getting a backtrace through all the levels of hitTestRunner recursion is a lot faster (as there is no debugging info, it doesn't have any parameter values or source file locations to print out). It took only some tens of seconds, and around 58000 stack levels up it is out of the recursion;) So gdb does not seem to be confused, there really *is* an unbelievable amount of recursion going on here... Well, even if gdb is not confused, *I* certainly am.Ah, sorry, I am an idiot, of course there is no odd coincidence going on, the recursion has not ended, it just happens to be relatively deep in a call from hitTestRunner() when it runs out of stack. So the real problem is indeed to figure out why the recursion is infinite.(In reply to)couldbe related ?Perhaps, but by itself that change does not help.I tried various ways in hitTestRunner() to figure out if the recursion is going to be infinite, but without success. Of course, I have no clue what this code actually is doing... but clearly in some way it thinks that it is recursing down into children but in fact it isn't, it's all the time staying at the same "level". Or something. Sigh.Actually it is not a good thing at all that we have this one bug report for several unrelated crashes (with the only relation being that they happen only if some accessibility tool is turned on). After all, we don't bundle all other crashes into one bug report "crashes when accessibility tools are not enabled" either, do we?The bug described by case I) inis now fixed (in master), to tbe best of my understanding. But case II) is not. No idea about all the other unrelated crashes that this bug might be about.Yes, something seems to be going wrong here, that can't be handled that way as Tor explained, currently it's very difficult to keep overview what problems already have been fixed for what versions and what other ones still are waiting for a fix.IMHO we should- Make this one (or a different one) a Task bug for tracking these problems- Leave those DUPs what have only a very general description "crashes when accessibility enabled " as DUPS of the task bug- Change many oft the other DUPs what have a detailed description concerning the roots of the crashes from "DUP of" to "Blocks Task Bug", so that we have a separate Bug report for each bug causing such a crash.I have too few knowledge concerning details so that I can't do the job.Tor Lillqvist committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-3-6":fdo#47368: Remove event listener also in Invalidate()It will be available in LibreOffice 3.6.2.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.nice work Tor - sorry for the confused bug; we had a lot of a11y related issues stacked on top of each other here I guess. I pushed the patch to -3-6; I wonder if fixing case II nails the rest of these ;-) I suspect this may be the bug that never dies. Nevertheless if we can fix case II, then I guess we can keep this closed and re-assess duplicates as/when they get re-opened vs. more recent versions.Createdpotential infinite recursion fix (?)I couldn't correlate your line-numbers with mine; but if the recursion happens in the first hitTest - then it's possible that if the getAccessibleAtPoint returns the same AccessibleContext as the one we're passed we'll hit an infinite loop. Any chance of testing the attached ? :-)Createda new patchFirst of all: *** Many many thanks to Tor *** *** for his great debugging work! *** *******************************(In reply to)You are completey right. This problem (the confused bug report) has historical reasons: at the beginning, simple-minded QA volunteers like me thought that we really had only one bug with some duplicates; as time went by, we realized that more than one bug was involved, maybe a complete rat nest of bugs, but it was already so common to mark all Mac accesibility related issues as duplicates of this bug that no one wanted to change this procedure ...IIRC many of the Mac accesibility bug reports show similar stack traces, therefore I still hope that we donât have 30 or more different Mac accesibility related bugs, but a small number of bugs, each of them with many duplicates.But to find out about this, and to make it easier to fix the remaining issues, it seems necessary that we QA folks follow Rainerâs suggestion:(In reply to)Having already spent much time with all these different Mac accesibility related issues, and therefore knowing most of them,I can take this job, ifa) I get some approval to do so (we should not have two people do the same job at the same time ;-), andb) we are willing to wait some days -- browsing all the related bug reports and sorting them will take quite some time ...Should I begin?Michael Meeks committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#47368: Fix for infinite recursionThe patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

If not, I could also send you the new versions of the two .dylib files in question that you could replace the ones inside the TDF 3.6.1 .app with to test... (Assuming that works.)Agreed - many thanks to Tor ! :-)The fixes should be in 3.6.2rc1 which is just coming up for freeze, and then (IIRC) we should have 2x weeks to nail down exactly which of these we did in fact fix - and split the rest out of this bug.I'd rather like to mark it fixed however at this point :-)(In reply to)Thank you for the answer! OK, I will take it ...Thank you for your offer! But luckily, we have Mac daily builds of the 3.6 branch at-- so no library replacement is necessary.I want to share some GOOD NEWS with you:Testing our LibreOffice 3.6 daily builds, I can still reproduce both issues, I and II (see), with LibreOffice 3.6.2.0+ (Build ID: cfbfa26) Pull time: 2012-09-07 10:35:10But I can NOT reproduce them anymore, at least not by the easy steps listed in, with LibreOffice 3.6.2.0+ (Build ID: c303961) Pull time: 2012-09-11 08:49:57This is the first daily build which includes Tor's and Michael's fixes (seeand). This means very probably that the roots of both crashes I and II have been really fixed, once and forever.So: thank you very much again, Tor and Michael!More good news:While I am still sorting all the possibly related issues (cf.,; please be patient, I will upcome with a comprehensive and well-sorted list soon!), I can already say that many of these issues are so similar to our test cases I and II, that there are good chances that many of them have been fixed, too, by these two patches.Roman - that -is- great news :-) I'm going to close this FIXED then until further notice; any new a11y bugs we should split out into their own new trackers :-)Many thanks for testing & for all who reported bugs, and helped to find a solution - much appreciated !***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***A little update:I have to ask you all for some patience. Since 3 days, I am sorting and testing all known bugs which are (or could be) related to Mac OS accessibility features. It will take me some more days to complete this survey, because I need to test every bug with at least 4 different LibO builds, and often the steps to reproduce a bug are not very easy to understand. I am leaving a detailed comment about my results in every bug report, so you can see which bugs have already been revisited.My plan is (simplified!):* Every bug which was reproducible with LibO 3.6.1 and LOdev master BEFORE Torâs and Michaelâs two patches (which fixed the two issues listed here in), but is NOT reproducible anymore AFTER these patches have been applied, should stay marked as a duplicate of the present bug; because if it was fixed by the same patches, it had the same roots.* Every bug which is still reproducible AFTER these two patches have been applied will be reopened. If some of them are related to each other, I will to try to group them by marking them as duplicates of each other, etc.* Other bugs (which I canât reproduce or are very unclear) will be reopened or set to NEEDINFO, depending on the specific bug situation.* After completing my survey, I will create a new task bug -- this time a real straightforward task bug, similar to our MAB bugs --, to which I will add as âDepends onâ all remaining issues, so that we can easily track them down.(I will NOT use the present bug report as task bug, because it is already far too long and confused.)The idea is to find out which bugs are related and which are not, so that at the end we will NOT have yet another confused task bug with 30 or so singular bugs in the "Depends on field", but a simple and clean task bug which only lists (hopefully) 5 or 6 remaining issues, all well-sorted and well-documented.If you want to discuss about this, please write to me directly at, or discuss this on the QA mailing list. The present bug report, already far too long, is IMHO not a good place to do so ;-)So, again: please be patient.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***CreatedHTML document: âResults of a survey of all LibreOffice bug reports related to Mac OS X accessibility featuresâResults of a survey of all known LibreOffice bug reportsrelated to Mac OS X accessibility features--------------------------------------------------------Attached to this comment you will find a detailed summary of my test results (document in HTML format).

id=46447	Since several versions, and also in previously used openoffice versions, and at least for all 3.x versions I had, the presentation module Impress shows the following bug which completely ruins any given presentation. This bug occurs on a regular basis - usually once every presentation I generate:For no specific reason, suddenly, images which have been embedded (not linked) into a presentation 'disappeare' with only a 'missing-link' placeholder displayed instead of the image in the editing mode of Impress.Once this behavior occurs, the presentation is irreversibly damaged and is in a state of unpredictable behavior.In particular, the obvious first choice for a fix, namely to simply delete the missing links and re-embed the images regularly leads to chaotic and additional disappearance of more images in the presentation.A minimalistic example of such a presentation, showing only one missing image is attached.The unpacked ODP files of such presentations always display the same pattern regarding this issue:In the unpacked file noLinkErr.odp without the bugand in the directory 'Pictures' one finds the relevant image "10000000000001F4000001F0BC3B6675.gif" in the present case,while in the XML file content.xml one finds a markup which links to that image<draw:image xlink:href="Pictures/10000000000001F4000001F0BC3B6675.gif" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="embed" xlink:actuate="onLoad">In the unpacked file LinkErr.odp with the bugthe relevant image is missing in the directory 'Pictures'and in the XML File content.xml the markup which should link to the image reads only<draw:image xlink:href="">For me the only way to 'avoid' this error is to keep a long list of incrementally saved backup versions of any presentation I generate - which is very awkward.wbwb CreatedOriginal presentation and presentation with disappeared image and corrupted ODP fileI believe Thorsten did some work on things like this in 3.5.x can you confirm the problem continues there ? [ and sorry for the horrors here ! ]Observed the exact same problem in 3.5.0rc3.(In reply to)Hi Michael,At a guess, I'd say the problem isn't entirely solved :and I'm still losing images from my own Writer business template documents in 3.5.1.2 and Norbert's daily build from 23/03/2012 (#fdo 33393).AlexThis bug is pretty annoying. I'm currently preparing a presentation and I keep losing and replacing images at least 5 times per day :(. I'm using the LibreOffice version 3.6.2.2 from Ubuntu 12.10. Is there some kind of workaround or fix that reduces the impact of that problem?Also, I think that users should be warned when including images. I've got the habit of deleting figures after embedding, since I expect them to be stored in a document safely. Not being warned about Libre/Openoffice's bad memory can destroy hours of work.@Peter WÃ¼rtzWelcome to the club.Impress simply is not (and never has been) a top priority on (Ooo)Libreoffice developers' list if it comes to bugs. That is very Very VERY sad, and I think it is a BIG mistake.This way Libreoffice will always remain a niche-product for all of those parts of academia and business where professional presentations influence not only careers but many other things on an every-day basis.Yet, that's how open source development works, namely by how many people 'make noise' to ask for resolution of what bugs.Sad enough there are simply zillions of more users out there who need Libreoffice just as an MSWord/MSExcel replacement rather than as a Powerpoint or KeyNote or MathEditor replacement. So there is just much too little traffic on all those nasty bugs in Impress, and hence too little 'persuasion' for the developers ... even if the bugs are as *absolutely* *devastating* as this bug here.Just for the record: another very 'nice' example of this situation has been Bug 48179 (still Ooo). Check it out. That one was just unbelievable - but, counted together with its duplicates - it has taken more than *7* years to get at least a 'workaround' embedded into Ooo's code base.To summarize, I fear this bug will still be around for a long time ... unless you find some >200 people constantly knocking the door.Just to get it wright by the previously mentioned 'Bug 48179' we meanand not the link which the previous comment produces automatically ;)(In reply to)No Idea what you want to tell with this comment and that linkI see this one more critical than major, nobody can risk to use LibO Impress if he has to be afraid that he will stand in front of audience with a damaged audience. I will nominate this one as HardHack on <>Modified OS due to ALL because reproduced with WIN (see <>!)CreatedValidation ResultsFor reporter's original Sample documentCreatedSample document in valid ODF 1.2for further testsStill happens in 3.6.4.3 ...I see this bug is already reproduced multiple times. Therefore I mark this as NEW. Rainer already set the priority, so nothing to change there.Kind regards,JorenPresent in 4.0 as well, Windows and Linux.I have the same problem. Problem can not be replicated all the time, but when it happens images from Picture folder (in odp archive) disappear, and content.xml shows only "" for href (empty string). Sometimes even OLE objects would disappear and folder Object 1/2/3... will be removed.This bug still occurs in version 4.0.1.2 on Mac OSX and is VERY, VERY annoying.I once a week stand in front of my students displaying slides where some images got lost. This is very embarrassing.This bug drives me crazy, and it will stop me from using Libreoffice very soon.It seems that increasing the memory for images in the options dialog (say from 30 MB to 200 MB) reduces the problem. Nevertheless, the current situation is hardly acceptable.Any chance to get an at least passably reliable test kit?(In reply to)>Seconded - it might easily save me days. Ideally a "do this, do that, and with image cache set to 1k, it happens every time".Try this to see if it helps:1. Copy the slides.2. Paste them on a new empty ODP.As far as I know corruptions tend to happen when we work on old ODPs (probably created by an earlier version of OO or LO) as a template. The above method solve my teachers problem of currupted ODP. Side effect, the new ODP became much smaller (about 10% of the original). Obviously there was a lot of rubbish in the old one.Tedo Vrbanec, please consider:<>If you also did this mistake in other Bugs please undo your Version changes there!And do not do such changes without any comment!(In reply to)I believe he was just trying to say that the bug still exist on 4.0.2.1 rc. I used to think that's how it should be too.Tedo, to do this, better to add a comment like "Still present in 4.0.2.1 rc."Cheers!Yes, my mistake. I apologize.Still present in 4.0.2.1 rc.This has also happened to me, multiple times:- OS X, 10.7.5- Version 4.0.1.2 (Build ID: 84102822e3d61eb989ddd325abf1ac077904985)TinderBox: MacOSX TDF Release, Branch:libreoffice-4-0, Time: 2013-02-27_17:15:43I can't replicate this bug using the noErr attachments fromand. Tested by opening numerous times and re-saving and re-opening using v3.5.7.2 under Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 and v4.0.2.2 under Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 and Win7HP. The graphic always displays.This bug is absolutely a show stopper.I stand several times in a week in front of my students with slides where images disappeared. I then have to open my script where the images do not disappear.This is really embarrassing. How can I convince the students like this from using an open source product?I can not understand why such a bug is not critical. Loosing data is even worse than a blocker.It is sure a memory management bug. But with 16 GB I have enough!!I pay the guy that fixes this bug 100 USD!I can send you an example ODP where you can reproduce the bug in 5 minutes.(In reply to)I tried it too with LO 3.6.6 on Win7 and was unable to replicate it as well.I opened noLinkErr.odp, save as another file. Closed LO. Reopen the file. Image is there.I created a new page, copied and pasted the image there. Save. Exit. Reopen, and both images are there.I duplicated both slides. So, now 4 slides with the image. Repeat as above. All images in 4 slides appears.I also resized and moved one image. Same.I've been using Impress quite heavily recently, and have not encountered such a situation before.I also played around with LinkErr.odp. It's as decribed, but I've no trouble adding the same image into it and still have it after reopening it.Sorry. No bug in sight.Finally, after many months of waiting, LO4.0.2 and LO4.3 no longer loses images from the presentation (Debian Wheezy).(In reply to)@Marcus: can you still reproduce this using LibreOffice 4.0.3.3? Followingandit isn't reproducible anymore?Kind regards,Joren(In reply to)So, case closed?(In reply to)It looks like the problem is gone. Thanks a lot!Thanks for the feedback!Lets mark it as RESOLVED FIXED then, although we don't know which commit fixed this issue we can be sure something fixed this behavior (thanks to the many confirmations).Kind regards,JorenPS: there are more NEW and UNCONFIRMED bugs out to (re)test. Feel free to help!This is by no means fixed. I had to give a talk today, and everything was fine when I double-checked half an hour before. So I saved the presentation (LO 4.0.3.1), shut down the laptop, and went to the lecture room. When I started the presentation much to my (unpleasant) surprise, two animated images on the second slide appeared empty with the infamous symbol in the upper left corner. This continued throughout the talk, and (if I am not mistaken) not only for images which were inserted by copy-and-paste. I consider this a showstopper.Windows 4.0.3.3 appears to be okay with some light testing using a new document with various images (saving, closing, re-opening, repeat) as well as old ones that had problems in the past. Will check Linux shortly. I don't think this should be closed as quickly as it was, as a Professor I gave up on using Impress long ago as it was not stable enough for normal use. Many people are probably in the same boat as I am and have resorted to other alternatives, so the pool of people actively testing this now will be smaller.(In reply to)Thank you for providing the details of how it happened.Some questions for you:Were to 2 animated images linked or embedded?Can you replicate the problem?Can you provide the file (or part of it, in which the problem can be replicated) for others to test?LO 4.0.3.3. The bug still exists in writer!!!!!!!! I replace the pictures every time I close and open document. A few days ago something happened and pictures were in the document for good, but I had to chenge the pictures and the problem is here again!!! I change status, becaus it drives me crazy.Ah.. to reproduce just prepare any drawing in Draw and place it in the document in writer. For 100% sure it will disapear add title for teh drawing.Hi @Piotr and @Bringfried Stecklum, one user reported that the bug only exists in files created with older versions of LibreOffice (some sort of old file structure that is not overwritten). If you open a new document and import your old files does it still have a problem.I have been giving lectures with LibreOffice for a couple of years, and this last semester I had no problems. Every time I reuse an old lecture, I open a template that I use and import the old slides in to avoid the above problem. Any way I am curious if it works.(In reply to)I can appreciate your frustrations, Piotr. Same for others experiencing this. I'd be frustrated too if I were you. I thought this bug report is for Impress, not Writer. Yet, perhaps both issues may be based on the same root cause. Besides, similar issues has been reported for Calc (). So, this appears to be a FILESAVE issue, specifically in graphic handling.Anyway, I've just done this: create a square with Draw, copy and paste it in Writer, and Impress. Reopen both files and find them still there.I'm using 3.6.6 (having experienced some issues with LO4). Perhaps affected ones can consider using this version instead. I plan to return to version 4 only when 4.0.4 release is ready.Perhaps in same cases the matter is as suggest by Vossman (), that it's an issue of backward compatibility. His method may solve the matter for some of you.Btw, Piotr, UNCONFIRMED means that "Nobody has confirmed that this bug is valid." It seems pretty confirmed for you. SeeCreatedtest_file_missing_pictureI enclose the file with missing picture. I think it is related to picture title. Without title I was able to keep picture inside the document.Reproduction:1) Paste special picture from draw as "Picture Format"2) save writer file3) open file again (the picture is still visible)4) add title to the picture5) save and close the writer document6) open the writer document - picture is missing.

Everything worked just fine until this morning. I think the program just knew that today is my deadline ... when I opened up the file: all links broken, no images displayed anymore.I noticed on funny thing: In the "missing file frame", the link was pointing to the some target e.g.:file:///D:/Dokumente/Dokumente/Report_Phase1/Figures/CSEM/image.pngAt a first glance this looked OK, but looking closer I noticed the "Dokumente/Dokumente", which is incorrect. In fact, the true path should have been something like:file:///D:/Dokumente/Report_Phase1/Figures/CSEM/image.pngTRACKING DOWN THE PROBLEM=========================I opened a new file (odp) and copied one slide containing a broken image link from the original presentation to the new test file. On a second slide I used the dialog (Insert -> Picture -> from File) to again link to that same image.I then saved the presentation and re-opened it with the result that the link on the first page was still broken, but the second link worked just fine. I then unzipped the odp-file and took a look at the content.xml file. The two links looked as follows:../../../../Dokumente/Report_Phase1/Figures/CSEM/image.png (broken link)../Figures/CSEM/image.png (new working link).NOTE: the actual paths were much longer, I have shortened them a bit for this post.BUG FIX=======I used "find & replace" (../../../../Dokumente/Report_Phase1/Figures -> ../Figures) to replace the incorrect links in the content.xml file and re-integrated this file into the unzipped odp-file ... problem solved.OK, neither do I know, if this bug fully relates to the ones described above nor do I don't know, why Impress is doing this to us, but at least I found a way to fix this problem for me.Hope this is helpful to track down the problem, because this is REALLY annoying.CheersSebastianCreatedXDOC test case -- before bugVersion from before this bug hit Jared againCreatedXDOC test case -- after bugI just attached two files, xdoc test case "before bug" and "after bug". I just hit this on Windows 7 using LibreOffice 4.0.4.2.The "before bug" file works great and has lots of images. Suddenly, as I was editing my slides, many pictures disappeared, including the airplane on slide 1, 27, and 31. Also many pictures disappeared on slide 29.The *after bug* file was saved immediately after the bug struck. I don't know what I was doing. I think I was perhaps editing the text near slide 37.I have been dealing with this bug for years. I often create very image-intensive slides. I can distinctly remember three previous presentations where one particular image continually disappeared. It would be *wonderful* if someone can figure out why this is happening and fix it.(In reply to)Thanks Marc. On a second (n-th) thought, I agree with you that #11 is not linkedHi Sebastian,(In reply to)Thanks for the clear description and (sort of) solution.I don't think that it is the same problem as in this bug.Here, the embeded images really get lost.In your problem, the links are corrupted. Your problem looks very much related to, where the problem also is that path file:///X/more is changed to file:///X/X/moreMaybe you can open a separate issue and refer to 48463 ?Regards,CorHi all,So good news is that there is some work goning on to fundamentaly repair the handling of images.For time being ....It would be my advise: if you cut and past images from one place to another in the presentation: - keep a copy of the presentation before starting that work; - use a separate Impress/Draw document that you paste the images in; - when all collected, sorted out: - save the presentation - copy the images from the other file to the presentation - save againIt's some extra work, but compared to other work, let alone losing a file, relatively little.Ciao,CorI had the same problem in LibreOffice 3.6 with a png picture.Finally found a workaround that seems to work fine:- Add the picture to your presentation (the first time it is correctly displayed)- Select the picture in the presentation- Cut the picture into the copy & paste buffer (CTRL-X)- Paste the picture again but as GDI metafile (Shift CTRL-V)- DoneAfter this format change, I did not loose my pictures again.Hope it works also for you.diback394I still experience the problem it in LO 4.1.2.3 Build ID: 410m0(Build:3)(Kubuntu 13.10)Being bitten by this on LibreOffice 3.6.7.2 (Build ID: 3.6.7.2-4.fc18) (png images only?)works well as workaround.Thanks diback394This bug embarrassed me this evening at a presentation I was giving to a Cambridge-based society of software developers.Ironically, the talk was exploring the benefits of Open Source and how it is becoming an option for UK Government.Needless to say, this didn't set a great impression for LibreOffice nor for Open Source in general when some images failed to load!Affects: LibreOffice Impress 4.1.4.2, on Ubuntu 12.04.(In reply to)Since this workaround is confirmed to work, can I request all who are affected by this to confirm if in your situation the affected images are in PNG?Workaround worked, images were PNG. Version 4.0.2.2 (Build ID: 400m0(Build:2))I'm seeing this same behavior in v4.2.0.4 of Draw (on Mac). It has really killed broad-based adoption of LO in our organization. The latest update is to use the workaround, and from here on out, I will, but what is the current status of any fix?Having a large presentation due recently, I struggled with this issue on my Fedora Linux 19's LibreOffice 4.1.5.3. Just opening up the presentation, making a small change to some text, saving it and closing it will often result in lost images the next time it is opened.I have also opened Fedora bug 1084822. <>I noticed this bug first after an update to LO 4.2.4.2 on Fedora 20.For me the workaround intdoes not work (at least for JPG files). After reinserting the image is reset to 100% and the displayed zoom factor does not change when the frame is drawn smaller. This may be another bug but I did not verify this yet.I still have this bug.What is more, it seems to be worse in the latestlibreoffice-core.x86_64 1:4.2.5.2-1.fc20than with libreoffice-core.x86_64 1:4.1.3.2-9.fc20 will be updatedI'm downgrading...LO Impress 4.2.5.2 (official RPMs from LO website) on ~AMD64 Gentoo. PNGs were inserted via Insert -> Image form file. After one of saves (could be also autosave), some of images are gone and their XML nodes contain empty href attributes. No "copy & paste" was used.Same issue on Win 7 and LibreOffice 4.2.5.2, with SVG and PDF graphics inserted using the "insert image from file" button, or using a copy-paste from Inkscape.After some changes in other slides, the href in content.xml file becomes blank for some (apparently) random images: <draw:image xlink:href="">.My father just struck this in LibreOffice 4.2.5.2 (official x86 build) on Windows 7. The installation is pretty much out-of-the-box defaults.The machine:- AMD Turion X2 2GHz- 8GB RAM- Windows 7 Professional 64-bit- Other applications installed/running: - Kaspersky Internet Security - Mozilla Firefox - Mozilla Thunderbird - OwnCloud sync clientUp until tonight I had good faith in LibreOffice. It took a beating tonight.The presentation was created from scratch in LibreOffice, saved as OpenDocument presentation format.Only the stock template was used, the presentation itself consisted of a small amount of text, and about 17 JPEG photos, each approxmately ~4.7MB in size (3648x2736px). An image would be inserted (embedded) into the presentation, one by one, then resized and positioned on the slide. No special styling has been applied to any object other than the resizing of images. No transitions.Up until this point, no image loss had been observed. The file was growing to about 60MB in size.He decided to start compressing these images to reduce the size a little as the size of the file was beginning to have an impact on performance. After doing this, he got the file size down to 27MB, then noticed some photos had gone missing. Photos would randomly disappear from the document, re-adding them would cause others to disappear.Viewing the presentation would result in the presentation software crashing. LibreOffice would just disappear, we have no crash dump.We've just tried downdating to version 4.1.6 (obtained from).We observe that when we view the slide sorter, sometimes the images appear missing, then viewing that slide, the images would be slow to display. (They'd take about 20 seconds.) After viewing the presentation, then returning to the slide sorter, the preview of one slide still shows missing images.I'm running Fedora 20, and also getting this bug with libreoffice-4.2.5.2-1.fc20.x86_64.This bug is marked NEEDINFO. What info is needed?***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***I would like to add an observation that could narrow things down slightly. This seems true for version libreoffice-4.2.5.2-1.fc20.x86_64 in Fedora Linux (I'm not sure if it applies to other cases). For me, this issue seems very much related to autosave.I've been working with a large presentation ~100 slides, lots of videos, pictures, shapes, animations, etc. Total size is about 200MB. I was getting the missing picture problem somewhere in the document every time I worked on it.I've noticed that if I worked on the document for a short time, save it, and quit, I wouldn't see the problem. I've turned off autosave, and haven't seen the issue since. For me, at least, it seems that regular save -- ctrl-s, or from the file menu -- don't corrupt the document. Only a save after an autosave occurs causes this corruption.How is this bug still unfixed?! It was first reported 2 years and 5 months ago.At my company, a debate is raging over whether we abandon our Microsoft Office 365 licences and go entirely to LibreOffice. Unfortunately, the abundance of bugs and lack of movement in fixing them is the main cited reason why we should stick with MS. It's hard to disagree.Change Version back to 3.3.2 according to:We have actually fixed this in one sense, it's just that there are multiple issues and evidentially we haven't fixed them all and this has now become a catch-all bug for a bunch of bugs with the same result. We definitely have fixed some of them. What is required is a route to reproduce, on the very latest stable releases, for what reportedly remains.Really? That's strange, because it worked in any case I tried in version 4.1.6.2, but causes severe problems almost randomly in version 4.2.5.2 again no matter how the image was embedded (imported or copy&paste) nor if it was edited (cropped, resized, ...) or not.I agree with Mike Brooks, it's almost impossible to migrate our company to LibreOffice since there are such obvious bugs even in the nth stable release.I got the same behavior with a fresh presentation using Version: 4.2.5.2 on Ubuntu 12.04 32bit. Yesterday, I decided to remove all the spaces from the path and even the name of the presentation (just to try!). Up to now, the problem disappeared, but maybe it is just a coincidence and it is not related to the bug.Mat Hirsh, #85, is on the right track.I have used 4.2.5.2 on XP and Win 7 variously to build a large document with many embedded jpegs for then last fortnight. Was driven to distraction by pictures just disappearing.Ready to quit and go back to Office, but following Matt, turned off auto-save. Now two full days on my project without one picture disappearing.This may be the place to look.Since we now have good reports by turning off autosave as a (temporary) workaround, can those still affected by this bug give it a try and report back?(Strangely, I've been working on an ODP with lots of images for years (now 3264kb) w/o this problem.

I'm throwing together a presentation in Impress and I'm using this Google Images file of as a placeholder (Perseid meteor shower)and its disappeared, replaced with an image icon.The presentation is in a subdirectory of my home folder. This image is within an images directory:- 644 my_presentation.odp+ 755 images|-- 644 perseids_bruenjes_big.jpgI've been dealing with this problem by reinserting the missing images and saving immediately. Files saved with all the images visible have been opening with the images visible subsequently. In other words, the images don't bork--for me--when the file is opened.There are multiple bugs that have the same result. This is now a mangled trainwreck of a bug report unfortunately. Some of the problems reported here are certainly solved, and there appears to be remaining problems.Taking *4.3.1.2*, and *ignoring all earlier versions*, is there now a known route to reproduce the problem ? At this point a script to continually inserting/copying/saving images into impress in some mega-loop might be the way to go.I really cannot believe this is happening. This bug is pestering me for years now and left me standing in the rain again yesterday with a part of pictures gone during a presentation. This was a presentation created from scratch, no legacy imports whatsoever. The Powerpoint DVD is spinning in my drive, I'm over and out after 8 years of OOO and LO, I'm using Latex instead of Writer anyway.I agree with some of the comments above: There seems to be little understanding in the community that Impress could be an important "door-opener" at Universities where MS-Licenses are cheap and scientific documents are often written in Latex anyway. We lecturers could be multipliers but - as mentioned before - I feel truly left standing in the rain.As this bug is related to embedded images, a possible way to avoid it is to use linked images.When pictures are linked instead of embedded, it is important to activate option "Save URLs relative to filesystem", as explained at.As a consequence, images are never lost, because they are previously placed in some known folder in order to link them. If the presentation has to be copied or moved to a different folder, images will be available provided that they are copied or moved to the relative corresponding path too.I can confirm this is still happening in 4.3.1.2 and 4.2.6.3. I lost many of my copy/pasted images in my slides more than once in the past 2 weeks. This is really a show-stopper, and I think this is the worst bug currently present in LO that I know of.I am now trying some of the workarounds here presented (increased memory buffer in options + removed the Configurations2 folder from the odp + disabled auto-save) and have not encountered this bug again so far.I also got hosed by this bug. I lost all of my copy/pasted images in my slides more than once. This is a horrible bug for software based on showing images. Hours of time down the drain on this product.

Please fix this a.s.a.p. to prevent more loss of work, emberrasing moments and image damage for LibreOffice.I was using LO 4.2.6.3 (Build ID: 420m0(Build:3)) on Ubuntu 14.04.1 32-bit (up until Monday 29 Sept when I installed Xubuntu 14.04.1) and encountered that problem constantly. As with others, it did not matter how I put the pictures in (Insert; Copy/Paste; Drag/Drop) eventually some of them would disappear. I always 'fixed' it by right-clicking on the empty image box and clicking "Change picture" and basically re-assigning it. This would often cause other pictures in the presentation to disappear.I started encountering another issue with the Slide Pane not being visible but I don't know if that issue belongs here.Since I just reformatted and they weren't working anyway I do not have a sample doc to post but for now I will stick with Google Drive.JerCreatedTest case for images disappearingI just took LO for a quick test spin and attached the file. As you can see, I didn't even get 4 slides completed before the image on my title slide disappeared. The images were saved from Google (Save Image as) to my desktop and then inserted using the image button. I didn't even have a chance to use 'Save as' so maybe there is something with the autosave (mentioned in previous comments)(In reply to Jer from)Thanks for the report. And what if you apply the suggestion at?CreatedTestcase 2; with changes made fromHere is another test presentation. I have applied the changes from(128 MB for LibreOffice; 10 MB per object) and got the same result as before, this time losing the last two pictures that I inserted. At first, the picture was still visible on the slide in the slide pane but not on the outline. Then after scrolling up and down it was gone from both. All of the pictures share the same directory and are .jpg, .png, or .gif; the two that disappeared were jpgs at 100kb and 300kbWhy only 128 MB ? The maximum possible value is 256 MB. Since at least OOo 2.0 the first customization I do when I configure OOo / LO is to set this value to its maximum. And I do not lost pictures inserted in my presentations.Additionally I uncheck the checkbox "Automatically save the document too" because, as all dinosaurs, I am used to hit ctrl+S very often. Best regards. JBFI used 128MB as that has been suggested in previous posts (). Either way I don't think its relevant as the total size of the pictures I embedded into that presentation was only 2.8Mb. So unless LO is increasing the size of my images 50 fold, why should I have any issues? And while I appreciate the suggestion, it is not a solution, merely another workaround (and one that has been suggested for a year and a half;). If LO can not even function with a cache lower than 200MB then why is it adjustable? I certainly can not afford to spend days preparing a presentation with the risk of losing my pictures.It is the graphic cache and pictures are not the only graphics in a presentation.Best regards.

Just yesterday I had this problem occur at least a dozen times in the course of the day.For what it may be worth: I primarily insert images by taking a screenshot, editing it in GiMP, copying a region from GiMP, and then pasting this into Impress.One of the developers commented above that this problem seems to be triggered from various places, and they are hunting these places down. May I just note: When a problem is so recalcitrant that it cannot be fixed over the course of several years, then something is fundamentally broken. Please consider throwing away the existing image-handling code and re-designing it from scratch.As others have pointed out, this is a <i>disastrous</i> error. This flaw alone has cost users uncounted thousands of hours of lost work. This flaw alone is reason for companies to avoid adopting LibreOffice.Hi,I've never had this bug before. But, when upgrading to LO 4.2.x this bug happens several times (impress).It seems that there are a lot of duplicates were raised at this timeThe bug happens in many ways. Coping and pasting from the net, from Xnview, linking object. At a moment all the images inserted disappears. But only images added.The only workaround for me was to save my file very often.I've upgrade to 4.3.2, and this bug seems to have gone away. In the other hand, I've not work a lot with Impress 4.3.2Impress has a lot of bugs since 4.0It' difficult to get the focus on a text frame or on a imageAll these bugs are *regressions*, and are graphic problemsMaybe this bug is a side effect of one of them(In reply to Brad Richards from)for what it's worth, the earliest bug entry I found for this is2002-12-16 11:26:51 UTCThat is about 12 years now, isn't it? - Actually I don't remember running LO/OOo, perhaps even the old StarOffice, without this bug.J.(In reply to Pierre C from)I think that all users should use LO 4.3.2.2. With this release, I have never seen this bug on Debian.@Juang Dse: Please help testing (or developing if you can). LO needs volunteers. Did you tested intensively 4.3.2?(In reply to Rpnpif from)I had write too early.Now I have the same bug but in Writer: an image in a text document disappeared during autosave.Should I open a new bug report or add a sample file to this?As this bug is about Presentation, I opened a new report about writer. Are you OK ?Regards.(In reply to Rpnpif from)I mean that I'll open a new report if it is needed.(In reply to Rpnpif from)Should be this:Wow, given the age of this bug, this is a VERY VERY dissapointing situation, I'm using L.O.Impress, Version: 4.2.6.3Build-ID: 3fd416d4c6db7d3204c17ce57a1d70f6e531ee21 and the problem annoys the hell out of me. I'm just preparing my slides and images come and go when and where they want. Usually the Images tend to stay after loading them again one or a few times... but until no further changes are made it's absolutely unpredictable which images are going to stay or disappear. If people think no-one is interested: I just assume this is a show-stopper that makes people turn away and never come back. I am sure this is not limited to .png, but also happens with .jpeg.(In reply to Pierre C from)Just a little sum up of the situation :I Went to LO 4.2 because working with table and impress 4.1 makes LO crashThen, I went to 4.3 because images disappears in LO 4.2In LO 4.3 I loose some of my work in formulas in writer. None of my update were motivated by a new featureLast but not least : I must keep an OpenOffice, to resized my formulas with borders in writer (borders shrink the formulas since 4.1 ?)This is a really funny way to work and a big waste of timeAnd now, with impress 4.3 It sometimes crashes. Yesterday I loosed one our of work.I'm a ten years user of OpenOffice/LibreOffice. I told many peoples to use this office suite. But since LO 4.x I haven't told anybody to use itSame bug with LO 4.2.5.2 on Windows 7. Memory settings are changed (as suggested above). I use laptop that is not very powerful, can be that there is not enough CPU.Pictures disappear after autosave and after save/save as. Doing backup doesn't help, as pics disappear also from backuped presentations.It's possible to see presentation fine before closing and open it without pictures.Seems that it occurs mostly when you click occasionally on other than current slide when autosave is running. For awhile I continue to see disappeared images in Slide Pane.Pics are disappearing whether they are linked, inserted from file or from screenshot software.It's very very very frustrating. Total loss of working time for me now 48 hours.Many thanks to all, who are working on this problem.(In reply to daria from)Please, read comments of others users above where it is said that all should use LO 4.3.2 to perhaps fix this bug.(In reply to Rpnpif from)Still present, but with a much lower frequency in LO 4.3.2.2 Build ID: fb5295ba211bd31ad47d0bad0118690f76407dWorkaround to prevent embedded pictures disappearing or displaying improperly in Impress slides:1- From "Slide Sorter" right click on empty space and select "New Slide"2- Double click the new slide. Now in "Normal" tab3- Add content to slide including embedding pictures4- When finished with editing the slide Left Click on "Slide Sorter"5- Right click on empty space and select "New Slide"6- File => SaveThe creating a new empty slide at the end of the deck seems to save the embedded pictures placed in the earlier slides.While following this procedure some extra new and empty slides are created.Removing these extra empty slides after saving does not cause deletion/changes of the embedded pictures in the earlier slides.After modifying the contents of a slide, I add an empty slide to the end of the slide deck then File => Save.Since doing this, embedded pictures are displayed properly. Before, only a rectangle with an "x" in the upper left corner displayed rather than the picture. LibreOffice 4.2.6.3Ubuntu 14.14 LTSLinux 3.13.0-34-generic***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***(In reply to teacher1st from)thanks for the explanation teacher1st.This helps because you force synchronisation of the various copies of the document that are kept in memory for the various views (and more).please fix this error ASAP, I've just lost 1/3 of my presentation :'(Seriously, this is absolutely ridiculous. I've been increasingly burned by this bug on while using Version: 4.2.6.3 Build ID: 420m0(Build:3). Finally happened yesterday morning in front of my class. Images from the entire presentation were gone. Luckily, I had an older version of the presentation from an earlier semester that I was at least able to make my way through so that I did not waste a complete lecture period (in addition to the hours of prep work that was indeed lost).I've been trolling this thread for a few weeks hoping a solution would arise. None of the recommendations so far have worked, including that from teacher1st. Images continue to disappear randomly, most often while I am actively creating/editing a file, and sometimes on a fresh open of a complete file.However, I made a new observation today which may be of some value as I have not seen it mentioned in previous comments: I was working on a presentation today which had been copied over as a new file from an earlier version. Several hours in and all of a sudden 3 images are missing from 3 slides, showing only the placeholders, and on one slide an image remains (i.e. on a slide where previously there were two images, there is now one image and one placeholder). In order to quickly remedy this situation, I find the earlier version of the presentation in a different file in a different folder. Lo and behold, when I open that file, the exact same 3 images are missing and only those images are missing. That seems very odd to me.Impress is getting worse. yesterday at a work session of the city council, I was using Impress and draw. I had three crashes !

This has never been assigned to a developer. Marking as NEW.The bug in Impress is still present in my LibreOffice (Version: 4.2.6.3 Build ID: 420m0(Build:3) on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, 64-bit)Recently I started working with TexMaths which inserts LaTex-formatted formulae as PNG images into LibreOffice documents (see)These PNG images disappear randomly while working on the document (perhaps it has to do with the autosave, but I am not sure). In the case of TexMaths, the formulae can be brought back by selecting the empty image placeholder and clicking on the TexMaths plugin symbol to bring up the TexMaths dialog again.I have experienced randomly disappearing images in the past (before TexMaths), sometimes only finding out when giving the presentation. Now I realise that this is due to a long standing bug (or bugs).I hope that this serious problem will soon be solved, and I will try to help. It is the type of bug that efficiently chases people away from LibreOffice. Most of these will not file a bug report, but will simply stop using the software.Still happens on linux mint. Just cost me half an hour.Started a fresh presentation and inserted downloaded jpegs and pngs, nothing more. After saving and reopening images were lost.Version 4.2.6.3, Build ID: 420m0(Build:3)This bug is incredibly frustrating and I hope someone is making it urgent. Images disappear even from a file that is not open. Hoping to save myself some work, I saved a duplicate of the file I was working on, and when some images disappeared from the open one, I closed it and opened the copy. It had the same lost images.I am using a Macbook Air, OS X 10.9.5; Libre Office Version: 4.3.2.2Build ID: edfb5295ba211bd31ad47d0bad0118690f76407d.MY WORK AROUNDI posted this earlier and I unsure how well it works in general, but since I started using it, I have had zero problems with missing images.I think the problem is whenever I upgrade there are slight changes to reading the ODF files. So the work around I use is that whenever I want to open up an old file to edit it for a new purpose. I do not open up the file, I create a new file and use the 'Insert' -> 'File...' from the menu bar.As far as a fix, I think the ODF import function should check to see if any media files are not being used before purging them. If you recall the ODF file is a zip file with the media files inside. I do not see why it could not work this way.I am trying to figure out a list of steps to reproduce the issue, when starting on an empty Impress presentation.From what I read above, it might be an issue with memory management of images (see Tools->Options->LibreOffice->Memory). Or the cleanup of deleted images (might remove images that are in use?).I tried to reduce the values there (only 1MB image cache, only 1MB cache per image, remove from memory after only 5 minutes) so that the bug is more likely to happen.I also used this image,(PNG, 1.7MB).I created several slides and copied/pasted the image around those slides.I did not manage to reproduce the error.Could you all please try, by starting on an empty presentation, to create such a small presentation with the aim to get this golden list of steps that reproduce the bug?There must be something that triggers this bug, and we need to find it.(In reply to Simos Xenitellis from)Thanks for your post and encouraging ideas Simos!What I would suggest also: try with a presentation say 4 slides, with most already some graphics, and saved.Open it, ad a new slide two, copy an image from the file manager, paste it, go to the bowser or mail, set you some fresh tea and come back in five minutes or so, and look in Impress.Hi all. It would be lovely to be precise about what we are talking about here.One thing that I would like to make clearer: we only have, as far as I can see, one confirmation that this happens with autosave turned off ().Could anyone else please confirm that they come accross this issue with autosave turned off? ("Tools > Options > Load/Save > Automatically save the document too")If turning off autosave makes it disappear, you are probably looking for. There is activity there that we can look forward to:Thanks everyone.CreatedPrueba .odp saved and if is open do not shows imagesThis is an example file with images but not shows by libreoffice.@Ismael Cedillo & othersI never opened those attachments so far. But I was curious and a surprise: the image can be seen in the presentation! I'm using LO 4.3.3.2 @ Debian.(In reply to Ismael Cedillo from)I think this problem is different. Indeed LO 4.2.6 opens and shows all images without problem, in both modes edition and slideshow. But LO 4.3.5.0.0+ and LO 4.4.0.0.beta1+ does not show the pictures in both modes. In edition mode the pictures appear during a very short time and is replaced by its frame.I filed thefor that.Best regards. JBFI am running Windows 8.1 64-bit.I didn't have this problem in v4.3.4; but I am seeing one variation of this issue in 4.5.0.0.alpha0+: 1. Only some images disappear (not all slides)2. The image can be seen in the "Slides" pane (thumbnails), but not in the main (canvas) pane. The main pane only shows a placeholder. Attaching a screenshot.3.

id=47482	CreatedSXC files created with Password "test" (without quotes) in LO 3.4.5 and L.O. 3.5.1Problem description: Spreadsheets saved from LibreOffice (LO) 3.5.1 release as Openoffice 1.0 (*.sxc) format with a password cannot be reopened with the provided password (password not recognized as correct) in LO 3.5.1 or in LO 3.4.5. When trying to open same file in LO 3.4.4 is reports corrupt or wrong content.sxc format.Steps to reproduce:1. Create a new file (spreadsheet / Calc) or open a previously created password-protected *.sxc file or even *.ods file2. Menu or icon -> Save as3. Choose file type: - Openoffice 1.0 spreadsheet (*.sxc)4. Enable "save with password" (if not yet selected / active)5. Type in the password in both fields when prompted6. Close the file7. Try to open the newly created *.sxc file with the same password used to save it (or to create is in former versions of LO is this is the case)Current behavior:Libreoffice 3.5.1 (and 3.4.5) report "Wrong password, cannot open file" when the correct password is given.Libreoffice 3.4.4 reports corrupt file (wrong content.xml format) when attempting to open the *.sxc file saved with password from LO 3.5.1.See attached files (both created with password "test" (without quotes, lower case) - one with LO 3.4.5 which opens ok on any version, and one with LO 3.5.1 which fails to open in both versions.Expected behavior:File should open when the correct password is given.Platform (if different from the browser):Linux (Mandriva 2010.2) Browser: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0 This bug can result in loss of data if one opens an older password-protected spreadsheet (*.sxc format), makes some changes, then clicks on "save" (it will overwrite original file, and both the original data and modifications will be lost because one will no longer be able to open the encrypted file despite knowing the correct password). Changing importance to "High/Major".Just checked and bug also happens with text files (saving password-protected *.sxw = openoffice 1.0 text file type).Modifying subcomponent from spreadsheet to libreoffice (this is more general bug not particularly related to spreadsheet code). Cannot yet determine specific libreoffice component involved (legacy export filter? encryption?).Just reporting additional finding that may or may not be relevant to this issue:Besides the problem regarding the legacy Openoffice 1.0 formats, backward compatibility is broken for files saved with a password from LO 3.4.5, LO 3.4.6 and 3.5.1 in current ODF format (e.g. *.ods files for example), which can be open fine (with the password) in the newest releases of LO (3.4.5, 3.4.6 and 3.5.1) but NOT in earlier versions of LO 3.4.x, LO 3.3.x or Openoffice (tested 3.3.0). The following error message appears in a pop-up dialog:Read-Error.Format error discovered in the file in sub-document content.xml at 1.0(row,col).OKSo something important has changed from LO 3.4.5 on in the way the ODF and OO files are saved encrypted with a password, which result in (1) loss of backward compatibility of the saved encrypted files with earlier versions of LO; (2) loss of data if one inadvertently saves current work ONLY in the OO 1.0 format with a password (after closing the file data are lost forever because saved file cannot be open either with the newer 3.4.5 and later LO versions or older versions of LO or OO.org).Further investigating this issue in the issues "solved" in 3.4.5, I found some interesting bug reports ("closed") including:Most interesting isfrom the later:I've tested it and found a workaround to current issue:1. Launch LO 3.5.1 (or 3.4.5/3.4.6)2. Tools -> Options -> Load/Save -> General -> ODF Format version -> (change to 1.0/1.1)3. Open password-protected Openoffice 1.0 spreadsheet created in previous versions of LO 3.x or OpenOffice 3.x, or create a brand new one (with a password).4. Modify some data5. Click on save icon (or File -> Save)File is now saved (not prompting for the previously established password).6. Close file7. Try to open the file from any version of LO 3.x or OO 3.x.It now opens fine with the correct password.In summary:1. A decision has been made by the developers to change encryption algorithm (to AES?) which explicitly makes files saved with a password from 3.4.5 and later versions of LO incompatible with older versions of LO or OO.org.2. A workaround has been previously suggested (but apparently not included in the Release Notes or "Known Issues" - Developers, could you do this?) to change ODF version from 1.2 Extended (recommended) to 1.0/1.1 prior to saving ODF files or OO 1.0 files with a password to make them backward compatible with older versions of LO (prior to 3.4.5) or OO.org3. Openoffice 1.0 export filters in 3.4.5, 3.4.6 and 3.5.1 are "unaware" of the update and save the encrypted file with newer encryption method (AES?) but older ODF format (1.0/1.1 ?!) making FILEOPEN impossible for ANY version of LO or OO...Hope this additional enables this bug to be included in the "easy tasks" list... (just kidding?).BTW - I'm NOT a developer, please HELP!!!!Actually LO 3.4.5 and 3.4.6 behave correctly by using SHA1/1K and BlowFish CFB when saving an encrypted ODF file in legacy format (Openoffice 1.0 *.sxc or *.sxw) as is evident by examining the corresponding manifest.xml.However LO 3.5.1 uses SHA256-1k and AES256-cbc to create the password-protected file with the legacy file types, and at the same time is unable to decrypt the very file it just created and encrypted with the newer method. So it behaves in a way that is neither backward-compatible (which would be desirable when saving in "legacy" formats intended to be opened by older versions of OO.org, or when re-saving older files originally created in the past and in use for several months or years without difficulties) nor compatible with the decryption capabilities of the newest LO versions (3.4.5, 3.4.6) besides the very one that created the "locked forever" file...Is there a reliable way to manually decrypt content.xml or the remaining encrypted data from these "corrupted" files? Has LO 3.5.1 actually used the user-provided password to encrypt in a way that cannot be decrypted by the program, or has it actually corrupted the password? If the first is true, then does the program makes some "assumptions" as to the decryption method that should be used for opening these "legacy" formats that prevent it from using the appropriate AES256 / SHA256 methods when trying to reopen the file? Does someone know a way to manually recover the content of these malformed files by typing the correct command line code (e.g. using "openssl enc -d" or something similar, and how to easily obtain the "hex" version of the salt and of the initialization vector, and whatever else is required for successfully recovering them)?Also reproducible in LO 3.5.2.2(ID 281b639-6baa1d3-ef66a77-d866f25-f36d45f )1. New spreadsheet2. Save as -> Openoffice 1.0 spreadsheet (save with password)3. Type in password4. Close file5. Try to open same file in LO 3.5.2.2 (type same password used to save the file in step 3) -> fails with error message "the password is incorrect. File cannot be opened".By inspecting manifest.xml of the *.sxc file created by LO 3.5.2.2 we can see it has used (or supposedly used) the newer encryption method (AES256-cbc / sha256-1k).Switching ODF version from 1.2 extended to 1.0 (in options -. Load/Save) "fixes" the issue. However now ALL files use older ODF spec (even otherwise up-to-date file formats) and "Not using 1.2 extended ODF format can lead to information loss"...Possible fix:Make export filters (?) automatically use SHA1-1K + BLowfish encryption method and/or temporarily switch to ODF Format version 1.0 when saving current file (text/spreadsheet/others?) as openoffice 1.0 format...[=> Less optimal - "teach" LO 3.5.x how to decrypt the "aberrant" openoffice 1.0 files (???) which cannot be opened by LO 3.4.x nor by ApacheOO 3.4.x too (just tested !).]This bug is still present as of 3.6.2.2 (Build ID: 360m1(Build:2)), the standard version of LibreOffice that currently ships with Ubuntu 12.10.I just lost a bunch of files. Please note that this bug affects the SXC format, and it applies to files saved "with password", and then opened with the *same* version of LibreOffice. This is what the original bug description said. Some of the comments above seem to refer to a different bug.To reproduce:* Create a new spreadsheet in LibreOffice* Type "abc" into A1* File -> Save As. Select "OpenOffice 1.0 Spreadsheet (.sxc) as the file format. Select "Save with password". Type a filename and "Save".* When prompted, type "test" as the password (and a second time to confirm).* Close the file and quit LibreOffice.* Start LibreOffice again. Open the file just saved. When prompted, enter "test" as the password. * You get the error message "The password is incorrect. The file cannot be opened."An alternative way to reproduce this bug is:* open an .sxc file saved "with password" with an older version of LibreOffice.* when prompted, enter the password.* the file will open with no problems.* modify the file.* save it (Ctrl-S).* the file will save with no errors.* close the file.* open it again.* when prompted, enter the correct password.* error: "The password is incorrect. The file cannot be opened."It is this latter method by which it is very easy to lose data, because an apparently saved file will overwrite the previous version, but will become unopenable.Question: Why do I want to save files in the SXC format? Answer: I don't, really. I just have some spreadsheets that are up to 10 years old. At some time in the past, SXC was the "standard" format, and I just never changed it until now. Please, please fix this bug. It has been open for over a year, and it has not even been assigned to anyone. Thanks, -- PeterStill reproducible in the latest release (4.0.3.3):1. Create new spreadsheet with LibreOffice Calc;2. Save it with password as Openoffice 1.0 (*.sxc) Spreadsheet;3. Close file;4. Try to reopen saved file;Expected behavior: After typing correct password the file is opened by LibreOffice;Observed behavior: Cannot open file ("wrong password" error even though the same password used to create/save the file is used when trying to open it).Changing Importance to Medium/Normal since probably most users nowadays create files in the newer formats (.odt, .odc, and so on) instead of older OpenOffice 1.0 format (.sxw, .sxc, etc...). Anyway this issue may lead to the loss of data if an older existing password-protected file is opened, modified and then re-saved with current version of LibreOffice since the older file will be overwritten by the new one which can no longer be opened (with or without the correct password).please can you at least add a message on opening password protected sxc's for editing so that it warns the user to save as an ods, or disable saving of sxc's with passwords.Our lovely payroll lady just lost the staff salaries file after an upgrade to LO3.6 ... assuming that it was a one off she got a backup, made the changes again and lost them all again on saving.I am flabbergasted that this bug has remain unfixed for so long, and further that its importance has been downgraded (I'm putting it up to highest/critical). I can't think of a more critical fault than one that permanently(?) loses user's data, other than one that does so in more common circumstances.Using L.O. 4.0.3.3. I have just lost two files because of this fault, and it seems that nobody cares. As things stand, I certainly won't be recommending LibreOffice to anyone given that they care so little for users' data.I have a few old password-protected .sxw files which I opened, edited, and resaved in the same format. Now when I try opening them, I get "The password is incorrect. The file cannot be opened.", and the work-around given inisn't working for me. As I doubt any other existing bug has such critical consequences, it should be given the highest priority so that users with existing inaccessible files can open those files.CreatedSC1 spreadsheet [test]I can open the saved spreadsheet both in OO 1.1 and 4.1.Caolan McNamara committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":Resolves: rhbz#1013844 fdo#47482 encrypted OOo 1.0 docs cannot be reopenedThe patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

id=42745	was written against 3.4.3. When I tested the first fix that was "approved" it did not correct the problem. A subsequent additional change was made that did fix the problem. The secondary problem had something to do with needing to have a second pass to resolve forward reference names. In other words name "b" referenced name "c" and "c" has not been resolved yet. Where possible, changing the names such that all references to other names are reverse in collating sequence instead of forward avoids the problem. In other words, change name "b" to name "d" and the problem is avoided.The notes on 40590 should be helpful.I'm going back to 3.4.3. I cannot understand the poor quality control that exists within the LibreOffice development organization.

The fix was considered too invasive in a review to be cherry-picked to 3-4.*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***This bug has been marked as CLOSED DUPLICATE OF 40590 which in turn says RESOLVED FIXED. The definitions of those words is subject to interpretation. As it turns out, the fix will not be included until at least release 3.5.0. The bug was introduced in 3.4.3. 3.4.2 worked correctly. 3.4.3 created the problem. The fix is now stated as being too invasive to include in 3.4.4 or 3.4.5. Amazing. They broke it in 3.4.3 but the fix is "too invasive" to be implemented until 3.5.0 at the earliest. With this operating philosophy I don't believe that anyone should consider LibreOffice for use in a true production environment if your software maintenance policy embraces the concept of installing incremental fix releases.Seefor more.
id=42553	CreatedProblem with transparency gradientThere is a problem with the 'transparency gradient' (linear, axial, radial, etc) in Impress, when turning to presentation mode. It is a regression from openoffice, but present since the first version of LibreOffice.The best way to see it is the following:1) Make a new slide with black background;2) Draw a shape and fill area with black (so you have a black shape on black background);3) Right click -> Area -> Transparency -> Gradient and choose for instance a linear one;4) Start the diaporama (F5) and wait for the rendering: your black form isn't black anymore !See test files in attachment for illustration...Even if this functionnality can be considered as not essential, this bug can be a big problem, affecting the retro-compatibility with openoffice: for instance, an enterprise using transparency gradient for its logo (made on OpenOffice) is very very annoyed !This bug was reported, but mixed with other problems, in. As it was recently closed, but not completely fixed, I open this one with a specific description. CreatedOther illustration of the problem with transparency gradient.[Reproducible] with "LibreOffice 3.4.4 - WIN7 Home Premium (64bit) German UI [OOO340m1 (Build:402)]" I created a new example from reporter's ones only showing contents related to report.To reproduce the bug simply open "Test_new344.odp", start presentation and compare pictures with "So it looked in Edit mode", you will see strange differences.Related or not? copy /paste as Bitmap also shows strange gradient geometry modifications, but mostly different from those visible in presentation mode@Radek:Please feel free to reassign (or reset Assignee to default) if itâs not your area or if provided information is not sufficient. Please set Status to ASSIGNED if you accept this Bug.CreatedSample DocumentSee@Rainer Bielfeld: I don't understand why you truncated my test file. Moreover, why did you change my title? With my old title 'problems with transparency gradient in presentation mode', every slide of my test file was relevant, especially the first one, which exactly repeat the procedure described in. Please note that the problem is more than just a geometrical one.Maybe you didn't see exactly what the problem is: when you run the first slide of my file in presentation mode, the screen will be black for few seconds, but if you wait a little (the rendering process takes some time), you will see the relevance of this slide !schrieb:Hi,Your document demonstrates various problems with common subject "gradient/transparency", but very different manifestations and roots. As I told you several times when you posted again and again the various elements of your sample document in various reports, it is important to submit different reports for different problems.You are wrong. I see all the problems demonstrated in your documents very clear. Some of the problems have already been fixed in Master some are in the fixing process, only the geometry problem is a new one that hadn't been reported until now. So I stripped away all known problems and left the relevant new one.CURainer@Rainer:Thanks for your answer. I am glad to hear that the problem displayed in the first slide of my test file is already solved :)I was afraid about that because the patch proposed fordon't solve it (it is another problem, which don't involve 'transparency gradient'). Actually, thisis in some way a duplicate of my old, but with a more precise description. Note thatwas considered as a duplicate of, andas a duplicate of, and nowas fixed. Butis not fixed by the patch for, it's a different problem.So my question is: as neithernorsolve the problem described here in(illustrated on the first slide of my initial test file), which bug fixed it in the master branch ?In all cases, the new title about gradient geometry isn't in adequation with my description in...I can also confirm this bug. Along with the one I reported some time ago (#39369), it makes Impress totally unusable for anything more than trivial slides.@Radek:Please feel free to reassign (or reset Assignee to default) if itâs not your area or if provided information is not sufficient.

In edit mode the beams lead to the corners of the shape (not rectangular), in slideshow they are rectangular to each other.Createdgradient bugs still in masterAttached an updated sample document - note that transparency gradient behaves different to std color gradient, and that hw-acceleration on/off affects std color gradient, and *only* that.Seefor a similar, but separated problem.reproduced in 4.0beta1.Interestingly, the square gradient in slideshow mode is rendered by vcl's ImplDrawComplexGradientBut in editing mode it appears to be rendered by something else; odd.Still rather unclear about this; it all seems to work rather nicely except for the 'Square' gradient.The 'Square'-ness of the gradient is rather unclear to me in the drawing-layer impl. [ which I believe is used for the large preview in the gradient dialog ].The thumbnail there however is rendered with the vcl gradient rendering and is indeed square - which is what we see in the presentation mode.Most odd - did the behavior here really change ?Createdfix square gradient renderingI'd love some review / feedback on this: Thorsten ?Thorsten ack'd on IRC; pushed.Michael Meeks committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#42553 - fix square gradient rendering by vcl.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

id=48168	CreatedScreenshots showing Writer running on each of three monitorsI run three monitors arranged horizontally. When I run Writer on theLeft-hand monitor the various menus act properly. When I move the Writermain window to the Center Monitor, the menus appear on the Right-handmonitor and even sub-menus are on the hard left edge of the monitor so theyare placed over each other. When I place the Writer main window on theRight-hand monitor, the menus appear on the left-hand edge of the rightmonitor and are also placed over each other.I would think the problem lies in an assumption, somewhere in the code,that there are, at most, two monitors side by side and menu positioncalculations are being made accordingly. Below are screenshots of theWriter window on the three monitors.System: Ubuntu 11.04 Natty NarwhalWriter LibreOffice 3.5.1.2 Build ID 350m1(Build 102) I can confirm the problem on a Gentoo with a 3 monitor configuration, using open source ATI drivers and very clean monitor configuration done via xrandr (clean == pure RandR protocol, no tricks, no proprietary hacks).I am using libreoffice-3.5.2.2 compiled from sources on Gentoo.The relevant bugreport is here:There is another report of this issue:And also in another distros:***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***I can confirm this bug.

LO worked fine on Ubuntu 11.10.Interestingly, the problem seems to be dependent on the monitor layout configuration I specify in System Settings > Displays. (I have a 1920x1200 monitor connected to my 1600x900 laptop). If my second monitor is configured directly above the laptop monitor such that the two monitors have their left edges aligned then the problem goes away.However, if my second monitor is positioned so its left edge is not aligned with my laptop monitor's left edge then I can't get access to the File, Edit, View, Insert of Format menus (the other menus work fine); and LO crashes soon after I try to access any of the inaccessible menus.A screenshot of this second configuration is available here:In the screenshot, I'm trying to open the File menu.Same problem here. 12.04 64bit, 3.5.3, fglrx 12.3.Same problem here, Catalyst 12.3Just to emphasise: this is, in my opinion, a serious bug. It pretty much renders LO unusable.Given the number of people who have reported this bug, I'm going to go ahead and change the status of this bug from UNCONFIRMED to NEW although I have no idea if I'm following the correct etiquette (I'm not a LO developer, I'm just a user).I just wanted to write again with a more detailed description of the issue I'm experiencing. I'm a little nervous that perhaps we're conflating several different problems into a single bug report; but probably not. So I wanted to describe my situation in as much detail as possible...THE PROBLEM(I'll use Calc as a specific example but similar problems are present in all LibreOffice apps)If I click on the File, Edit, View, Insert or Format menu, the menu does not open. Instead I see the artefact show in this screenshotnear the File menu.If I right-click on any cell in columns A, B, C or D then I see the exactly the same menu problem.After using LibreOffice for a few minutes it usually crashes.MY SETUPLibOffice 3.5.3.2 (ubunturepositories)Ubuntu 12.04 64bit with dual monitors configured as shown in"FIXES" THAT WORK FOR ME (none of which are satisfactory)* If I disable my second monitor then LibreOffice works fine* If I enable both of my monitors and position the 2nd monitor so the left sides of both monitors are aligned and the 2nd monitor is directly above the primary monitor then it works fine.A further update: Uninstalling "libreoffice-gtk" fixes the menu problem for me (but LibreOffice looks rather ugly without GTK+ integration... but at least it works).uninstalling "libreoffice-gtk" also fixes the problem for this guy:I am at least not getting the stability issue, as long as I run my libreoffice on the left screen it works fine.Yes, it is defintely a GTK issue. If you read bugreport on the Gentoo bugzilla (linked in) you will see that launching LO with SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN=gen 'fixes' the issue.I am also rising the importance of this bug, as it really makes LO very hard to use in multihead environments.Is the problem in the next version (3.5.4) solved?***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***(In reply to)Joker.

It's like Calc has no conception of where the lowest row of data is, and dumbly just goes on forever down to row infinity,ATTACHMENTS (two BBEdit files in a zip-compressed folder called "Column selected paste hang bug"): 1) A sample graph from the Mac OS X Terminal app while the beachball was spinning, and 2) the bug report info sent to Apple that comes up when you force quit (both the "Problem Details" and "System Configuration" sections are included.) It does not crash here with 3.4.4 on Linux. It filled the column until the row 1048576. Well, I might have been just lucky.Another question is if this operation makes sense. IMHO, LO should warn before doing such thing.It is a corner case. The operation does not make much sense. Of course, LO should not crash but such bug can't block the release => lovering the priority a bitThis is a feature and not a bug.If you select a range larger than the copied range calc pastes as many times as possible the content into this range.We might need to rethink this feature in future but right now this is not a bug.Good Luck with your LibreOffice where selecting a column becomes an adventure. I've purchased Office for Mac 2011I vote to reopen this "Feature" report.I created a trivial formula in a cell (=A1+B1), copied it, selected the whole column and pasted it. LO hangs 1 core 100% -> after 5min Mem fills up (8Gb) -> System hangsThe mem fillup rate is not linear, it "lingers" a while at 1 to 1.5 Gb and then goes to 80% in 2 minutes or so.This is problematic. I understand the argument for this "do this to a potentially infinite column of this sheet".In these Programs however, pasting something into a column largely means: "Please column, behave this way!". Otherwise I'd recommend to disable pasting into columns, because it is almost never what you want it to do.Even Gnumeric is smart enough to catch this by asking "Do you really want to paste 65535 copies?(y/n)"!And even when I say yes it doesn't die as LO does.As I understand it their infinity is only about 6% of your infinity but, well, at least I can paste into a column without an adrenaline rush.I dare not fiddle with the controls as this is my first bug report here, but please oh please rethink this one.Sysinfo:uname -srvpioLinux 3.2.0-3-amd64 #1 SMP Mon Jul 23 02:45:17 UTC 2012 unknown unknown GNU/Linux(Debian Testing)Package: libreoffice-calcSource: libreofficeVersion: 1:3.5.4+dfsg-2Installed-Size: 23894Maintainer: Debian LibreOffice Maintainers <>Architecture: amd64***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Lost my work by crashing LibreOffice calc.Closing in Gnome does not work, soffice keeps running.Had to kill soffice in the terminal.Steps to reproduce:- type something in A1- type soemthing in A2- select A1..A2- copy- click on column B by accident instead of selecting B1- paste: memory usage rises, program hangs, work lost.Talked to colleagues about this, they also experienced this too many times.They are now using Microsoft Excel, because of this (and also because of the too low maximum amount of columns possible).Mission critical.Fix it or disable it!This is a serious bug that is reproducible in Openoffice, Libreoffice, and Neoffice, on my Macbook Pro, 10.8.5. Basically makes the spreadsheet application of these MS Office alternatives useless.(In reply to)This bug applies equally to rows.It is very likely that a user will mistakenly select an entire row or column when intending to select the first cell in that row or column, thus triggering this bug and potentially losing a lot of work.Just wanted to add that this issue still appears in Version: 4.2.4.2.If a user selects an entire row or column eventually LO will hang and crash as it continues selecting cells into infinity. It is hard to see how this is a feature. We are testing this suite to see if it might be a fit for our company and this is the first real deal breaker we have encountered. Is there any insight into a fix or workaround for this issue?This was closed by one of our most experienced spreadsheet developers (Markus). Please don't reopen it as it currently is.

Would a dialog warning that if you continue it may freeze depending on how many cells were selected/pasted in suffice? Would an autosave immediately before a large paste be better?

id=48775	when i open in writer [extras]=>[literaturdatenbank] (i think in english its something like literature-database?!) writer is crashing without any alert.i did the same from terminal and got this output:terminate called after throwing an instance of 'com::sun::star::loader::CannotActivateFactoryException' Do you talk about "Bibliography database" in "Tools" Menu ?If yes, I don't reproduce it with 3.5 branch on pc Debian x86-64.You may try with 3.4.6 (last version of 3.4) or better, you should give a try to 3.5.2 version.Could you also give more information about your Linux distribution (which one, which version) ?(In reply to)yes i think bibliography database is the right one.i'm using ubuntu 11.10i will take a try to get newer version of libreoffice and will give you a feedback about this.well, i tried to open tools => bibliography database in writer 3.5.1.2 (build id: 350m1 (build: 102)) running on ubuntu precise beta i386 (in vmware) and i had the same problem: crashing writer.ubuntu opened the report-a-bug-dialog and told me it is already reported, but i couldn't find it in launchpad...(In reply to)It seems that Ubuntu does not install base module by default. You should check if this module is installed for you.Best regards. JBFThis is set to NEEDINFO, which additional information is needed?I can reproduce a crash (no error message though); my version is:Version 3.6.1.2 (Build ID: e29a214) (running on Windows 7)I installed only Writer, Calc and Impress (no Base).I assume the best way to fix this is check if Base is installed, and pop up an error that base is needed for the bibliography database if it is not installed.On Debian, if I try to uninstall LibreOffice-base, apt indicates it'll remove all the other LO packages.I took a look toand obviously with a custom install you can unselect BaseRainer: I'm a bit stuck here, any idea?[Reproducible] with LibO 3.5.5.2 Build ID 350m1 (Build:202) on Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit (VirtualBox).I submitted "- CONFIGURATION: UBUNTU offers menu 'Tools - (open) Bibliography Database', although Base not installed by default", and my suspect also is that missing Base Module causes the crash.I am tending to close this one as NOTOURBUG (until proof of the opposite) because i am pretty sure that this bug is Ubuntu only, caused by the particular way of packaging. But of course it would be interesting to see what happens with other Linux Distributions and other OS if Base is not installed. I will try with a Master build.[Reproducible] with parallel installation of Master "LOdev 3.7.0.0.alpha0+ - ENGLISH UI / German Locale [Build ID: 6cad15d]" {tinderbox: @6, pull time 2012-09-03 23:08:07} on German WIN7 Home Premium (64bit)I installed without DB module and now can reproduce the bug, also on Ubuntu 64Bit (VirtualBox) with 3.5.2.Together with "- CONFIGURATION: Menu 'Tools - (open) Bibliography Database', although Base not installed" this one is really annoying. I do not know whether we will have to fix both bugs separately, I can not provoke a crash by simply trying to open an arbitrary .odb(In reply to)While hiding that menu item is IMHO good idea, I think it is not a solution here. Because one can for example write a macro to launch Bibliography Database, something like frame = ThisComponent.CurrentController.Frame serv = createUnoService("com.sun.star.frame.DispatchHelper") serv.executeDispatch(frame,".uno:BibliographyComponent", "", 0, Array())and it will crash as well.It turns out the problem was fixed (see) but for some reason it is reproducible now. I reproduce it with 3.5.4 from Ubuntu 12.04.Bjoern, could you have a look again? Thanks!P.S. I manually removed the files provided by the "libreoffice-base" package and lcl_isBaseAvailable returns true. I have no idea of that, but there is another way to check for Base installed: SvtModuleOptions().IsModuleInstalled(SvtModuleOptions::E_SDATABASE)Still reproducible with Version 3.6.3.2 (Build ID: 58f22d5). I have written a document which has a few includes and one without something in it.I think, first you have to test, if the module exists. If not, give the user a hint, he has to install the database module. If you only hide the button, users will be searching for it, if the have written documents using this and after the upgrade, this button can't be found.The case with scripting will be the same. With a clean errormessage, the user will found out, how the problem could be fixed.Greetings from Switzerland, MarkusStill happens in 4.0.0.0.beta1 (Build ID: 87906242e87d3ddb2ba9827818f2d1416d80cc7)(Win7 x64, lodev base not installed)I also reproduced this on Windows with a Master build.Version field is *oldest* (not newest) version where reproduced.Please put "reproduced in newer version" in a comment, saying exactly which version (for nightly/private builds, give build ID and approx date of last commit/pull).I can reproduce this with 3.6.5.2 on Windows 8. Is it being worked on?Can we get a trace of this ? It is quite possible that we need to get a breakpoint in _exit to see where it is called from; it is entirely possible that we need to run the app then insert a breakpoint into: __cxa_throw, continue and then dump traces for all exceptions until the one that causes the exit - but it'd be good to know where in the code that is coming from.Thanks !(In reply to)I'd like to but after building master sources + "make dev-install", how to disable temporarely Base?I can only contribute my experience with WIN: The only way to get rid of the Bas module (or an other one) is to install LibO with Custom installation and to disable Base during installation. I am pretty sure that that also works for parallel installation. I am also able to disable Base from WIN System Control (Uninstall-Repair-Modify). But I never found a way to do that for a Server installaiton. Theory is that the .msi in the folder with the server installation should be able to do that, but I failed. What ever that might mean for Linux.bfoman: would you have some time to give a try to this bug to retrieve an useful bt?Will check.Created- WinDbg session with FAILED_SOURCE_CODEConfirmed with:LO 4.0.0.3Build ID: own W7 debug buildWindows 7 Professional SP1 64 bitUninstall Base component (if installed). Go to Tools>Bibliography Database - instant crash. Attached full WinDbg session with FAILED_SOURCE_CODE.Personally I don't see this as a MAB as it only happens under very specific situations that only affect a very small number of users (custom install + try to do biblio stuff) but I'll defer to Rainer's judgment....moving to 3.6 MAB so that we can close the 3.5 meta tracker (as 3.5 is no longer being supported).Also marking as NEW as bfoman did his magic and got us a bt :)***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***In master, Bjoern added this nice packagekit hook to allow people to install the 'base' module - which (I guess) mostly fixes the user experience here for Ubuntu.I added a check for an exception on load there; we should silently fail in the case that the database is not installed - better than a crash for sure. Since I can't reproduce, testing is much appreciated ! :-)Thanks for the trace bfoman - very helpful ...Michael Meeks committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#48775 - presumed fix for missing bibliography database exception crash.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

Note that the Ubuntu version (which you are aiming at) actually pops up a session installer dialog and asks for base to be installed.So: Not a Linux bug (as Debian/Ubuntu handle it properly AFIAC and TDF Linux builds have an empty "base" package anyway).(In reply to)Could we have a look at the patch that does that, please?Link (assuming Ubuntu has something like) or attach it here.Quid? TDF GNU/Linux builds don't ship base?Code is upstream and around here:(except that the restart doesnt work and needs to be done manually, but thats not mission critical)It seems TDF build ships everything in core and the base package is a fake empty package.I just tried to reproduce this with Version: 4.2.0.1 / Build ID: 7bf567613a536ded11709b952950c9e8f7181a4a (on Windows 7)This bug should be now avoided since windows installation was changed to automatically install all parts of LibreOffice (including the Base module, which is needed for the bibliography database) (see)I installed 4.2.0.1 over the older version (I think it was 4.1.2.3) and the base module was not installed (no File->New->Database menu entry, crash was reproducible). The bug was however resolved after I deinstalled the older LibreOffice, then reinstalled 4.2.0.1 instead of merely upgrading (Base is then installed).For this reason I'm changing the status from NEEDINFO to NEW since imo either during upgrade setup needs to make sure base is installed even when it wasn't before or to make this explicit in the documentation.OTOH, feel free to close this bug if you feel this bug is now resolved for Windows or you can't reproduce.(This is an automated message.)Setting priority to highest as this is a 4.0 MAB. This is part of an effort to make the importance of MAB reflected in priority too.(In reply to)Closing this one as WORKSFORME then. Forcing to always install all components even on update is an different issue IMHO and should get a new bug then.

id=49120	CreatedA zip file with two sample files - one corrupt and one not corruptI have a file created created in Excel 2010 and saved in XLSX format.If I simply open this file and any minor change (just something to enable the save button) and then save it in LibreOffice the file becomes corrupt.If I open again (after savings and closing) in LibreOffice the row and column headings are not visible and and worksheets are gone.If I open it in Excel it reports the file it corrupt.This is a major issue for us (and I would imagine others?) as it actually appears to completely ruin the file. Not displaying correctly is one thing but we had to halt use of Libre for the time being as this is happening on many computers in our organization.I have attached the file before corruption and after corruption (zipped to one file).I am running Windows 7 64-bit but this ha also happened on Windows XP as well.LibreOffice is version 3.5.2.2 Confirmed with:LOdev 3.5.3rc1+ Build ID: 51648779-22e3d74-d554af7Windows 7 Professional SP1 64 bitAlso confirmed with:LibreOffice 3.5.4.2 Build ID: 350m1(Build:2)Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS 64bitNOT confirmed in LibreOffice 3.6.0.4 (Build ID: 932b512)Windows 7 Starter SP1 32 bitCreatedGlitches after saving and reloadingI tested it with LibreOffice 3.6.1.2 (Build-id: e29a214 on Windows XP 32bit), after saving, the file can be opened but looks corrupt.See screenshot 2012-08-30_09h03m_before_after.png .NB Before I changed anything, I placed the cursor in cell A1. After opening the saved file again, this is what I noticed:- not A1 is shown, but some other part of the sheet- graphical glitches, ie cell numbers dissappearI didn't check to see if all formulas stayed the same.CONFIRMED: Windows 7 64 bit SP1Libre-Office 3.6.1.2 Build: e29a214This issue still occurs as mondane.woodworker also confirmed.Still a big issue as it destroys existing files with no way (that I can see) of getting them back.Confirmed with:LO 3.6.3.1Build ID: f8fce0bWindows XP Professional SP3Graphical glitches after saving and reloading. All sheets are switched from Window>Freeze to Window>Split option. When switched back the graphics is rendered correctly. No data corruption at first sight.Confirmed still bug in v3.6.4 on Windows7 32bitCorrupts save of .xlsx file.

The file is then corrupt.This is extremely serious -I don't know anyone that does not interact with MS Office users at some point - the fact that you have the potential to lose data is a serious problem.CONFIRMED again - LO 4.0.0.3 (release) Windows 7 64-bit.This is a very serious issue.Yes this is a very serious issue - how can we get any attention put on it though?

id=48887	CreatedExample filesWhen you export a document that contains images to a HTML file it embeds the images into the html. That is, it embeds the binary data.I believe that images should instead be saved in a folder with the same name of the document and instead be link to those files. Embedding the images into the html file is a bad idea for two reasons:* It results in the browser having to load a much larger file* It actually results in an overall larger file. In the attachments. In the attachment the 4x4px gif (39 bytes), when embedded, results in an html file that is 86 bytes. When the image is instead link the combine file size of the html file and gif is 61 bytes. 25 bytes is wasted, which will only grow larger as the images used get larger embedding the images in the html should probably be optional.Createdresulting html file and original filePlease also see the attached html file generated with /opt/libreoffice3.6/program/soffice --display :1020 --convert-to html --outdir ./ Untitled\ 2.odtThe embedded image is not show by any browser.I forgot to mention that this was tested in fedora with 3.6.1CreatedODT and example X/HTML output under v3304 and v4132.I think this bug can be RESOLVED as NOTABUG. At the very least this bug would need to be changed to an enhancement request as it is asking for a new option that has never existed. There are separate filters for converting a file opened in Writer to HTML in such a way as to embed or link any included graphics:- File > Export > select File Type of "XHTML" will embed the graphics.- File > Save As... > select File Type of "HTML Document" will link the graphics.These two filters can be used via the command line as:$ soffice --headless --convert-to html:"HTML (StarWriter)" file_to_convert.odt$ soffice --headless --convert-to html:"XHTML Writer File" file_to_convert.odtI have tested this functionality under Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 running:- v3.3.0.4 OOO330m19 Build: 6- v4.1.3.2 Build ID: 70feb7d99726f064edab4605a8ab840c50ec57a... indicating it has always been this way. The problem indicated byis a completely separate issue that is raised (using the same attachment) in.Changed Version to Inherited From OOo as a result of.(In reply to)It would appear that since LO v4.2 the fix tohas made this situation worse as now it is impossible to create a HTML file from any of these sources:- ODT with embedded graphic.- ODT with linked graphic.- HTML with embedded graphic.- HTML with linked graphic.... and produce HTML output (via either quoted method) with a linked graphic. All graphics are written out as base64 embedded. Unsure whether to mark this now as a regression, since the v4.2 change.I agree to Antonio and Owen Genat. It is not any longer possible to create simple html with pictures linked in 4.2Furthermore, and much important, html files with images saved in lo 4.2 writer don't open anymore in lo. lo crashes if you try to do.That means, you can open them in a browser (slowly) but if you wan't to change the code of the html file you must use another text editor.For my opinion, it should be restored as it was until 4.1 and as Owen Genat says:- File > Export > select File Type of "XHTML" will embed the graphics.- File > Save As... > select File Type of "HTML Document" will link the graphics.It is a regression and users complain about it.This one is a killer. It makes using LOweb useless as a simple wysiwyg html editor. Any web page with images is corrupted with filesize expanded by nearly an order of magnitude. That often results in web pages that cause the infamous 'read error' on the image showing pages of 'code' that text and html code editors often complain is a line too long for editing.The fact that there is no obvious work around leaves me high and dry with no options. I finally got a client to upgrade - and boy did I get blown out of the water on this bug.Please disregard myand. I am setting the version back to the earliest 4.2 release due tothrough.

Many browsers don't support it.- It's really a crude hack anyway, as it blows up the data size extremely.Moreover, it breaks any usage scenarios of e.g. using the --convert-to functionality within git for diffs of git managed opendocument files.It's really disturbing that such functionalities are removed in the first place (I thought LibreOffice != GNOME and features would be added, not dropped)... and even more that this is left open for such a long time o.OCheers.LibreOffice 4.2.7.2All the same. I can't use LibreOffice because of this bug.

With this issue, LO is unusable to save to html or create html in Writer Web.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***I was also able to succesfully open the attached file(in 'Example files.zip', named 'embedded.html'), which was posted with the bug in LO Writer 4.4.3.2 I think this bug can be closed?This was caused somewhat unintentionally resolving mail merge features of-- "MAILMERGE: looses embedded image when e-mailing as html"The UX and design side has it under consideration as-- "WRITER WEB: handling of inserted images -- data URI embedding as base64 for email support, broke LO as HTML editor"But, point remains that HTML editing in Writer Web is misbehaving because images are being embedded into the HTML as base64 images by default when saved as HTML (an export filter). Ignoring/overriding settings to link the image.Good for email merge--bad for Writer as an HTML editor.Simple STR:1. create File -> New -> HTML document to launch Writer Web session2. type some text3. insert an image4. verify image is available as a link (Edit -> Links)5. save close6. reopen7. image not available as a link (Edit -> Links), rather is embedded into the HTML as an <img> stanza with base64 encoding.Presently, no way to do anything except embed. Specifically can not link by reference.@Ciorba Edmond, could you perhaps revisit your work on-- where the export to HTML filter actions are now always converting images, without regard for Writer's dual role as an HTML editor. In that mode, Writer does better with a document without embedding the images and so can honor the links.Remains a nuisance into 5.0.0rc2 and current master.In my own experience and as IT support, using Writer as HTML editor is a much more common use case than to mail merging HTML email. If there is not a fix planned for this, we should consider revertingVasily has been working on the HTML exporter.FWIW, some of us do want images embedded when we export to html. Can this be optional?(In reply to Michael Adams from)Please do not adjust details of bug reports, this first occurs in 4.2.0.4--not the current 5.0.1.2 release.In reply to Michael Adams:If you want to RETAIN the embedded image in your document (as distinct from=merely including the link to the image), then:1. From the menu, select "Insert > Image > From File"2. DON'T click the "link" tick-box at the bottom left of the "Insert Image"=dialogue box.The problem here is that (at least in my Version: 4.2.8.2) the embedded image is retained even if you click the "link" tick-box).(In reply to Luke from)I do like the export of images in HTML mail...An option would be great, yes.(In reply to Cor Nouws from)Well sure but the real problem, since default embedding of base64 image into HTML to support for mail merge was implemented, is that we have broken our ability to edit the resulting HTML in Writer Web mode. That default needs to be adjusted--an option on save, or detecting use for mail merge/mail send and only do it then.See the UX-advise(In reply to Leon Arundell from)I'm not 100% sure those two things should be tied together. If you email a file or otherwise send it, you need to ensure the images are embedded. On the other end though, it'd be nice to be able to make an HTML file without embedded images without too much fuss.(In reply to David N. Welton from)They absolutely should NOT. Imagine if by changing the type of link, it changed the export format from doc to docx without notifying the user at save time. This is essentially what Leon is suggesting.These are 2 different types of export formats, standard HTML and non-standard HTML with Data URIs, which is not supported by all browsers. Because Data URIs are non-standard and only useful for email (a very rare use case since all mail clients handle this), if we're going to support them it should be an option at export time. We should never use this format unless the user explicitly requests it, never implicitly tied to the document structure.Until we have the resources to add an option for Data URIs, we should revert commit 5dd1b3da.I'm not sure whether David N. Welton () and Luke () agree or disagree with me.I argue that users should have the OPTION of saving an HTML file with images that are linked (and external to the html file), as distinct from embedded in the html file.My current versions of LO Writer (4.2.8.2 for Ubuntu and 4.4.5.2 fr Windows) do NOT provide this option, even though they offer a non-functional "Link" tick-box when inserting an image from a file.I cannot use 4.2.8.2 to edit an html file with an image greater than about 50k, because once Writer has embedded the image and reopened the file, it displays the image as thousands of ACSII characters rather than as an image. Thankfully this problem has been fixed in 4.4.5.2.Leon Arundell,We all agree with you. With 4.2, we can not longer properly edit HTML files. 4.2 generates non-standard HTML that many browsers do not support. It also changes the structure of the file without the user explicitly asking for it. Finally it introduces bugs like you have encountered.The issue you described is related but needs to be tracked separately. Have you filed a bug report? We should never silently corrupt documents on save. We either need to fix the size restriction or warn users that the images are too large to be embedded.A Writer document saved as HTML is loaded fine with Mozilla Firefox 42.0 but the images do not appear on Internet Explorer 8.0 on am Windows XP machine.Version: 5.1.0.0.alpha1Build-ID: a8e4f75fe264f6ece37c154951cff53f2f4fa3e4Gebietsschema: de-DE (de_DE)IE 8.0 and Windows XP should be no longer supported?Both Dreamweaver CS6 and IE Edge on Windows 10 cannot read Libreoffice 5.2 files saved as HTML, but have no issue with those saved by LO 4.1. We should not be embedding images without the user explicitly requesting it. We should not write non-standard HTML.Should be reverted until this is resolved.(In reply to Luke from)How would you revert it, please? If you read the patch carefully, you will realize that it is not easy. In the last 2.5 years there were so many changes, that we cannot revert to the old code, but it has to be rewritten. Ideally we need to introduce a new html filter option. We have SkipImages and SkipHeaderFooter, probably we should have ImagesAsDataUris option which is not set by default, but the mail merge wizard sets it. Later a UI can be written for the option, if users find this useful. It would have been good to write the original patch like this in the first place, but the student who worked on this was not skilled enough and I did not foresee all of the consequences. Nevertheless mail merge is more important in the enterprise than html editing, so after all the current behaviour is better in my opinion, than it was before.Browsers not rendering data-uri sounds strange [1]. Here with 5.0.3.2 writer uses "image/*" as mimetype, could it be that using * instead of explicit format is confusing other programs? Anyone with IE at hand can double check?[1]Migrating Whiteboard tags to Keywords: (bibisected)I have registered for this forum to agree with Luke. I was using Libre Writer 4.1 and the Save As HTML function worked perfectly with images properly exported as links. I have updated to Libre Writer 5.0.3 and now the Save As HTML function does not export the images. This is a disaster for those of us who use Libre Writer as an HTML web editor. Apparently someone at the Document Foundation is not aware that in Save As HTML, images MUST be separate links. Please please fix this error as soon as possible. In the meantime, I either need to go back to Libre Writer 4.1 or use some other document processing program. The real question is how such a major error could have occurred without someone at the Document Foundation catching it???(In reply to David Spring from)No that is not correct. They are embedded as data URI into the HTML/XHTML by export filter with the "save as". The data URI is read correctly by all current web browsers and most applications. Unfortunately for the 5.0.x release the data URI were not being correctly read back in to LibreOffice. That has been fixed in master (5.2)--but needs to be back ported to 5.0 and 5.1 branches.And? Feel free to simply revert to LibreOffice 4.1.6, from archive here:It will be sorted out eventually.According to whom? Use of data URI (RFC 2397/3986) is perfectly acceptable HTML/XHTML format. Saying otherwise is just FUD.However as noted, there are two valid concerns here. One is that linkage details, as recorded by user preference in the ODF document, are being lost during filter export to HTML/XHTML, and can not be restored on import back into LibreOffice for editing in Writer/Web--loss of data and a legitimate regression.The other facet, is that the use of URL (links: both relative and absolute (RFC 1738/3986) regardless of preferences set per document--is not being honored during export filter to HTML/XHTML, so images are always embedded as data-URI--again a legitimate regression, but just for not honoring a user preference.Nope! That is not the way the project works. Rather see, and follow enhancements for HTML5 and CSS3 suggested in(In reply to David Spring from)The real question is how such a major errorJust to clarify this. There is no one "at the Document Foundation" checking bugs. This is *entirely* dependent on volunteers. If you would like to be a volunteer and test pre-releases out so that we (collectively, as volunteers) catch bugs earlier please feel free to join the QA mailing list or the chat at:I can confirm that Save As HTML is handled correctly in the latest version of Open Office. So this is strictly a problem with LibreOffice. In my opinion, this issue should be raised from Major to Critical. It is not a question of whether web browsers can handle embedded images. It is whether web authors can Save As a (properly formatted) HTML document to work with Sigil in the creation of Epub documents. For the time being, until the developers of LibreOffice can realize the magnitude of this error I will have to tell my students to use Open Office instead of LibreOffice. I am deeply concerned that some members of this forum do not realize what a major -and even critical - problem it is to not have a properly working "Save As HTML document" function.Iâve updated the priority since saving as HTML is a basic feature of any office suite and the triaging documents suggest pairing critical with highest. David, I understand your frustration and agree with you that this is a serious issue. Until this bug is fixed the only way for users to generate proper web pages with their word processor is to use OpenOffice one of the propriety options like MS Word. Unfortunately, Joel is correct in that TDF does not employ any programmers and depends on the community of volunteers to fix issues like this. If you work in academia, maybe someone in the CS department would be interested in working on this. Another option is to start a crowd funding campaign at Freedom Sponsors or Bounty Source. Joel,Would you be willing to bring this up at the next ESC? If not, I will try to.(In reply to David Spring from)Your point?Sorry, but that is clearly *your* use case.As an alternative for anyone similarly concerned, use an appropriate extension and export to ePub directly. The eLAIX project's extension () does quite nicely with complex documents on 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2/master--which I just verified. Also verified that Sigil has few concerns with resulting ePUB, which passes most of the FlightCrew validation tests.You are free to do so. Or work around as above.And?This is not a "forum", this is Bugzilla issue tracker for LibreOffice QA and Development. Opinions, and senseless assertions "the sky is falling" , have little value here. Please refrain.Fully support V Stuart Foote here and just for additional considerations:=---10k open bugs - many have users screaming and yelling about how their bug deserves additional priority. We have an objective way of prioritizing and it's not *at all* intended to dictate to developers what they must fix.Finally, regardless if it's critical or major - it won't necessarily change when/if it's fixed as that will *entirely* depend on a volunteer taking the time to fix it. There is no paid staff, no one dictates what gets fixed, there is no system where users can scream louder to get their pet bugs fixed faster (thankfully as that would destroy the project).As always your options are:1) Fix it yourself (that's what open source is all about);2) Pay for a fix;3) Find a friend, family member, colleague to fix it;4) Wait patiently;5) Use a different product.You seem to have chosen #5, which is entirely fine with everyone :)Here is the code for an Open Office 4 "Save As HTML" linked image. It is identical to the code used by Libre Writer before the change to embedded images with LibreOffice 4.2: <p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.06in"><img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="120" hspace="10" name="Picture 1" src="../Images/ShorelineScribes__6c902d9b.jpg" vspace="14" width="153"/>Here is the HTML code for the exact same image in LibreOffice 5.0.3 "Save As HTML" image which has been exported not as a separate linked file but left inside of the document as an "embedded" image. Keep in mind that this is the code for a single image. Our books typically have more than 100 images. Does anyone on this forum think this is acceptable HTML code for a single image? <p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.06in"><img align="left" alt="" border="0" height="120"

vspace="14" width="153"/>This is why I am forced to recommend Open Office until this HTML coding error in LibreOffice is fixed.(In reply to David Spring from)Sigh... you really are missing the point. No one disputes that there was a wrong turn 54 months ago in implementing an *unconditional* use of data URI (RFC 2397) especially as the Writer import filters were not adjusted to handle that format round trip--making the Writer/Web mode pretty much useless from that point. Import filtering has been restored, but the Writer/Web canvas still needs dev attention to render the markup for the <img src:data... > URIs.But, in point of fact the XSLT based export of ODF documents to XHTML has received prolonged dev attention and provides much better fidelity to the original ODF document than the Writer/Web and HTML export filter has ever achieved.You say your goal is generating ePUB, have you even tested the LibreOffice XSLT export to XHTML as source document for Sigil conversion to ePUB? In that scenario LibreOffice Writer becomes the editing and layout environment--the XSLT conversion generates the fully styled XHTML. Yes the images are embedded base64 there also. But, you would not need normally to tweak the XHTML code directly--but could do so against the XHTML using your markup editor of choice.LibreOffice's XSLT generated markup is XHTML tagged as <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0//EN" ""> DTD, as opposed to the Writer "save-as" filter which retains its mislabeled legacy <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"> DTD. Writer/Web has been a poorly maintained module.This all will get sorted out in some fashion--likely as Andras T. outlined in. Restoring correct handling of the per document embedding of images in the source ODF--and protecting that linkage and file naming during export to HTML. With this issue, andand, as set at appropriate priorities this will be worked out in some fashion. But should note it is entirely possible that in the end we strip out the Writer/Web module as unsupportable while bringing the HTML "save-as" export/import filter more in line with performance/fidelity of the XSLT conversion available in that export module. Ending the illusion of LibreOffice as an HTML code editor.The swhtml filter may even be consolidated with XSLT processing which also could be improved upon. But those are implementation decisions for the dev(s) that elects to take on the task.(In reply to V Stuart Foote from)Sorry, it was just 30 months ago in July 2013, not sure what radix I was thinking in.Thank you for your suggestions. I have tried dozens of options including Export to XHTML and Elaix. I have been building websites and creating Epubs and teaching courses in HTML since the early 1990s. Being able to use HTML to put content on the web is important. In my opinion, LibreWriter produced very clean HTML up until this change was made (especially compared to MS Weird). I would like to recommend LibreWriter to my students - but embedded images are not proper HTML. It leads to all kinds of problems not only with Epubs but with websites and I think it is important that websites and Epubs be interchangable. Linking images is proper HTML and works well. Libre Writer Save as HTML worked well (not perfect but acceptable) up until someone decided that linking images was not needed. Whoever that person was, they were wrong. Thankfully, Open Office still works so I will just have to recommend that option until LibreOffice Save As HTML is restored. As for Elaix, I use that tool all of the time and have attempted to use that tool to get around the problems created by Libre Writer. The person who claimed that works well with Libre Office 5 is also wrong. I have spent several days this past week trying to get Elaix to work with Libre Office 5 and it is very unstable. It crashes with complex documents with more than 100 images. So does Writer 2 Epub. I am currently using Elaix with Open Office 4. It works for some functions but not others. Many functions I simply have to wait and do in Sigil. This really slows down the process of creating complex books. At some point, when I get more time, I will write up a more complete description of the problems of Elaix with Libre Office 5. But I want to make it clear that it is not accurate to say that Elaix works well with LibreOffice 5. It does not. Finally, I do not mean to be complaining or yelling. I am just surprised at the lack of understanding of the need for and importance of linking and not embedding images in HTML.Luke, Thank you for raising this problem to critical. HTML is extremely important to many people who use Libre Writer. HTML is the most basic language of the Internet. From the first days of the Internet, images have been a problem and linking images as a separate file has been an acceptable solution. Embedding images is not an acceptable solution and never has been and never will be. I understand that Open Office also has problems. But this is a critical issue for those of us who use HTML to create content for the Internet. As for Libre Writer simply abandoning the function of being an HTML editor, I think that would be an even worse mistake. It would only result in driving millions of people away from LibreOffice and into the hands of Open Office. I think the solution is to take a close look at how Libre Office handled this issue in the past and how Open Office is currently handling this issue in the present and then adopting similar code. I realize that there are all kinds of problems with XHTML and HTML5 and Mail Merge image insertion. But right now, LibreWriter Save As HTML is broken. So is Export As XHTML. I appreciate the efforts of Elaix, Writer 2 Epub and others. But they also are having trouble keeping up with LibreOffice 5. Perhaps the team should consider slowing down on the new features to make sure that former essential features are working again. May the force be with you.Thanks for all the comments.Probably this is not too hard to add an option and give the choice.So people with some coding experience might feel invited to jump on this?Do realize that there are always more experienced people to help a hand when needed.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***We have some movement on this, yea!Oliver S. is reworking code for thepatch, to restore support for linked images in the HTML as user prefers, while keeping base-64 encoding for mail merge support.Thanks Oliver!=-ref-=Oliver Specht committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":tdf#63211: saving embedded images to HTML optionalIt will be available in 5.2.0.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

I have downloaded a second copy of the installer, to no avail, and I've uninstalled version 3.4.I was able to install LibO 3.5 on a WindowsXP laptop without problems. DUP of "- Uninstall Problems with MSI on Windows 7 64bit"?@reporter:please check and complete your bug report! May be hints on <> will help you to find out what information still is needed?Andras, does it trigger any bell?If I understand it correctly, the reporter was able to install LO-3.5 after uninstalling LO-3.4. AFAIK, it is not a general problem. It might be caused by some strange state of the system => it should not block the next release => lowering the severity a bit.Reporter did not answer, so we should simply close this one. We had some issues that the user had to use an uninstall tool to remove 3.4.4 before he was able to install 3.6, may be reporter has the same problem.So closing.@Reporter:Please feel free to reopen this bug if you find out that the problem still exists with the current stable LibreOffice version and if you can contribute requested additional information (especially: 34 bit? Update from 3.4.4 to 3.5?) due to <> (especially BugReport Details)!

id=50057	Createdcommented snippets from defective content.xml in ODTProblem description: When editing an ODT document with a larger number of tracked changes (redlines), Writer occasionally hangs, formatting the document ad infinitum, with only short intervals when it reacts to user input again. If the file is saved (or autosaved) when this occurs, it is corrupted by having the same draw:frame element being replicated several thousand times in a row.Steps to reproduce:I haven't found a way to trigger this behaviour consciously, unfortunately. But I haven't found a way to avoid it, either... (except for avoiding the record changes function).I cannot disclose the defective documents but I'm attaching commented snippets from the content.xml file of one.Current behavior:When examining the content.xml file in the corrupt ODT, it is pretty obvious where the behaviour comes from: In the text:tracked-changes-section of the file, there is always a text:changed-region/text:deletion element which contains several thousand copies of the same draw:frame element. Likewise, the body section contains a paragraph containing several thousand copies of the same frame.I assume, Writer hangs because it takes so long reformatting the document.In effect, it is impossible to edit the file in Writer, so there is no way to simply remove the paragraph which contains the replicated frames. I usually try to kill LibreOffice (or OpenOffice) before it autosaves the corrupt file, so that I can start again from a recent intact autosaved version. If I fail to do so, I always unzip the content.xml file, search for the several thousand copies of the same lines, delete the sections by hand and zip the edited content.xml back to the ODT.Replicated frames have occurred in documents with a large number of tracked changes and text frames anchored with the paragraph or character. The frame being replicated is usually not the place that I edited at the moment when Writer hangs, so I'm not sure what triggers this behaviour. But it seems to have to do with having inserted frames in a deleted text sequence.Platform (if different from the browser): This last time Ubuntu Linux x86_64, but I have been seeing this bug with several versions of OpenOffice (under 32-bit Ubuntu 9/10) as well. I get the same problem in 3.5.3.2, build id 350m1(Build:2), which is the latest version available under Ubuntu 12.04.I have a frame with a link to an image. If I scroll to the page containing the image, then the frame replicates. Once there were about 60. After waiting for the page to redraw as new instances of the frame were added, I clicked on the frames, one by one, and deleted them.Today the problem is much, much worse. I waited over an hour, then closed Writer.The contents.xml contains 8,212 copies of the frame! I used emacs to delete an extra 8,210 copies and see what happens.What happened was that as soon as I tried to get to the page where the problem occurs, LO hangs, presumably re-inserting the same frame over and over...BTW, I noticed the following line above where the frame is: <text:h text:style-name="P13" text:outline-level="4"><text:bookmark-start text:name="__RefHeading__10012_38549477811111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111"/><text:span text:style-name="T5">fir_interp2_s</text:span> Semantics<text:bookmark-end text:name="__RefHeading__10012_38549477811111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111"/></text:h>I used emacs to get rid of the "extra" ones on those __RefHeading tags (a few hundred of them) and got rid of the extra 8,211 frames, and LO is behaving again.The problem still occurs in 3.5.5.2.I have 16,384 instances of the same frame, all on top of itself.(In reply to)Could you attach any example documents to allow others to check on differentsystem/build?I'll have to cleanse it, because it has company confidential info in it.

You might have to adjust this to see the two pictures.To demonstrate the bug:1. Turn on Edit/Changes/Record Changes.2. turn off Edit/Changes/Show Changes.3. put your cursor after the text "Lsklf".4. Type a few characters, newlines, etc. until the picture starts replicating.Please let me know if this does or does not replicate the problem.I have tried your attached test document Test1.odt (LO 3.4.4, Ubuntu Linux 64bit). The first picture is being replicated, though I don't get thousand of copies. LO still remains managable, although the constant rerendering/reformatting of the image part of the screen when inserting text makes it difficult. But replications seem to start when I _delete_ text, insertion seems OK.Great! I'm glad it's reproducible. I hope someone will work on it soon!I tried the file a second time, now with "show changes" enabled. This time it was worse: Working with LO became impossible because it didn't respond for minuted. Replication of the frame started after the first edit. LO completely stalled after some time.Attached are versions of the file made after some edits with "track changes" and "show changes" enabled (LibreOffice 3.4.4, Ubuntu AMD64 11.10):- inserted a new paragraph between 2 deleted paragraphs (file Test1_edit_1.odt)- inserted a space (file Test1_edit_2.odt)- inserted a "?"

I took one of my old files that I had repaired "by hand", and replaced all characters to be able to post it here as an attachment.

Libreoffice locks up when it gets to the page with the illustration that replicates forever.My only workaround is to edit the xml, removing the replicated frames.is anybody still experiencing this bug with recent LibO 4.0.4 or 4.1.0 releases?(In reply to)tested on LibO 4.1.1.2 under Win7 64bit.I think that when you say "replication" you mean blinking and moving of the picture... at least this is what I see on my PC with your test file...se here are my findings:1- first image "replication" starts immediately after loading the file, then it gets stable after a few seconds. document is still responsive.2- adding some text and a new line after "Lsklf" --> "replication" starts again then image gets stable after a few seconds. document is still responsive.3- remove some text --> "replication" starts again but never stops. document is unresponsive. had to kill soffice.bin so the bug is still CONFIRMED. moving from mab3.6 to mab4.0 list since 3.6 is EOL.interestingly if I try opening the test file with LibO 4.2.0 alpha (master build Sept.3) I receive "Read-Error. Error loading file" alert and cannot open that file.(This is an automated message.)Setting priority to highest as this is a 4.0 MAB. This is part of an effort to make the importance of MAB reflected in priority too.Moving to mab4.1 () because:- 4.0 reached EOL (End Of Life)- bug confirmed in later versionbug still present in 4.2.4.2moving to mab4.2 list since 4.1.x is EOLbug still present in 4.3.4.1moving to mab4.3 list since 4.2.x is EOLI can confirm this bug using LibreOffice 5.0.1.2 downloaded from libreoffice.org.

Sadly there are some serious and hard to find/fix field-focussing issues on Mac OSX. Moving this from 3.6 to 4.0Adding myself to the CC list. This is annoying not simply because the control focus doesn't work as expected, but because the result is that the search term is pasted into the body of the document, which might go unnoticed by the user, especially if they also use LibreOffice on another platform where it does work as expected (Linux). (That happened to me the first time.)Since someone mentioned MS Word 2011 for Mac also has this bug, I tested OpenOffice 4.0 and found it too has the same problem.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Please elevate the status of this bug to critical. It can cause unnoticed destruction of data.It may also help to change the title from "cannot paste" to "pasting overwrites other data without warning".I add Tor Lillqvist to CC list.I've seen him fixing a lot of MacOS specific bugs recently.Hmm, yeah, this is an embarrassing bug. And it is LibreOffice-specific, the "search bar" thingie is something the two other products based on the same original codebase don't have.I guess one relatively easy fix would be to not use the "search bar" on OS X but always bring up the full Find & Replace dialog window. (The one you now get with Alt+Cmd+F.) Sure, the "search bar" (is that its real name?) would be nice if it worked properly, but as it doesn't...@V Stuart: Re:, LibreOffice (and OOo) is of course very far from a typical Cocoa application code-wise, it does not use Cocoa "widgets" for instnace, so generic instructions on how to code for Cocoa are not directly applicable to LibreOffice's code-base.Actually, I would say that the same bug *does* exist also on Linux, but it has to be invoked in a different way: You have to use Edit:Paste while the findbar's text input field has focus, that causes a paste into the document, not into the findbar. (Control-V works as expected, pastes into the findbar.) Most likely fixing that on Linux will fix the behaviour on OS X, too.I think that unlike on Linux, on OS X an accelerator like Command-V is more tightly coupled to actually work as if the corresponding menu entry was selected. (This is obvious from the fact that in OS X (in all applications, not just LibreOffice), when pressing for instance Command-V, one sees the "Edit" menu entry highlight for a moment.)***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***CONFIRMED on Ubuntu 12.04.3 + LO 4.2.0.1(In reply to)Yes -- this perfectly describes the behavior I see on Ubuntu.So it looks like this really IS a bug.

Select All also fails to work properly: It selects the text in the document instead of text in the Find bar.This is still happening in 4.2.0.2 on Mac OS X 10.9Moving to mab4.1 () because:- 4.0 reached EOL (End Of Life)- bug confirmed in later version(In reply to)First off, the Edit:Paste "issue" is reproducible under Windows, too.But I wanted to notice one thing. The "Edit" menu behaviour cannot be regarded a bug. Actually, this is the way it should be: Edit menu describes actions that should be performed in edited document, not in some other auxiliary windows (such as Find toolbar edit box). The same goes for Edit->Select All, etc. (you wouldn't expect bringing another Find toolbar to search within first Find edit box when you select Edit->Find while inside find toolbar?)Thus, this must not be "fixed", as suggested in.The problem is that both main menu (controlling main edit area) and context menu (controlling currently active widget) have the same accelerators listed.But in other OSes, the context menu accelerators have priority, while under OSX, main menu has.Thus, this looks to be a clear OSX-only bug.On other OSes, there is only visual ambiguity, when one has focus in Find (or any other auxiliary) box, clicks Edit menu and sees all those shortcuts listed there, thus has impression that they will act on document, while actually the shortcuts would work inside the auxuliary window. Well, this is just cosmetic.Under OSX, this is really a problem, things don't work as expected. And THE way to fix this would be to DISABLE all Main Menu accelerators while caret is outside the main edit window, and restore them on entry. Of course, this could also be done on other OSes, to remove the visual ambiguity (so, when outside the main edit area, (some) main menu entries would not have accelerators listed next to them). This would fix all the mess, without need to break normal operation of Main menu.I guess you can say it isn't a bug (and I'd argue you're dead wrong - and it's been happily labelled as a bug for nearly 2 years), but that's OK.It does not behave the way users want or expect. It does not behave the way other apps behave. It is not the desired behavior.Whether it's a bug, an anti-feature, a feature, or a brilliant new feature, it isn't what users want."But I wanted to notice one thing. The "Edit" menu behaviour cannot be regarded a bug. Actually, this is the way it should be: Edit menu describes actions that should be performed in edited document, not in some other auxiliary windows (such as Find toolbar edit box)."This is plain wrong on the Mac, and not how any other app on the Mac behaves. (I do not know about Windows ir Linux). But if you are making a cross-platform app, it should work like a native app on all platforms.On the Mac it has always been the case that you can paste into native dialog boxes, for example, either by command-key, or by menu."Under OSX, this is really a problem, things don't work as expected. And THE way to fix this would be to DISABLE all Main Menu accelerators while caret is outside the main edit window, and restore them on entry."And that too would not be how native applications work on the Mac. Suggesting disabling functionality instead of fixing it is unhelpful.(In reply to)Unfortunately, I don't have a Mac. So I don't know what is "native" there. Could you explain, if native Mac applications are expected to use main menu to paste into any active vidget? I mean, do you expect that when the caret is inside "Find" vidget, you will click main menu, and then Paste, ant this will paste into Find string?If so, isn't Mac menu Edit expected to be changed when a vidget is active, to reflect only those commands that are relevant to active vidget (i.e., to look like contect menu)?(In reply to)Absoultely standard behaviour for all native applications. E.gYes.Or you can paste a password into a password dialog. And so on.Simply put, if you choose Paste on a Mac, when editing text, it will paste wherever the caret is. It does not matter if that is a window, a dialog box, or anything else.Furthermore, the Mac makes no distinction whether you use the Edit menu, or a command key - the command key is regarded as just a short cut for using the menu.Yes, menus are supposed to change to reflect conext. However, at the risk of getting boring, being able to paste text wherever you are typing text is expected. Any application which disabled pasting text into dialogs would be considered broken.Then my proposition remains true: I mean, main menu must be modified on entry to vidgets, and restored on return to main edit window. The only mistake I did is what exactly should be modified: it's not shortcuts, but the menu items themselves: they must be replaced with context menu entries that work with active vidget. And this is not the same as what is seen in Linuxes and Windows.By the way, I never meant to disable pasting; what I meant was temporarily remove DUPLICATE accelerators from main menu, that are the same in Main menu and in Context menu, so that no conflict exist, and Context menu keys would be active. Well, it's not "disabling functionality", it would enable Ctrl+V as well. But not in a native way. If main menu must be redirected under OSX, well, that should be done, but not under other OSes.Affects me too, LibreOffice 4.2.1.1 build ID d7dbbd7842e6a58b0f521599204e827654e1fb8bMac OS X 10.9 Mavericksplease MacOS X users give an update about the bug status with current 4.2.4.2 LibO release.if bug is still here, please move it from mab4.1 list to mab4.2 since 4.1.x reached END OF LIFEStill reproducible using latest master version -> move to mab4.2till here in 4.2.5.2(In reply to)Version field is the oldest version of LibreOffice you can reproduce the bug.

When scrolling, then deciding to cmd-F, the selection and the unintended paste can meanwhile be miles away. Then, only "doesn't paste into the search field" is his impression, but the document remains altered in error.I once lost valuable data myself by overriding calc fields, so please do all take this bug serious, keep workflows equal on any OS and continue all the brave rocking!Otto (after having made a small donation to the Doc-Foundation today)(In reply to Cor Nouws from)The main problem is that in Calc if you press CMD+F and then CMD+V this overwrites real data in a cell that had the focus before CMD+F, which might (and usually does) go unnoticed.Data loss sounds pretty critical to me.@Kendy, Takeshiwould that be influenced by /vcl/osx/vclnsapp.mm@Tor, can something similar be done here as Matthew dug up for(In reply to xfrz from)Though - looking at my work flow and how one notices work - I do not expect that frequent, I recognize your point...I wrote to the guy that I meant that might be interested in 'bounty-solving' this bug.

I'm not really complaining though, I'm just putting my "basic user hat" and I fully understand that this kind of feedback from a dev perceptive could be seen as something far away from a valuable feedback. Yes, this is a kind of feedback that a "project manager" would appreciate and understand for his value. So this might be the wrong place to say it, to the wrong people, but I have hoped that someone would catch this, because in the long run, users wont use any software with a flaw in a basic capabilities and won't make good publicity to his peers about this software.(In reply to Cor Nouws from)It has been mentioned here before, but i would like to reiterate that data might be overwritten in a cell that is off the screen already - i.e. totally impossible to *notice*.(In reply to Cor Nouws from)Not as much as I hoped - partly because he's working in LibreOffice code really rare, which makes the treshold a bit higher.So it better to look for other options.(In reply to xfrz from)Then - after all - let me set to critical. Again..Still present in LibreOffice 5.1.1 RC1 (LO 5.1.1.1, Mac OS X 10.11.3)Hi Paul; thanks for testing - but rest assured that this bug will not be fixed unexpectedly without this issue being updated ;-)Paul: I heard you were interested in looking into this, so let me add some more code pointers here...The actual task is to find out why pressing the Cmd-V does not hit the vcl::KeyCode::GetFunction() in vcl/source/window/keycod.cxxI'd try to put there a breakpoint, and see where is it called from when you press eg. the key 'a' (as according to, that case enters that), look up the stack, and see where it is coming from; you'll probably see something around vcl/osx/vclnsapp.mm or other .mm file.Then I'd try to put a breakpoint there in the .mm file, and see if you get at least there when pressing Cmd-V; and then find out what is different to the 'a' case, and try to fix that - so that you get to the GetFunction().Talking about vcl/osx/vclnsapp.mm, I am particularly suspicious of the if( pKeyWin && [pKeyWin isKindOfClass: [SalFrameWindow class]] )where in the 'else', they say // #i94601# a window not of vcl's making has the focus. // Since our menus do not invoke the usual commands // try to play nice with native windows like the file dialog // and emulate them // precondition: this ONLY works because CMD-V (paste), CMD-C (copy) and CMD-X (cut) are // NOT localized, that is the same in all locales. Should this be // different in any locale, this hack will fail.and continue with some stuff with cmd-c / cmd-v etc.So maybe as the first thing, I'd try to comment out the "&& [pKeyWin isKindOfClass: [SalFrameWindow class]]" part of the if, and if that helps, we know we need to find a way that still lets the native dialogs working, but makes the cmd-v in the toolbar work.CreatedBacktrace from keycod.cxx after pressing a in Find boxI've been looking into this a bit as well, after being notified about it by Cor. For hardware reasons, I'm using Mac OS X 10.7 and LO 4.3, but I can reproduce the issue.I tried some of Jan's suggestions ():- I tried some changes on vclnsapp.mm. Commenting out the "&& [pKeyWin isKindOfClass: [SalFramWindow class]]" does not change the behavior for me, nor does commenting out the first pKeyWin section, or even the entire pKeyWin section. I reverted those changes for now.- I did a stack backtrace on keycod.cxx, vcl::KeyCode::GetFunction(). Indeed the breakpoint does not get hit when pressing Cmd+V, but it does when pressing 'a'. The steps I took and the output are in the attached file.Is anyone else working on this issue now? Paul? Otherwise, I'll just continue with Jan's suggestion to look up the stack, etc.I've been able to build LO on Mac OS X 10.11 so I'll start debugging as well.Something else I notices that may help:The Find-box is part of a toolbar, but other toolbars such as Calcs Formula toolbar do not exhibit the wrong paste behaviour on Cmd-V or select behaviour on Cmd-A.Paul: I can confirm what you describe.Further findings:Breakpoint at -[SalFrameView keyDown:] (salframeview.mm:958, frame #22 in the stack trace I posted earlier) is not triggered by Cmd+V, though it is by 'a'.Breakpoint at -[NSWindow sendEvent:] (frame #23 in the earlier stack trace) is triggered so frequently that there is no chance to switch to the LO window and press Cmd+V.I probably won't be working on this for the next few days. Hope you can find out more.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***@I revert your change in the summary.Thetouches a different subject. Thanks for noticing that. But to handle that, if desired, a separate issue would be preferred.Ciao, CorA little analysis of flow (debug) and code has learned:a) The target that's hit with paste of context menu in findbar is Edit::Paste() Should this code also eventually be run when Cmd-V is pressed?b) In vclnsapp.mm: when textfield of Findbar has focus Cmd-V, then in sendEvent() [pKeyWin isKindOfClass: [SalFrameWindow class]] is true and for that reason the else if clause with handling for Cmd-V, -C, -X and -A will never be hit.c) The UI type of the findbar is vnd.sun.star.findbar:FocusToFindbar.

That these events end up being handled by the document window is obviously the wrong handler is dispatched.Where would these dispatch statements be inserted in the code ?Already the needed dispatch statement can be found in sendEvent() and just changing but the conditions for these statements to be executed may be all that's required. Currently the condition is that the window is not a SalFrameWindow, it should probably be "if (! bHandled)" and the test for pKeyWin The current code does things like "if (cond) { ... return;} else if {...}". When the if true clause always causes a return, then "else" should be omitted IMHO. Applied to the code of sendEvent() the control flow will be easier to grasp.Question: can sendEvent() recurse ? (possibly via pushback of event)That would allow for kind of FSM style of code (though I would not dare to open a Pandorra's box).(In reply to Paul Oranje from)No. "Frame" in LO terms is usually the whole app window.The find widget already has that handling, it's just that the menu handling occurs before the find widget gets a chance to handle it.Again - they are not handled by the document window, but by the menu handling code (going all the way through vcl's Menu and framework::MenuBarManager).One possible solution is to make Cmd-A|C|V|X|z|Z _never_ go through the menu, but I doubt that it's the right approach in general, and esp. when considering(i.e. that menu items should also work with the find field).

So I believe it's doable too. Maybe you interested in working on this? I'll be happy to review and push your patch when ready.There is however one problem with customization. The menu item can be reassigned to anything else (Tools->Customize...->Keyboard) or even localized (bad idea, but still...), but the find widget has hardcoded Cmd+V etc. AFAIK.

We need this software to perform doc to pdf file format conversions along with other format conversions supported by libre (E.g.: doc2html, doc2ps, html2rtf, wp2html etc.). This is going to be used for a critical project in my division and we need extremely urgent help to answer this question: doc2pdf conversions on the above Libre version has some issues such as extra empty pages being introduced, spill over of text onto next page when there are long headers/footers in every page or dense text. The same issue is being observed in Windows (3.5.4 ) as well as Linux (3.5) versions. Are there any options (command-line / GUI) that we can give in the Libre (Linux/Windows) that could potentially help us with circumventing this issue ? Please let us know on priority. Also is a more stable version of Libre (where these bugs have been fixed) going to be released soon.. if so how soon and when can we download the same? A mail from our architects/technologists describing the issues we are facing is also attached here for your ref (RE: Initial analysis valuation of LibreOffice tools.msg)B) We want to invoke LibreOffice in GUI mode on Linux to test out format conversions manually. Please let us know how to invoke LibreOffice 3.5 in GUI mode using xming. I find an executable called soffice under /usr/lib64/libreoffice/program in the installation.. is this the program that will eventually be invoked as GUI when invoked using an X-server? Please provide some guidance. Thanks. Steps that I have followed (with little success) to invoke the X (GUI) version of Libre are also attached with this mail (FW: Opening soffice process in GUI mode (X windows) on Linux.msg) for your ref .

At first try using LO 3.3.x I opened this file with more than 1 hours load time, it is so annoying, so I back to MS Office Excel just to open that large file. Now, with LibreOffice 3.5.x, the load time for that file has show a great improvement in load file, as we now before 3.5.x it can be opened for 1 hours, now it can be opened for less than 10 minutes depend on PC specification. The problem is not just that, it's appear when I saving that file, it can take more than 30 minutes just to save that file. The larger file, the longer times needed.It's not the only large files. There is another files that larger than it, the size is 224 MB. And when I trying to load that file, LibreOffice just crash after a hour loading time.See attached file for example. sorry, the attachment cannot upload more than 3 MB file, so there is link for the sample fileI am getting huge XLS files when saving spreadsheets as XLS with spreadsheets that previously were similar size or slightly smaller in XLS form than in ODS form.Now the XLS file is well over 50 times bigger than the ODS file!!!This is with V 3.5.5.3 on WINDOWS.This should be already fixed in 3.6 and 3.5.6.Yes, seems to be fixed in 3.6 and 3.6.1.Closing this per.

Open a new presentation2. Create a few slides3. Go to slide sorter / view4. Try to move a slide to a different position using mouse drag and drop.Current behavior:Always results in the moved slide being slide inserted at the beginning of the presentation.Expected behavior:Place the slide, where I dropped it.

Create 4 slides presentation2. Press left mouse button on the first slide in left panel "Slides"3. Move mouse to the down between slides 3 and 44. Release mouse buttonCurrent result : Nothing happen, the slide hasn't move.Graphically the ghost slide and animation to demonstrate where the slide will ordered doesn't appear.Expected result :Slide moved between slides 3 and 4Animation show the futur state.I've made a screen cast to see the behaviour.CreatedBug move slide in Slides panel(In reply to)Fabien,If understood that right, this is what is described at the beginning of this bug.ANY slide moved to a different position ends up being the first slide. So if you move the first slide, it will end up being the first slide.Please confirm, that this is also happening with other slides than the first one.REPRODUCIBLE with* LibreOffice 3.5.4.2 (Build-ID: 165a79a-7059095-e13bb37-fef39a4-9503d18)* LibreOffice/LOdev 3.6.0beta1 (Build ID: 1f1cdd8)both with German langpack installed, both on MacOS X 10.6.8 German UI (Intel).Taking the original description together withand, I can confirm that if I create a simple presentation with 4 slides (I will attach my sample file), sorting slides via drag and drop both-- in the left panel labelled "Slides" or-- in the slide sorterdoes not work correctly.The circumstances are exactly the same in both cases:-- if I try to move the *1st* slide to any other position, most times nothing happens;-- if I try to move *any* *other* slide to another position, either nothing happens or the moved slide is inserted before all other slides (becomes slide #1), regardless where I have dragged the slide to.I say "most times", because the behaviour seems not to be 100% deterministic (there must be some variable I don't understand).And sometimes (cf.), if I try to drag around slides for a while,-- LibreOffice crashes (I will attach the log file); this crash seems to happen a bit more often with beta 1 than with 3.5.4; but the crash log indicates always exactly the same type of crash: the 1st line of the trace for thread 0 is always 0 libsdlo.dylib 0x4325a126 sd::slidesorter::model::PageDescriptor::GetPage() const + 6CreatedTest file forCreatedLog file for crash which occured after some slide drag and dropCan someone please test if this bug is reproducible-- on Windows-- on some Linux variant? Thank you very much in advance!A more complete review with LibreOffice 3.5.4.2.Given four slides numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, what allows 4 x 3 = 12 primary drag actions, I get the following results when dragging slides in the "Slide Sorter" view and/or in the "Slides" section of the main window (the results are identical):1a) Dragging the 1st slide between slide 2 and 3: nothing happens (still 1, 2, 3, 4)1b) Dragging the 1st slide between slide 3 and 4: nothing happens (still 1, 2, 3, 4)1d) Dragging the 1st slide after the last slide: works (result: 2, 3, 4, 1)2a) Dragging the 2nd slide before the 1st slide: works (result 2, 1, 3, 4)2b) Dragging the 2nd slide between slide 3 and 4: 2 is inserted before 1 (result 2, 1, 3, 4)2c) Dragging the 2nd slide after the last slide: works (result 1, 3, 4, 2)3a) Dragging the 3rd slide before the 1st slide: works (result 3, 1, 2, 4)3b) Dragging the 3rd slide between slide 1 and 2: 3 is inserted before 1 (result 3, 1, 2, 4)3c) Dragging the 3rd slide after the last slide: works (result 1, 2, 4, 3)4a) Dragging the last slide before the 1st one: works (result 4, 1, 2, 3)4b) Dragging the last slide between slide 1 and 2: 4 is inserted before 1 (result 4, 1, 2, 3)4c) Dragging the last slide between slide 2 and 3: 4 is inserted before 1 (result 4, 1, 2, 3)Analysis:A) moving a slide via drag and drop before the 1st slide or after the last slide worksB) moving a slide via drag and drop to any other position does NOT work, but inserts the moved slide before the 1st slide. In the special case when the moved slide is already the 1st slide itself, this means that nothing happens at all.CreatedCorrupted sample file, corrupted via a simple sequence of drag-and-drop actionsBut the analysis given in my previous comment holds true only when I do single drag-and-drop actions, i.e. open my sample document () before each step again and try only one step at once.If I do several drag-and-drop actions one after another, I observea) crashes and b) data corruption.I have not found yet a simple way to reproduce the crash with 100% reliability, but here is a simple sequence of drag-and-drop actions which leads to data corruption:1) Open my sample file () with LibreOffice 3.5.4.2 or 3.6beta 1 and switch to the Slide Sorter. The order of the slides is first "1", "2", "3", "4".2) Drag slide "2" after slide "3". The order of the slides is now "2", "1", "3", "4" (wrong!).3) Drag slide "1" (the 2nd one) after slide "3" (the third one). The order of the slides is again "1", "2", "3", "4" (wrong!)4) Drag slide "2" after slide "3". The order of the slides is now "2", "2", "3", "4": corruption!Now we have two slides which look identical at the beginning of the slide show. The old slide "1" is gone.And this is a serious and stable corruption, not only a drawing error: the double slide "2" is still present when I save, close and open the document again, and the old slide "1" is still missing.Attached you find such a corrupted file which is the result of applying the given four steps to my sample file.Some more hints and observations:(a) There are some bug reports which could be related to this issue, especially for Linux, but I can't find any exact duplicates for now:*just says that sorting slides via drag-and-drop does not work at all*is the same (drag-and-drop does not work at all)*speaks about "drag & drop of slides from another document"*seems to speak about how many slides are visible in the slide sorter (if I understand it correctly).(b) Updated summary according to previous comments.(c) This bug is NOT REPRODUCIBLE with LibreOffice 3.4.6 (OOO340m1, Build:602), German langpack installed, on MacOS X 10.6.8 German (Intel).-> The bug is new in 3.5.x, therefore added keyword "regression".(d) This bug is NOT REPRODUCIBLE with LibreOffice 3.4.6, German langpack installed, on WinXP, therefore it seems to be a MacOS X only issue for now. (But someone else should still test Linux).@Thorsten Behrens,@Radek Doulik:I insert your addresses into the CC list of this bug report because you are our Impress experts (and MacOS X expert, too, in the case of Thorsten). This bug seems to be limited to MacOS X for now, but it is nevertheless very important and urgent -- it makes sorting slides in Impress completely impossible, it leads to data corruption and even to crashes. Additionally, it is an regression introduced in LibreOffice 3.5.x.I have done some extensive testing (see especiallyand) to give you an exact description about when slide sorting works and when it doesn't, and what exactly happens when it doesn't work. I hope this helps a bit.Now I ask you: please take a look at this issue. I know you have got much other things to do, but this is definitely a really critical bug, and should be placed high on your Impress priorities list.Thank you very much in advance!The real question is: when does the slide get corrupted; the trace is common as:Thread 0 Crashed: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread0 sd::slidesorter::model::PageDescriptor::GetPage() const + 61 sd::slidesorter::controller::CurrentSlideManager::SetCurrentSlideAtXController(boost::shared_ptr<sd::slidesorter::model::PageDescriptor> const&) + 2132 sd::slidesorter::controller::CurrentSlideManager::SwitchPageCallback(void*) + 633 Timer::Timeout() + 28... from the mainloop ... I wonder if Linux versions have a similar trace. Most likely we need to run this under valgrind / drmemory to go back in time to when the corruption happened.Also - a build with debugging symbols is always going to produce a better trace; I assume we have these for Mac, any chance you could try one if it's easy to reproduce ?The comment in the relevant method doesn't fill one with confidence either:IMPL_LINK_NOARG(CurrentSlideManager, SwitchPageCallback){ if (mpCurrentSlide) { // Set current page. At the moment we have to do this in two // different ways. The UNO way is the preferable one but, alas, // it does not work always correctly (after some kinds of model // changes). Therefore, we call DrawViewShell::SwitchPage(), // too. ViewShell* pViewShell = mrSlideSorter.GetViewShell(); if (pViewShell==NULL || ! pViewShell->IsMainViewShell()) SetCurrentSlideAtViewShellBase(mpCurrentSlide); SetCurrentSlideAtXController(mpCurrentSlide); } return 1;}(In reply to)I will be happy to do so -- but where can I get a Mac build with debugging symbols?@Thorsten:Can you explain me where to get a Mac build with debugging symbols?***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***CreatedLog fr crash after some slides dragânâdrop with Norbert's debug version of LibO 3.6.0.2+(In reply to)@Michael Meeksand other developers:thanks to Norbert's debug version of LibO 3.6.0.2+, I have tested this again and hope that the attached log file for the crash helps to track down the issue. Again, the crash happened after I opened my simple sample file for this bug () and dragged slides forth and back in the "Slides" panel (I did not use the "Slide sorter").In addition, there are some very interesting messages in the _console_. After the first drag-and-drop action (slide 1 dragged after slide 4), the console printed 120 (!!!) times:24.07.12 12:22:20 [0x0-0xa60a6].org.libreoffice.script[2081] warn:legacy.osl:2081:1:/Volumes/Raid0/g_core/sd/source/ui/slidesorter/controller/SlsSelectionFunction.cxx:1848: OSL_ASSERT: mpDragAndDropContextEvery following drag action caused the same line to be printed again, each time, for about 100 times or so.Finally, after the last drag-and-drop action, here are the last four lines which LibO printed to the console (the first one is the same as above, but the 2nd slightly differs, and the 3rd and the 4th one look very interesting):24.07.12 12:25:52 [0x0-0xa60a6].org.libreoffice.script[2081] warn:legacy.osl:2081:1:/Volumes/Raid0/g_core/sd/source/ui/slidesorter/controller/SlsSelectionFunction.cxx:1848: OSL_ASSERT: mpDragAndDropContext24.07.12 12:25:53 [0x0-0xa60a6].org.libreoffice.script[2081] warn:legacy.osl:2081:1:/Volumes/Raid0/g_core/sd/source/ui/slidesorter/controller/SlsCurrentSlideManager.cxx:247: OSL_ASSERT: rpDescriptor.get() != NULL24.07.12 12:25:53 [0x0-0xa60a6].org.libreoffice.script[2081] /Volumes/Raid0/g_core/solver/unxmacxi.pro/inc/boost/smart_ptr/shared_ptr.hpp:428: failed assertion `px != 0'24.07.12 12:25:54 com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[98] ([0x0-0xa60a6].org.libreoffice.script[2081]) Job appears to have crashed: Abort trap24.07.12 12:25:55 ReportCrash[2170] Saved crash report for soffice[2081] version 3.6.0.2 (???) to /Users/eiselemalina/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/soffice_2012-07-24-122554_Kore.crashHope it helps to fix this issue!Hi Roman - thanks so much for your work getting a trace with debugging symbols, however - I suspect you need to run soffice.bin under a debugger to get what we need out of those symbols. If they 'worked' I would expect to see detailed file + line-number information for each method in the call-trace; I suspect the generic crash app doesn't provide that.Either way, this looks thankfully unrelated to the a11y problems though. Looks like a normal slideshow issue - where the cult of uncontrolled asynchronicity tends to lead to poorly lifecycle-managed callbacks - combined (ironically) with poor interactive performance ;-)Thanks !(In reply to)Good to know -- I would have expected much more detailed information myself, but thought that LibO just does not provide it. BTW: *Which* debugger would do the trick, and is there somewhere some kind of guidance *how* to run soffice.bin under that debugger (on MacOS X, of course)?Good news! So I hope some developer, e.g. Thorsten, who is both a Impress and a MacOS X expert, will look into this issue soon?! ;-)Issue still existent in 3.6 release.- slide move animation doesn't show slide (frame), just a black sqare when moving a slide- moved slide still always ends up being the first slide, exception: - when it is moved at the end of one row of slides and you move the cursor outside the slide sorter panel. Then the animation and placement works correkt for the last position in that row.!!! - slide content of moved slide replaces the content of the slide where it is dropped.Tested on openSUSE Linux (with openSUSE provided 3.6 packages): slide sorting is working as expected.(In reply to)Thank you very much for testing again! However, please do not "update" the Version field: the Version field should always contain the FIRST version which is known to contain the bug, and NOT the last one. Thank you ;-)You know - I never understood how this policy works. How can you easily see a list of bugs that have been re-tested vs. a recent version to see if the issue is still there ? :-) but I guess I should ask on the mailing-list.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***This regression is nasty and a nogo for Impress. Working on presentations becomes impossible. Therefore I have increased the importance to highest.The bug is still present in LO 3.6.1.2.Mouse wheel scrolling is also not working - might be a related issue.The latest version of OpenOffice.org (3.4.1) does not have this bug. Hence an ugly work-around is to open the presentation with OOo, rearrange the slides, and continue with LO. This is silly. Where is the download for LO 3.4??The new bug reportâ âClicking Slide Thumbnail of Non-Focused Window Causes Rearrange/Crashâ is nearly related to the present one (but NOT an exact duplicate, so please donât markas a duplicate for now, until we have more insight into the roots of both bugs!).It contains of two parts:1) âClicking on a slide thumbnail in the left pane when LibreOffice does not have window focus causes the selected slide to shuffle to the top of the deck (become slide number one).âIMHO this could be related to the broken drag-and-drop of slides in the present bug report; I mean, both issues could have the same underlying problem.2) âNow that we have rearranged slides, we can click on the thumbnails for the two non-rearranged slides as many times as we want, but any attempts at clicking on the rearranged slide (slide 3 cum 1) will cause LibreOffice to crash.âIMHO this is the same crash as the one reported in the present bug report, because the log files created for the crashes are all more or less identical.So 1) seems nearly related to the present bug report, and 2) identical.I would suggest to mark this bug as a blocker: Due to this bug, you cannot do a presentation in a productive environment with Impress on a Mac as this time.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***(In reply to)Note that 53249 has a test case attached which apparently also manifests on Linux.(In reply to)-> Therefore changed Platform to "All" (even if not reproducible on Windows, we need to use all, if reproducible both on Mac OS and Linux).***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Changed QA person just so that I can easily query.

This should it make much easier to find the root of this regression.@ Thorsten Behrens, Rodo, Muthu Subramanian, and maybe others:Could you please check the (not too lengthy) list of commits between the branching of 3.5.3 and the first RC of of 3.5.4.1? Somewhere there in the committs made to the 3.5/3.5.4 branch must be the root of this regression;and if you can identify it there, it should be possible to fix it on the3.6.x and Master branches.Thank you very much!Wow - Roman - that is some fantastic research ! thanks so much for narrowing it down so far :-) !Createdgit diff -u libreoffice-3.5.3.2..libreoffice-3.5.4.1 -- sdThe commit range indeed shows a change to the D&D code:commit e4450c54aee85b295b933e91d207fd8220c01107Author: LuboÅ¡ LuÅÃ¡k <>Date: Fri May 11 20:33:23 2012 +0200 avoid recursion that can mess up DND setup (fdo#41996) The way too smart ctor for the DND handler started drag immediately, causing a race condition that could recurse to setting a handler again before the first one was actually set, thus immediately again causing the DND to be stopped, and then possibly later again started, depending on how the race condition turned out. Use delayed initialization to avoid this.Lubos - rumour is that this hard-hack / MAB is nearby your fix for.Would a bibisect help?No - we already found the commit in question (assuming Roman's range is right - and it looks very plausible) - thanks ! now it's either fix that commit or revert it.(In reply to)Would a Valgrind trace help to understand why this commit gives this bug?Perhaps the commit is ok in itself but triggers a buggy part of code.(In reply to)I am quite sure about the range (and everybody can, at least on Mac OS X, check it himself/herself: just download 3.5.3.2 and 3.5.4.1 fromand test if you, like me, can reproduce the issue in 3.5.4.1, but not in 3.5.3.2).The only little question which I, as a layman, see is if the problem was really caused (only) by commit e4450c54aee85b295b933e91d207fd8220c01107, or if another commit could be involved (too).Of course, I donât see any other commit in that range which could be involved (all other commits related to Impress look innocent, e.g. 009776a16410024a9437847af065d2160b434f30); but only a code expert can really judge this. So, if there are any doubts about the question if e4450c54aee85b295b933e91d207fd8220c01107 is really the (only) guilty one,our Impress experts should check the list of all commits (ca.120?) in that range.Has somebody actually built a version with the patch reverted to confirm it is really triggering the problem? The change should not have any other effects other than fixing the bug it fixed, so either it's not that, or something somewhere else is broken (race condition, whatever).For what it's worth, I can't get any drag-and-drop to work, in Impress or Writer, in a master build on the Mac currently...(In reply to)It works for me on Mac OS X 10.6.8 (Intel) with the master buildLOdev 3.7.0.0.alpha0+ (build ID: 370m0(Build:0); pull time: 2012-10-25 06:12:34)frombut only as well or as badly as reported here:D&D of text snippets in Writer seems to work well;D&D of slides in Impress works only partly (see commend #10),and if I continue, the corruption happens (see).Ha, I spoke too soon, it must have been some weird temporary glitch; simple d&d in Writer *does* work normally for me. And I indeed can reproduce the slide re-ordering problem. Will now try to see if reverting the patch helps.Yes, after git revert e4450c54aee85b295b933e91d207fd8220c01107 drag-and-drop in the slide sorter seems to work fine... Over to Lubos;)Looked into it with Lubos a bit and I now have a fair idea what to look for and where to debug... will do that in the coming days. (Lubos has no Mac.)I debugged this during the flight home and found out the root cause to the problem (but not how to fix it): On the Mac, all the drag-and-drop action happens during the call to pSlideSorterViewShell->StartDrag() in the Initialize method. Thus no wonder that mpDragAndDropContext is null in the ProcessDragEvent() as it has not been initialized yet, and is in fact initialised only after the drag-and-drop already has finished.I have a vague feeling that the same thing might happen on Windows, too, but will have to build me a fresh Windows build to verify. (I vaguely remember seeing something similar happening back in the days while working on the GTK port to Windows.)(Nope, does not happen on Windows.)New to LibreOffice (OpenOffice user for many years) I first posted this the other day in Ask LibreOffice."Using Version 3.6.2.2 (Build ID: da8c1e6) on a MacAir running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 I cannot re-organize Impress slides by any method described in Help: Slide Sorter, Slide pane in Outline, etc. Occasionally a slide will move but only to the front of the slide deck. Occasionally the moved slide will replace another one. Usually after enough attempts LibreOffice crashes."I have now discovered the workaround posted: attempting to move a slide beyond the active window, then bringing it back into the window produces the thumbnail (which previously did not render). With the thumbnail visible I can drop the slide into position. This appears to work in Slide Sorter, or the Normal view also.This is a copy of the Comment posted today forwhich seems to be superseded by this bug.If you need more info I'm(In reply to)(probably not the best way to report but that's the occasion:)Now that this seems related to the drag and drop function on mac, there is another issue that has been annoying me on the mac version for quite a while (i.e. I think all 3.5 and 3.4 version are concerned):one should wait a while (~1 second) when moving a border of any shape to have the proper behavior. Otherwise a click on the handle and move immediately, the complete object is moved.Boudry: thanks for your input - but please -never- clutter a single focused bug with an unrelated issue - please file a new bug for your problem.Tor - any cycles to debug this and/or get a stack trace from the constructor and Initialize methods on Mac so others can jump in ?Thanks ! :-)Michael: The core surprising point that Lubos's patch wasn't aware of was that all the drag-and-drop happens during the call to pSlideSorterViewShell->StartDrag(); that returns only after the whole drag-and-drop operation has finished.For now, I fixed it in master by just reverting the patch for MacOSX only:commit 192a0eb2beccee5349c3c7b60208aa95eb985f35Author: Tor Lillqvist <>Date: Wed Nov 7 15:50:21 2012 +0200 fdo51023: Revert e4450c54aee85b295b933e91d207fd8220c01107 for Mac OS X See bug for discussion. Basically, the root cause to the problem is that on the Mac, all the drag-and-drop action happens during the call to pSlideSorterViewShell->StartDrag() in the Initialize method. Thus no wonder that mpDragAndDropContext is null in the ProcessDragEvent() as it has not been initialized yet, and is in fact initialised pointlessly only after the drag-and-drop already has finished.

id=51973	Problem description: Calc always hangs while pasting the cell content copied from the top of a column (C1) containing a simple formula (A1*B1) to rest of the cells all the way to the end of the same column(down to C1048576).Steps to reproduce:1. .... Open a new spreadsheet in Calc.2. .... Fill A1 with a random number. (e.g. '1')3. .... Fill B1 with a random number. (e.g. '2')4. .... Fill C1 with a formula '=A1*A2'5. .... Copy C1.6. .... Select C2 and press Ctrl + down arrow to move to the end of the column C.7. .... Press Ctrl + Shift + up arrow to select(highlight) the entire column from the bottom up and return to C1.8. .... While holding Ctrl, click C1 to exclude the cell from the current (highlighted) selection.9. .... Press Ctrl + v to paste the previously copied cell content of C1 to the rest of the cells in the column.Current behavior: Calc hangs and stops responding.Expected behavior: The copied cell content/formula is applied/pasted to the selected cells.Platform (if different from the browser): Browser: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C) Confirmed.The first time I tried this, it eventually came out of the hang after less than 20 minutes. The cells were pasted correctly.I then tried a similar thing (but selecting almost the whole column, ) and it hung for 30 minutes+ before I killed it.Trying on a new document, I was able to paste the same formula into 300,000 rows in around 7 minutes.All the while the CPU was at full utilisation.My results suggest this is a performance / scaling problem.FWIW, trying the same thing in Excel, works instantly.Please pay attention to this issue ASAP! I am unable to work with my spreadsheet in which a simple multiplication formula (A cell * B cell) was applied to the very bottom of the sheet and after saving the document I am unable to batch delete the cell content without freeze and 100% system resource.The 18MB file takes 10 minutes to open, 10 seconds to switch between sheets and doesn't unfreeze for the last 14 hours after batch content deletion is assigned to the column with the formula.Both LO 3.5.5 and LO 3.6 RC1 constantly crash during handling of the spreadsheet, while OO 3.4, at least, freezes and doesn't crash.I imagine this is a pure performance / scalability issue in the spreadsheet - we're working on these as a long term task. Then again - it'd be really nice to get a stacktrace of where it crashes / hangs if possible.May I send you the sample file over e-mail? It's a non-disclosure document which requires confidentiality. The file size is around 18-19MB.Seems solved in LibreOffice 3.6.0.4rc(In reply to)Win7x64UltimateTested. The spreadsheet doesn't crash but it still takes several minutes to open and hangs during batch deletion of the cells with pasted formula.Now takes 15 seconds to Paste on LO 3.6.0.4 Win Vista SP1 32bit.Deletion of the pasted cells takes roughly 5 seconds.I was also able to repeat the test (during the same session) without any problems.15 seconds is not ideal, but it is at least somewhat expected.We're doing some major structural work here for 3.7/4.0 see the blog at eg.The expectation is that this will be very much quicker for 3.7/4.0 - and there is not much that can be done for 3.6 - so marking FIXED.
id=51819	Via IRC by _nedRWhen Ubuntu crashes and has to be restarted via commandlineAfter restarting the PC and starting LibreOffice and, of cource, recovering the file, the password protecion got lost.... I managed to reproduce this on Ubuntu 12.04 (LibreOffice v3.5.3) by doing the following steps:1. Save and close whatever documents you may have open in LibreOffice2. Open a new document in LibreOffice (Writer, Calc, Draw, or Impress); Enter some data into it.3. Save the document with a password in any file-format.4. Go to Tools>Options; Select the Load/Save>General page of options; Ensure the entry "Save AutoRecovery information every" is checked and set the "Minutes" value to 1 minute and press OK.5. Enter some more data.6. After waiting for at least 1 minute for the AutoRecovery info to be saved, open up a terminal and kill soffice.bin7. Open LibreOfficeExpected behaviour :- LibreOffice Should display the File AutoRecovery Dialog box. On clicking Next; It should prompt for a password before recovering the document.Actual behaviour :- LibreOffice successfully recovers the file without asking for the password. Furthermore when you save the file, it is saved without a password.I tried to reproduce this error on my Windows partition which had LibreOffice v 3.4.1 but couldn't, so I imagine this is a recent regression.I also wonder whether this implies that the AutoRecovery file is stored unencrypted on the filesystem, because that would be less than ideal from a security point of view.Indeed I can reproduce it in the way described...And I see the problem in 3.5.3 too. And in 3.4.6.But not in 3.3.4 ...So it has to do with the major encryption change in that time?(set version to 3.4.6 releasehave checkd 3.4.0, that does not have the problem!but I did not check versions 3.4.1-3.4.5 .. )hmm, it does happen for the first time in 3.4.6 !This bug is happening to me in Windows XP Home SP3 in LO 4.0.0.3 (Build ID: 7545bee9c2a0782548772a21bc84a9dcc583b89).After a crash, or a power failure, all of the open files lose their passwords. The files that weren't open at the time of the crash don't lose their passwords.It might have something to do with the Save with password checkbox in the Save As dialog box becoming unticked. Perhaps the Recovery function doesn't recover the password.This is a major problem to me because the info in the files really needs to be password protected.I think that LO is better than OpenOffice, but I'll be using OO until this problem is fixed.Confirmed here: Windows XP, LibreOffice 3.6.5.2Unfortunately also confirmed that the recovery file is saved WITHOUT ANY protection, fully unencrypted into the backup directory (user/backup)!IMHO it is a very nasty bug in terms of security, that should seriously be taken into account, and resolved as soon as possible!Now by switched on recovery the "password protected" document gets saved every 5-10 minutes without ANY protection, easily recoverable by not much advanced techniques (eg. undeleting the backup file). It is a MAJOR problem in terms of security, and users definitely should be warned of this, making them switch off the auto-recovery as a temporary workaround.Changed title to stress importance.Nominating as HardHack...As well as the password being lost in LO, OO 3.4.1 Build 9593 on Windows XP Home SP3 loses it as well. The computer crashed and blue-screened. When the document was re-opened, the password protection had disappeared. My previous post:Now I'm thinking of using OxygenOffice instead. But I bet it has the same bug because OxygenOffice is built from OpenOffice!I really ask you to be patient...This issue is being raised - thanks Florian for bringing it to my attention - I will be letting the appropriate people know about itIt's great to hear that this issue is finally receiving the attention it deserves. Thanks, guys!Patches / volunteer developer input most welcome - of course.On pc Debian x86-64 with master sources updated today, I don't reproduce this.Now, perhaps I missed something since autorecovery didn't even appear (although I had run a kill -9)(This is an automated message.)LibreOffice development currently prioritizes bugs with the so called MAB (most annoying bugs) -- as this bug has not run through that process (including writing a short rationale for this bug being a candidate and other who are watching the tracker bug silently approving that rationale etc.) its priority is set to high. Note this is effectively no change in the urgency assigned to this bug, as we are currently not making a difference between high and highest and severity is untouched.You can find out more about MABs and how the process works by contacting libreoffice qa on irc:The QA wiki page also gives you hints on how to get in contact with the team (if IRC fails you, your next best choice is the mailing list):Any update on this, is anybody working on it?Should not be a critical security bug taken more into account, or at least the users warned?And why got the hard hack stuck in the proposed state, should not it be accepted to start the work?Is this bug maybe an NSA "feature"? (Just kidding... hopefully)Just tried, still present in 4.1.4.2Sorry to say this, but if there is no progress, I will try to inform the users and the media directly about this.It is a serious security bug, introduced in 3.4.6 (!), completely ignored for more than 1,5 year (!!) now.The users have the right to know about this security issue, even if it could potentially cast some negative light on LO.- thanks for your feedback; security is clearly important to you - if you're deeply concerned about your data in this way, I would strongly suggest using an encrypted disk: that way document level security is less important, and your data safer overall.If you want to turn your passion into something constructive here, you are more than welcome to work with us to study the code, provide a patch and address the issue: as a community we're eager to help get new people involved, with code pointers, build instructions etc. The ability to type, think and dedicate time to improving the code for others are the only pre-requisites to starting the journey to be an elite coder: you can do it !In the absence of that your suggested approach is unlikely to win many friends in the community you care about; no doubt the underlying issue will be fixed one day - in the medium term I want to get rid of autosave altogether and stream unsaved edits to the file in question as/when we do that encryption will no doubt be part of the picture.All the best.(In reply to)To be honest I never look at the wording in the dialog on document recovery.Could it be that there is space there to inform users to check password protected files that were active when a crash occured?@Michael Meeks - thanks for your answer, but I think you clearly not understood the severe of this bug.To clear some point:1. Security is not important only for me, it is important for everybody who uses password-protection.2. _I_ personally know how to circumvent this bug, but a lot of people does not even dream of having such a big security hole in LO (for more than 1 year), so they are totally helpless against it.3. You advertised the encryption changes in 3.5 as "more secure", while it is just the opposite, saving now a password-protected document every 10-15 minutes completely unencrypted all over the file system.4. I am pretty sure, that it would take only a 30-45 minute debugging session for an experienced developer to find the hole and fix it (maybe just some false flag set somewhere); and I am also almost sure, that nobody took the time to do it from the dev team in the past 1,5 year.5. I tried to download and compile the sources last year to fix this issue, but it was anything else than easy or self-explaining. Maybe I will try again now, but cannot promise anything.6. If somebody without any dev. experience finds in LO a severe security issue, than he has to fix it himself, or nothing happens? And even if he did it, would you accept a security patch from anybody out there, outside of the core team? Sorry, but it sounds a bit lame... (NSA sends its greetings)7. Since 3.5 a lot of minor changes / improvements were made, so there were clearly no resource problem to fix such an issue.8. You did not even accept the proposed hard hack (a critical security bug!) without even explaining why.9. The users DO have the right to know about this issue, and I am pretty sure that if they did, this bug would get a lot more noise and complaining.10. I am just a regular user not a developer, but "to turn my passion into something constructive here" I suggest you to take a look aroundandand maybe in a short time this bug could be fixed at last without further headaches.: about building LO you can find great help here:I'm not going to comment too much more on this but let me just correct one thing. Fixing this will likely take days or weeks of dev time not the 30-45 minutes that was stated. If you're not a develop working on our code you can't possibly know how much time something takes to fix so throwing out numbers is just another good way to not make friends in the community.Please feel free to build LibreOffice as Julien has provided a link and we have an IRC chat where we can also help. I have almost no CS background and I build based on those instructions.Also if you're running Linux these are good instructions:"There are two kinds of cryptography in this world: cryptography that will stop your kid sister from reading your files, and cryptography that will stop major governments from reading your files."This bug although applicable in case 2 also (for which you can workaround by encrypting your file system), has more to do with case 1. eg:- Your system crashes (say power failure). Someone else (say your spouse) uses your computer when the power comes back; opens LibreOffice, gets prompt to recover files. opens document you didn't want them to see (say divorce filing you have been drafting). This bug is very nasty for that reason - Its well-hidden, and manifests itself in a very bad way.This bug is a regresssion since version 3.4.1. My question is -has the architecture changed so much that it is hard for a developer to issue a fix? Asking someone else who is not an expert coder, to issue a fix is unrealistic. I imagine it would take at least a month of effort, for a normal developer, just to familiarize himself with the architecture of a large s/w system like LibreOffice.Yes since that release a lot of lines have changed. Even for experts it takes some time to track down what is going on (millions of lines of code, developers can only be familiar with so much of it, and once they move to a new section, they have to re-familiarize themselves if they have to go back).Thanks for the links, but I think, you did not get the picture.This bug is a problem not for me, but for LO.A professional system cannot afford such security holes, especially not for such a long time.Just imagine some headlines:"Everybody can open your 'protected' LibreOffice documents without knowing the password""LibreOffice developers waiting for a newbie to fix the issue at last"It is a bit absurd, isn't it?I filed a lot of bugs into different systems, but nobody ever wanted to make me, a user responsible for fixing the bug (especially not a security one).I think, the people who were participated in the 3.5 changes should take a look into it, solve the issue ASAP and then this bug should be buried silently as deep as possible (it is not really a good ad for LO, which I personally like very much).I will not post here again (completely useless), but I will inform the other users about this issue if there is no progress this week.and once again - these threats are meaningless. FLOSS is a community - we've done what we can to get you to actually help solve the problem and you have refused to offer anything more than threats and comments. If you ever want to actually help the project, feel free to email me personally as I have more than 10x what I can possibly handle on my plate and would love for someone (you) to volunteer to deal with some of them(In reply to)Okay, although this might sound impolite: Repo steps1) Start LibeOffice2) Open an encrypted file3) Enter password4) Crash OS5) Log into the same user account ([a] with no password [b] with the text on a note right in front of the PC)Let me phrase this way. The document has to be encrypted in RAM, as well as the password. IF someone really loves to, it will ever be possible...The bad thing about this bug is, that LibO forgets, that it is password protected....You did understand, that without YOU (or someone else) paying for this fix it might take weeks, without months???What has to be changed:1) Save recovery file with password ("", if not specified)2) After crash, try to open it with "" pw (ask for password otherwise) [for every opened document]Quoting chromium source: "Be wary of surveillance by secret agents or people standing behind you."Anyway, any code pointers. I found these:I am not a dev, neither do I have spare time to help more.... (Yes, we are doing this for free)Maybe this is the routine:It says that "if the document was loaded with a password, it should be stored with password" and also seems to set the password, but something not OK with it.Maybe a quick debugging would show what is really missing.removing regression keyword as nothing in the comments suggest it is one.Bjoern - haven't verified butsays something about a version workingThere are also a number of differences in the code paths used between save and autosave that create a number of problems; not least with image and macro loss/corruption in some circumstances that have been there ~forever and need unwinding =)Confirming regression.Initial test with LO 3.3.4 Mac OSXCreate Writer documentType some textSave with passwordSet preferences to autosave every 1 minuteKeep typing more textAfter 1.5 minutes, force kill LO 334Restart LO 334, autorecovery proposes to recover document and asks for password.Save and close document and LO.Start LO 3.5.7Load file.Enter passwordCheck autorecovery settings to same as for LO 334Enter some more text, wait 1.5 minForce kill appRestart LO 357, autorecovery proposes to recover document but does not ask for password.

Let us know at what point it breaks. Apparently it is between 3.3.4 & 3.4.6 (test pre-releases and releases).

I've pinged Markus about it to see what he thinkspossibly related: fdo#37825/fdo#38561.Some more info:AOO had the same bug as(or):Its patch was then cherry picked into LibO:And now AOO has also the same bug as this one:Just an idea:if PROP_ENCRYPTIONDATA would also be put into lNewArgs in this routine (as from the original document it will be cleared later in preDoSaveAs_Impl):... it would maybe solve the problem?(unfortunately cannot try myself...)A quick recap on the foregoing (for future reference):* we know now, what made this security issue appear: see,* we have a (possible) solution to fix it: see* the necessary changes seem to be fairly simple: 3-4 new lines to add into one file, mostly copy&paste (see)* we are waiting for a developer who has some free hours to actually make the changes, test it and (hopefully) commit itSo it seems that we users cannot help more to get this issue solved at long last (if yes, let us know).Just stubled in, here.My system isn't that fast so test-compiling would last quite long ...But if one of the maintainers could check out if maybe this could work - modified lines according to mentioned3233 // if the document was loaded with a password, it should be 3234 // stored with password 3235 utl::MediaDescriptor lNewArgs; 3236 OUString sPassword = lOldArgs.getUnpackedValueOrDefault(utl::MediaDescriptor::PROP_PASSWORD(), OUString()); 3237 if (!sPassword.isEmpty())- 3238 lNewArgs[utl::MediaDescriptor::PROP_PASSWORD()] <<= sPassword;- 3239 + 3238 {+ 3239 lNewArgs[utl::MediaDescriptor::PROP_PASSWORD()] <<= sPassword;+ 3240 OUString sEncryptionData = lOldArgs.getUnpackedValueOrDefault(utl::MediaDescriptor::PROP_ENCRYPTIONDATA(), OUString());+ 3241 lNewArgs[utl::MediaDescriptor::PROP_ENCRYPTIONDATA()] <<= sEncryptionData;+ 3242 }+ 3243I added this to 4.1 MAB.Has anyone tested this with the 4.2 branch? I assume nothing changed but it would be good to know for sure.So I tried to reproduce this in (In reply to)I tried to reproduce this in 4.1.4.2.Created document, typed, saved with password. Typed more into document and crashed LO. Re-opened the document and started the recovery. Was immediately asked for password. I will continue to "stress test" this, but it doesn't seem to be present in this build.(In reply to)The problem here is that sPassword is empty.So, no, it does not work.One would need to investigate why it's empty.(In reply to)SID_PASSWORD, PROP_PASSWORD are deprecated and don't work in most cases. That there are still a few users out there is unfortunate and this bug was introduced with the m106.This code needs to be converted to use SID_ENCRYPTIONDATA which is used all over the place now and is the one making it possible to use the new encryption algorithms.However debugging how to fix this special issue would take a while. I did it in the past for 3.4 and 3.5 to fix most of the m106 regressions but don't have time right now to look into this.git grep SID_ENCRYPTIONDATA should give enough code pointers that show how this should be done and after that it is a good bit of debugging to follow the property though the different XPropertySetsSecurity issues need special handling and absolute priority. Having bugs like this existing for more than one sub version is poor practice. Surely they should be blockers for the next version? Having one active like this one for more than 18 months is IMHO absolutely unacceptable. Do I need to escalate to one of the discussion lists? It seems crucial for an acceptable product that users can be confident that security issues are being handled quickly and with the highest priority.Hi Mike,Genuine security issues do; rest assured. However - volunteering other people's priority and focus is not something you can do. Since the issue is particularly important to you - can you expand on what you're doing to solve this (apparently unacceptable to you) situation ? escalation is unlikely to solve the problem - it has already been assessed by the security team & determined insufficiently serious.As/when there is a patch, we can perhaps move here.User should be confident that we take security issues seriously. However, the level of shrillness and noise around this issue has (at least for me) radically reduced my interest in doing any work to tackle it: it is not acceptable to harass developers. Having said that, very happy to mentor anyone wanting to contribute constructively here. I hope that re-assures you.All the best.@VolkerTwer @MatÃºÅ¡ Kukan @Markus MohrhardThanks for taking time for this issue!It seems we are only a small step away from a working patch!Unfortunately I cannot create one, but I think sg like this would be necessary:InsideOUString sPassword = lOldArgs.getUnpackedValueOrDefault(utl::MediaDescriptor::PROP_PASSWORD(), OUString());if (!sPassword.isEmpty()) lNewArgs[utl::MediaDescriptor::PROP_PASSWORD()] <<= sPassword;+ css::uno::Sequence< css::beans::NamedValue > aEncryptionData = getUnpackedValueOrDefault(utl::MediaDescriptor::PROP_ENCRYPTIONDATA(), css::uno::Sequence< css::beans::NamedValue >() );+ if (aEncryptionData.getLength() > 0)+ lNewArgs[utl::MediaDescriptor::PROP_ENCRYPTIONDATA()] <<= aEncryptionData;So PROP_ENCRYPTIONDATA would be put into lNewArgs too, when needed.IMHO this issue in LibO was introduced this way:1. m106 was merged, and LibO started to use PROP_ENCRYPTIONDATA. At that time the recovery was working without problems, butwas introduced.2.was fixed with these commits:(BTW SID_ENCRYPTIONDATA is cleared twice now due to the two different commits)The first commit introduced this issue, as now ENCRYPTIONDATA is cleared in PreDoSaveAs_Impl from the original document, and it is not put into the property set inside implts_saveOneDoc.So I think the solution could be to put this into the set too.@chtfn @Ryan DunlopHi, I just tried these versions, all of them seem to have the bug too (so it is in the 4.2 branch too):Version Date Bug?4.1.4.2 2013-12-12 X4.1.5.3 2014-02-07 X4.2.0.4 2014-01-29 X4.2.1.1 2014-02-14 X4.2.2.1 2014-02-28 X(The backup file was always unencrypted and for the recovering no password was needed.)@mike.hallHi, I already tried to inform the security team about this issue (although maybe not with the best methods), interestingly they did not find it important enough (perhaps Michael pulled some strings there too?), so it seems, that we must try to solve this issue on our own somehow...@Michael MeeksSorry, but I would be really eager to know what _you_ personally did to solve this issue since you took notice of it (besides maybe playing down its importance, effectively blocking it inside the dev team and forcing your own personal lower standards of security on the whole user base)?Hi Sayt, So - first, I am encouraged by your attempt to provide a patch and to discuss the code: that is to be applauded - if there is a real patch to test, and people are actively engaging with the code trying to contribute and understand what is wrong and help out that is -awesome- and I appreciate it. I'm personally interested in helping mentor such people, there is no shortage quite simple problems that just need a bit of research to fix in LibreOffice, and it'd be great to have help with them.Ah - so perhaps I was the only one that bothered to reply to you =)I reproduce those in order not to comment on them :-) I basically like your challenge; it is a reflection of mine - if you want something done, -you- need to do it =) Ask not what LibreOffice can do for you etc. ... In this case I'm privileged to have Matus work for me, and (as I was encouraged by Volker's patch) I asked him to take a look at / review / test it.In terms of personal contribution here, my hope is to provide some context, and de-escalation =) All the best.Great to hear, that MatÃºÅ¡ is working on it "officially"! (really did not get it until now)If I can help in anything (testing, etc.) just let me know! (except compiling for which sadly my current machine is way too old - maybe after getting a newer one somehow...)BTW I find your strategy really great (and practical) to try to get the users involved into the community and the developing process through the issues important for them.Just a small remark: security issues may not be the ideal candidates for this purpose, maybe they need a bit more special handling (quicker response, more focus from experienced developers, etc.)But I personally really enjoyed browsing the code through the web interface and trying to spot the problem, and surely will try to do this for other issues too, so the strategy definitely functions :-)Thanks for working on this issue! (and sorry for the "shrillness")I think you're missing the point that our developers are almost all volunteers - so telling them what to do is impossible and disrespectful of their time. This really isn't the security concern you've made it seem to be. You tried going to the user list and multiple users (some of our experienced users) commented and none agreed with you. Furthermore, we pointed out that the real solution is encrypting a hard drive - we can't be responsible for users not knowing how to really secure their data. Lastly - commenting over and over again on the bug just makes the bug less useful as it just clogs the bug with comments that don't really say much other than "this is important TO ME" - and like I said - you tried getting other users to agree and none did on the list (there are thousands on that list by the way).To say the least this wasn't the ideal way to push this bug - if a bug is a high priority for you - pay for a fix, or learn how to code. Else, asking us to develop processes to force volunteers to work on a bug is very unlikely to happen.Rest assured for real security bugs you likely would have gotten more positive response from the community (users, devs, QA, etc . . .). If you actually want to contribute and become one of the thousands of volunteers putting in hours of time for free - get in touch, I have plenty of non code related tasks that need done and you can see how it can become irksome when users push for you to dedicate your time in ways that you don't find to be the most productive use of time(In reply to)Just to clarify something here. Let us not call this issue a security issue. It is maybe a privacy issue if you want to give this bug a special name. Accusing us of not caring or not caring enough about security issues is not winning much friends. As Michael already mentioned earlier it has been analyzed by the security team in the past and been classified as normal bug or if you want to call it like that, "privacy" issue.I hope that it makes a bit clearer why this bug has not seen the attention that you would have preferred. There will always be bugs where users and developers have different expectations but it would be nice to not accuse us of not caring enough.Thanks a lot for working on a fix. As you hopefully see it is much more productive to look at an issue yourself than trying to force other people to fix your bugs.As you might have seen if you participate in fixing a bug we'll assist you bug just asking other people to fix it does not work.Your patch looks correct if it works. If it still does not work you would need to debug it a bit and see where we either expect a SID_PASSWORD or somehow still clear the SID_ENCRYPTIONDATA.If you are intersted in these kind of tasks you can try to remove the remaining SID_PASSWORD which might hide a few more similar problems.@Joel MaderoThanks, got the lesson, Mr. QA!Just please take a look on this issue, what you (QA) and what we (users) did to get this issue solved.QA: suggesting to download and install the old versions (which in fact was a good idea), but not really more, not even accepted the Hard Hack.Users: we found the routine, where (with high probability) the problem is, worked out patches, found the first version for the problem, etc.Yes, I was a bit (too) pushy, but without this IMHO we were nowhere near now. You had 1,5 years to solve this issue on your own agenda, which brought what: literally nothing!I really do not understand your attitude toward users trying to patch a security (!) regression (!): you are handling us as we were some criminals, etc. Instead of being glad to have such responsible users who are BTW doing your duties (the QA or an automated test should catch such security regressions even before publishing).Don't worry, I will not comment on this bug anymore, or on any other one.(In reply to)Indeed, great analysis etc, I've tried your patch and it works!Great catch!I think you would like to contribute your patch ?Can you create it with help ofor just give me your name & e-mail adrress and I will create it for you.And we would need your license statement too as described inAdd yourself to the developers list there or we will do it for you after the license statement.Thanks a lot for helping LibreOffice by filling bugs and also helping to fix them!MatuÃÂ¡ Kukan committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#51819: autorecovery: fix saving password in protected documents.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

Luckily testing is something anyone can do with master builds for each component - it'd be great to get user feedback on setting a v. short (1 minute?) autosave time and doing some live editing of odt/odp/ods, doc/xls/xlsx etc. and seeing how it behaves.MatuÃÂ¡ Kukan committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-4-2":fdo#51819: autorecovery: fix saving password in protected documents.It will be available in LibreOffice 4.2.4.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

id=52392	CreatedScreenshoot with the symbols that appear, and how it's seen in the bibliographic index.Problem description: When you create a new entry in the Bibliographic database, the fields that you don't fill are autofilled with a buggy triangle symbol.Then, if you add a bibliographic entry from the database to the document, and you have an index, the symbols are shown.Appears in both 3.5.5.3 and 3.5.5.2.Steps to reproduce:1. From Tools -> Bibliographic database, create a new bibliographic entry filling only the Identifier and for example the Type.2. Click on another entry or close the database navigator.Current behavior:The newly created one will be filled by symbols where there were no data.Inserting into the document a reference to this new entry and updating a default Bibliographic Index will make appear these symbols into the index.It does not happen when adding a new bibliography entry internally to the document and not to the database.You can try to delete the "auto-filled" fields in the database, but it's difficult, you have to do from the leftiest cell to rightest, otherwise it gets filled another time.Expected behavior:Not to fill up the empty fields with symbols.Platform (if different from the browser): Browser: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0 Iceweasel/12.0 Bug also present in newer versions 3.6.x.This doesn't occur on 3.5.4.2, where a new bibliography entry created via the Table view inserts no strange characters. I will try and reproduce on later versions to confirm.I seem to recall that this was already reported somewhere, but don't know if it got fixed.AlexConfirming in 3.6.3 rc1I note however, that the problem seems to have been created by entries made with 3.5.4 or earlier, because the new entry I made in 3.5.4.2 shows up in 3.6.3rc1 with garbled data in the fields which displayed as empty in 3.5.4.2.AlexNominating for MAB, only problem is that 3.5 branch will no longer be maintained after 3.5.7 and this most probably won't be fixed for that release (which is at rc2 pending final release). This means that it will go into the 3.6.x MAB list, sigh and who knows when that will get dealt with.AlexAdding Cedric and Andras to CC.Any chance of taking a look ? Looks like something got screwed up when the bibliography database was updated in source.AlexResetting to earliest version identified as problem showing up ==> 3.5.5.3AlexThis is also a regression on 3.5.4.2 where the problem does not show up (although the garbled data entry seems to have been inserted nonetheless, see).AlexReproduced in base (open file LibOPRofile/database/biblio.odb) in my 3.6 dev tree.Seems to do that only on VARCHAR fields, not on LONGVARCHAR fields.OK, the problem is that when writing out a NULL value (a concept that the DBF file format does not support), the field in the DBF file is written as all null characters ('\0') instead of blanks ('\0x20'). It should be blanks.This happens in connectivity/source/drivers/dbase/DTable.cxx, function connectivity::dbase::ODbaseTable::UpdateBuffer, line 1826: // If the variable is bound at all? if ( !rRow.get()[nPos]->isBound() ) { // No - the next field. nByteOffset += nLen; continue; }Basically, this function makes a distinction between NULL and "not bound". This distinction is bogus in case of a new row insertion, and an unset value should be treated as a NULL is treated (that is, write out an empty string).But in the case of a row _update_, it makes sense not to touch fields that are not set (they should not be changed!).So either we parametrise UpdateBuffer to make the distinction or not, or InsertRow sets all unbound fields to NULL.I'll fix it.

Basically, I opened the document (the same one in the latest attachment) simply by double-clicking the file from the explorer and LO 3.6.0.2 displayed the row height (0.82cm) different from the original setting (0.5cm). The reason why the initial attachment did not show any flaw was due to my fault of deleting the confidential information from the document and saving it with the new row height information (and I apologize for the confusion). The new attachment is saved in the latest LO 3.5.5.3 and due to the reversion to the stable release, I do not have LO 3.6.0.2 to test out the symptom since I am unable to perform parallel installations of the two versions. Please advise if the attachment displays the symptom, otherwise I would have to revert to 3.6.0.2 to reproduce the error.With reporters New sample I see the problem as per "- FORMATTING: FILEOPEN reverts Row Height to optimum", what has been marked as DUP of.My observation is that 3.6.0.2 does not open with exact optimum row height shown when opened with 3.5.5, but with row height very close nearby that value (here: 3.6.0.2 opens with row height 8.08 mm, 3.5.5 indicates8.03 mm as optimumSo DUP for now.@Josh KimThank you for additional information!Please feel free to reopen this Bug if you find evidence that we have an independent issue here (for example: your problem still exists after Fix for.*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***

I cannot confirm a memory leak when saving, the memory comes back, sometimes it takes a while2. I can confirm a crash when saving with lots of images as the memory goes beyond 1,5 GB. Writer opens all the images in succession and does not seem to close them and giving back the memory before opening further (as seen in Process Explorer). Same when exporting to pdf.So there may be two unrelated problems. As to the second one: writer shouldn't even touch the images when saving as odt. Hard to imagine that this is hard to fix. Any hint as to a similar bug or should I file this as a new one?@taestom<>Please do not touch the dashboard ;-)Hello,I have tested version 3.6.4 with Windows 7 SP1, and bug is still there.Moving this to 3.6 MAB because 3.5 is at the of its cycle and we will be closing the meta tracker for 3.5 MAB.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Confirmed On:Version 4.1.0.0.alpha0+ (Build ID: 871712ad62bb01359c29713a148a5673e26df1a)Bodhi LinuxIs it possible that the memory leak in the example file () is related to the use of StarView Metafile (SVM) graphics (88 of the 89 included pictures)?

I can't use my odt files.(In reply to)Hello,There are very few workarounds:- to shut down LibreOffice periodically to recover the RAM,before Writer crashes,- to use some system util programs to periodically recover RAM (there are some available for Windows),- to use OpenOffice while the bug is not corrected in LibreOffice (it is what I did, I switched to OpenOffice 3.4.1; when saving a writer file with images the RAM used by soffice increases considerably, like in LibreOffice, but unlike in LibreOffice there is no memory leak: after having saved the file the amount of RAM used by soffice goes back to the initial value).Regards,M. Nallino(In reply to)Here is a detailed workaround in order to free RAM on Windows:Download "sysinternals utilities" suite from Microsoft download site.Use "RAMMap.exe" jointly with LibreOffice (keep RAMMap running).After each file save, in RAMMap go to "Empty" menu, click on "Empty Working Sets". This forces LibreOffice to release its memory ("soffice.bin" used RAM goes down to 20 MB after an "Empty Working Sets").M. NallinoThanks for the replies, I'll try that, but that's just half of the problem. The other half is that the memory comspumtion skyrockets on saving files with lot of images, is there a workaround for this? or is this another bug?(In reply to)Hello,Unfortunately there are two distinct problems:- OpenOffice up to 3.4.1 or LibreOffice up to 3.4.6 have a very bad management of images: you may copy / paste them in Writer, or just add an html link, but in all cases, when you save your file, the RAM used by the process "soffice" reaches very high values (I have a file with 127 images and, when I save it, the RAM used by soffice reaches some 1.4GB!).- LibreOffice, all 3.5.x, 3.6.x, 4.0.x versions, has another problem: one part of the amount of the RAM is not released after having saved; next time, RAM will increase from an higher bottom value and will reach an higher maximum value, and some part will not be released, and so on; after a few saves, Writer will crash.There is no workaround for the 1st problem (high RAM consumption), you just need to have a lot of RAM in your computer to avoid an extensive use of page swapping (that slows down your computer). I have used OpenOffice and LibreOffice on computers having just 1GB RAM, I have just to say that you have time to do plenty of things when Writer is in save mode. (Now my computer has 16GB of RAM, and it is no longer a problem!)For the memory leak, workarounds are to use OpenOffice 3.4.1, or LibreOffice 3.4.6, or, if you still want / need to use more recent versions of LibreOffice to free the RAM periodically by shutting down LibreOffice or by using an external memory management program.I still don't know when / if this bug will be corrected in LibreOffice, and I just hope that the bug will not appear in the next announced release of OpenOffice, the 4.0 (it might be there, if it is a library related bug, with a new release using an updated set of libraries).In that case, I would stay with OpenOffice 3.4.1 or even switch to MS Office 2013 ;-)!Of course, I would be very glad to use a reliable version of LibreOffice 3.6.x or 4.0.x, since it offers lots of functions, but, at this time, I can't.Best regards,M. Nallinonot sure why regression isn't on this one:says it worked in 3.4 and is broken in 3.5, adding regression because of this.Well this bug is quite extreme. I had assumed that if people genuinely wanted a fix - they might help out development by providing a leak trace from eg. valgrind. That takes a few minutes to run - and makes our life -incredibly- easier. If there was a trace on this bug months ago when I first saw it - I would have done some development work on it ( JFYI ).Here is how to build that - I would appreciate it if this ended up on some QA page:valgrind --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes --num-callers=50 ./soffice.bin /opt/libreoffice/tmp/CR_CM_120625.odt 2>&1 | tee /tmp/val-leak.txtThen attach /tmp/val-leak.txt for analysis. The app runs 80x slower - this is a pain in the backside - but it's just as much of a pain for me as you :-)Createdlarge memory leakAs expected it is the hideous horror of the image cache, and the horrible UNO mess around it, and the lack of sane lifecycle management, caching, well - anything really around images.

that is really really silly about our image management including the infamous "graphics cache" that ...Hello,It seems that Apache OpenOffice 4.0 has changed the way memory is managed. I have a large file (260 MB, 387 pages, 129 jpeg pictures). When I open it with OpenOffice 3.4.1, or with LibreOffice 3.6.6 (the latest version I have tested, under Windows 7), the memory used by "soffice.bin" is some 400 MB. When I open it with AOO 4.0, the memory used is some 950 MB.When I save with AOO 3.4.1 or LO 3.6.6, memory used increases up to 1500 MB (and comes back to 400 MB with AOO 3.4.1, or 600 MB with LO 3.6.6 --> here is the memory leak).However, when I save it with AOO 4.0, the memory used constantly decreases, down to some 90 MB. With future use (write / save) of AOO 4.0 memory stays in the range 90 - 125 MB, decreasing to 90 MB at each save.It seems that there is a memory release mechanism that has been used in AOO 4.0.The result is that both peak and average memory used is lower than with AOO 3.4.1 and that there is still no memory leak, unlike with LO 3.5x and further versions.Maybe the way memory is managed by AOO 4.0 could be analysed, and used in a future release of LO?Best regards, M.

This is part of an effort to make the importance of MAB reflected in priority too.still reproducible with version 4.2.1.0.0+ under Ubuntu 13.10 x86-64Best regards. JBFI can confirm a similar problem with metafiles in LibreOffice Version: 4.1.3.2 Build ID: 410m0(Build:2) on Ubuntu 13.10.For this test I created a file with 2 pages. Page 1 is covered with an imported SVG image. Page 2 is covered with an imported emf or wmf image.When only the first page with the SVG is visible, the program works normally. On every redraw the program allocates approximately 2MB of memory which is released soon afterwards.As soon as the emf/wmf image from page 2 becomes visible, the program starts allocating approximately 2MB on every redraw and this memory is never released. This soon consumes all the available memory and hangs the system with a lot processes going into "disk sleep" state, probably because LibreOffice is swapping objects in and out of memory.If I make the wmf/emf image smaller, less memory is being lost.This is what I think is going on: to render an embedded metafile a temporary raster buffer is allocated which is never released after the rendering is complete.Moving to mab4.1 () because:- 4.0 reached EOL (End Of Life)- bug confirmed in later versionif you guys still reproduce this bug under 4.2.x please move it to the mab 4.2 list () since 4.1.x is END OF LIFEStill reproducible for me with LibO 4.2.5.0.0+ under Ubuntu 14.04 x86-64Moving to MAB 4.2 list.Best regards.

When I try it an Linux x86 (32bit-rpm) the wizard works.[Reproduced] in 3.6.0.4 on Fedora 64 bit (installed from libreoffice.org)used first attachment and initial descriptionNot reproduced in 3.5.5. Therefore regressionNot reproduced in 3.3.4. Writes: "Oracle report builder required".Problem seems to be:There are a lot of tests, also with Linux, where the database is not destroyed. I tested this with 64-bit-rpm on a OpenSUSE 12.1-System. It works.Other problem with *.deb: Seems to be, that the report-builder could not be closed whithout crashing the whole LO.And another hint: When I don't close the whole LO I can reopen the database. And when I kill the LO-process (Ctrl-Alt-Esc in SuSE) I can also open the database again. The deleting of the *.odb-file happens, when the whole LO is closed in the norml way without any errormessage.FYI:Given the fact that this issue is reproducible (see), I have added it to our list of LibO 3.6 most annoying bugs ().On pc Debian x86-64, with master sources updated today, I tried to reproduce the problem by following(without creating table), I didn't succeed.Base opened normally then I could click on Table tab (but not surprising it's ok since there wasn't any table).I noticed these logs during closing anyway:warn:legacy.osl:9759:1:/home/julien/compile-libreoffice/libo/dbaccess/source/core/dataaccess/ModelImpl.cxx:926: caught an exception!in function:static bool dbaccess::ODatabaseModelImpl::commitStorageIfWriteable_ignoreErrors(const com::sun::star::uno::Reference<com::sun::star::embed::XStorage>&)type: com.sun.star.uno.RuntimeExceptionmessage: unsatisfied query for interface of type com.sun.star.io.XStream!warn:legacy.osl:9759:1:/home/julien/compile-libreoffice/libo/dbaccess/source/core/dataaccess/ModelImpl.cxx:832: ODatabaseModelImpl::commitRootStorage: could commit the storage!warn:legacy.osl:9759:1:/home/julien/compile-libreoffice/libo/unotools/source/config/configmgr.cxx:208: OSL_ASSERT: items_.empty()Createdbt + console msgs on masterI reproduced the crash (with same config than my previous comment).This time, i created a table with some lines in it, noticed these logs during first insert:warn:legacy.osl:10009:1:/home/julien/compile-libreoffice/libo/dbaccess/source/core/api/RowSetCache.cxx:851: ORowSetCache::moveWindow: m_nStartPos not smaller than m_nEndPoswarn:legacy.osl:10009:1:/home/julien/compile-libreoffice/libo/dbaccess/source/ui/browser/genericcontroller.cxx:1343: SbaTableQueryBrowser::openHelpAgent: could not get a dispatcher!Then I saved the table, launch report creation (without using wizard), then cancelled so no report.Finally I closed LO and had a crash.Sorry, the line "warn:legacy.osl:10009:1:/home/julien/compile-libreoffice/libo/dbaccess/source/ui/browser/genericcontroller.cxx:1343:SbaTableQueryBrowser::openHelpAgent: could not get a dispatcher!" appeared only when I launched report creation not during insert.I tried the same with 3.6 sources updated today, I had the same behaviour.BTW, here are my Java info:java version "1.6.0_24"OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.11.3) (6b24-1.11.3-2)OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.0-b12, mixed mode)Now there are more tests, that reproduced the bug. Problem: we can not describe the configuration by, for example, "Linux - all". In mailinglists I heard, that it works with *.deb 32bit (Ubuntu) and 64bit (Debian). An here Julien reported: crash. ()I tested with OpenSuSE 11.4, 32bit rpm - *.odb has beeen destroyed. With OpenSuSE 12.1, 64bit rpm it works. And here Sasha reported: crash. ()One day ago I had the same crash-problem with all wizards (I have not tested it before). Could you please have a look on?In my case was not a crash. All was looking correctly. But during exiting of office ODB file becomes slightly shorter. And next time this file impossible to open.Hi Sasha,what OS are you using?The problems donÂ´t occur using Windows as OS, but only using Linux (also).Linux Fedora 64 bitI have tested it now on another PC with OpenSuSE 11.4, 32bit rpm. There it works. So I had a look at the difference between the same systems, both working with KDE.The GUI in the system, which could reopen the databases, looks rather old - don't know why, but it's the same in LO 3.3.4 an this system. When I want to save or open a file an old Gnome-dialog appears. I haven't installed the whole Gnome on this machine, because I am working with KDE. Seems, that the integration in KDE won't work right.Another hint for this system: When I start LO at the shell I see: GLIBCXX_3.4.11 not found. This system hasn't all the repositories with very new software integrated.I have a 64-bit-rpm-System, where it looks like this description - and there databases could be reopened too.The system, which could not open databases, when used the report-builder, shows a integrated design to KDE. When I want to open a file ore save a file an old KDE-dialog appears - looks like the old konqueror from KDE 3. It is the first time in LO, that a system-Dialog for saving and opening appears in this system.@sasha: which GUI is on your machine?KDE 4 and Gnome 3. Reproducible on both (corruption of odb in 3.6.0)Installed using rpm files from libreoffice.org. No desktop integration modules installed. User profile is fresh.Reproduced odb corruption also on Linux Alt6 64 bit, KDE. Used the same installation files as for Fedora.Experimented also on Windows XP 32 bit with 3.6.0:After exiting LibreBase window disappears, but program remains in memory. Impossible to start office again. I need use Ctrl-Alt-Del and kill soffice.bin.Only then possible to start LibreBase again.What about odb file: during exiting of office this file changes (no propose to save changes, just silent saving). But remains openable.Cannot reproduce with freshly created embedded HSQL database with LibreOffice 3.6.0.4 (Build ID: 932b512) (official deb binaries) on Debian GNU/Linux amd64.Cannot reproduce withwith LibreOffice 3.6.0.4 (Build ID: 932b512) (official deb binaries) on Debian GNU/Linux amd64.Yes, I also already saw that effect, but I did not see a possible relation to the problem here. I will watch that more carefully.I tried to reproduce and found a crasher when closing report wizard, please see the. I wonder if it might be related.Otherwise, I can find a way to reproduce this problem. I am afraid that it is a memory corruption and it behaves different way on different systems.(In reply to)Hi Petr,what do mean with "memory corruption": main memory = ram = physical defect or a problem in the code of LO?Createdvalgrind logs on masterI retrieved Valgrind logs if it can help.This bug describes, that the creating of a report destroys *.odb-files. The only system, where this happens - as I see from the comments - is Linux with *.rpm-packages 32bit and 64bit. And it didn't happen with every system, where these packages are installed. Only person, which has reproduced and commented it here is sahsha (and)There are other problems with the wizard of the report-builder. This is reported in. The problems with the wizard seem to be problems of *.deb-packages.The bug reported here has nothing to do with the wizard. Only opening and closing of "Create Report in Design View" without saving anything is, what I make in LO-Base. I close normally without any problem Base. When I reopen at this moment the database it works - but only at this session. When I close LO in the normal way the database-file is corrupted. When I close LO by killing the process the database could be opened again.Here is the difference between those versions of Linux-rpm, which don't destroy the database by editing a report (or opening a wizard) and on the other hand, which destroy databases.The following I see on the shell, when LO works in the right way with databases:(soffice:2011): Gtk-WARNING **: /opt/libreoffice3.6/program/../ure-link/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.11' not found (required by /usr/lib64/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/engines/liboxygen-gtk.so)You see a warning on every *.rpm-version, which works with LO and base in the right way, don't destroys databases and looks a little bit like very old Gnome-desktop. The dialog for opening files in LO is an old Gnome-dialog - under KDE.This warning didn't appear at systems, which destroy the database in the way I have written in the former comments.Is the "stdlibs" rpm provided by LibreOffice installed on the affected systems?If it is, try to uninstall it.If it is not, try to install it.In all cases, please report results before/after.(In reply to)It has been installed. Databases were corrupted after closing LO.Have uninstalled it, tested - same problem.I think the version stdlibs of LO is for "old" Linux-Systems. But the systam I have is updated with all patches ...(In reply to)Drats.Exactly; but if it is installed, it is always used,even on newer systems. This can cause problems with*other* components (such as QT or GTK+ themes) thatexpect a newer stdlibs than what is distributed withLibreOffice. That's why it is recommended to installthe LO stdlibs only if necessary.(if the stdlibs on the systems are *older*than the ones distributed with LibreOffice,using the LO ones should AFAIK not hurt.)I think the "looks like a very old Gnome" that you reportis caused by the presence of LibreOffice's stdlibs:the GTK+ theme cannot be loaded. That's the meaning of thewarning you report:(soffice:2011): Gtk-WARNING **:/opt/libreoffice3.6/program/../ure-link/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version`GLIBCXX_3.4.11' not found (required by/usr/lib64/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/engines/liboxygen-gtk.so)You should get this warning if and only if the LO stdlibs are installed(on a system where the GTK themes have been compiled against a newerstdlibs than what is shipped with LO).As you were reporting that the warning is linked to presence of this bug,my hunch was that there was something about the stdlibs in LO or on thesystem that caused something to go wrong.In other words: this message not connected with this problem."Is the "stdlibs" rpm provided by LibreOffice installed on the affected systems?"Little hint: When I uninstall it on the machines, were the bug didn't appear and the GTK-Warning appears, the GTK-Warning has gone and LO uses the dialog of my system (KDE, Dolphin). Good for my eyes, but didn't solve the problem directly. Its the system, where stdlibs seems nothing to do and the dialogs look like old konqueror-dialogs of KDE - with stdlibs and without stdlibs.The bug happens under KDE and Gnome, so it isn't a connection between KDE and LO.Stephan Bergmann committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":Related fdo#52639: Do not destroy Implementations with mutex locked(In reply to)That commit addresses the crash fromupon exiting LO (and I intend to get it backported to LO 3.6.1; it is a regression introduced with the new service manager in LO 3.6.0). I consider that crash unrelated to the problem discussed in this issue, though.Stephan Bergmann committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-3-6":Related fdo#52639: Do not destroy Implementations with mutex lockedIt will be available in LibreOffice 3.6.1.after trying out a lot of things, i have to disagree with Stephan for once :)first, the corruption problem does not occur in a "dev-install"installation with symlinks; i could only reproduce it bybuilding "archive" instsets and running those; i only mentionthis because finding this out wasted a lot of time :(then it seems that the commit inactually _does_ fixthe corruption problem. i don't know exactly why that is, but myguess is that at shutdown some attempt is made to save the documentwhile the ServiceManager is being disposed, and that happened to"partially" succeed before the commit in such a way that acorrupted document was produced, while with the commit it fails completely.please somebody verify this in tinderbox builds that have the fix.(In reply to)Where could I get these builds. Is it difficult to install for somebody, who only installs *.rpm with a packagemanager?(In reply to)you can find them here:it's not obvious to tell which upload has the fix, but looking at the githashes in the *_build_info.txt it seems that this one should have the fix:***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***forgot to mention: with a 3.5.5 dbgutil build where the bug does NOT happeni get this telling assertion on shutdown: dbaccess/source/core/dataaccess/ModelImpl.cxx:937: caught an exception! in function:static bool dbaccess::ODatabaseModelImpl::commitStorageIfWriteable_ignoreErrors(const com::sun::star::uno::Reference<com::sun::star::embed::XStorage>&) type: com.sun.star.lang.DisposedException message: service manager instance has already been disposed! context: N9stoc_smgr23ORegistryServiceManagerE dbaccess/source/core/dataaccess/ModelImpl.cxx:843: ODatabaseModelImpl::commitRootStorage: could commit the storage!in 3.6, with the fix i get a slightly different assertionabout some XStream interface missing, and without the fixi get no assertion on shutdown.that's why i think something tries to save the document on shutdown,and this has always failed until the new service manager in 3.6.i wonder if _trying_ to save the document at this stage in shutdownis a bug by itself, and what to do about that;Lionel can think about this problem if he likes :)I have verified, that it works now with Version 3.6.1.0+ (Build ID: cd656ac).The problem with the wizards has also gone.Thank you, it took a load of my mind.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***

Same behavior appears with the disk space button.Steps to reproduce:1. Double-click on the installer2. Choose custom installation3.

That being said, I can confirm this. Windows 8LibreOffice 3.5.7 (our version field is oldest version that we can confirm the problem)Setting to:NewCritical - inability to install essentially - a lot of people want to install to a separate drive and this only allows it if you install the entire suite. This being said, unlike Microsoft Office or other suites, each component is part of a larger individual product so not installing one thing is not saving you much at all in terms of space. None the less I think critical is appropriate.HighestMost Annoying BugAdditional info that makes it even worse:If you select your separate drive prior to deselecting a component, it actually installs to the appropriate drive but then it's a corrupt install and you can't run it.Thanks for reporting!Well, in 4.2 there will be no possibility to (misguidedly) pick and choose among "components" (meaning Writer, Calc, Draw etc) any more. Which is good. Despite the marketing, LibreOffice is not a "suite" of separate programs. It has never worked properly anyway to pick and choose among these "components"; leaving out some "component" has made some use cases of other "components" fail, etc.But as such, this bug is still present, if one de-selects on of the (truly) optional components, the possibility to change installation location disappears.Could someone test if this is still an issue in 4.1?Tor Lillquist is right.see:basically this means that this issue will not be present anymore in future LibO releases.I change status to RESOLVED WONTFIX

In all probability the problem was caused by that conversion (missing exported symbols, most likely).No. But neither were the files.Huh?***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***David Ostrovsky committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#53070 fix access violationThe patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

If ok, I can push it on master.As Julien also reproduced on Debian, updating OS/platform and changing subject line.Alex@JulienHave there been any recent changes in section height calculation that might have inadvertently caused this ?Alex(In reply to)By looking at the git history of the file reportdesign/source/filter/xml/xmlExport.cxx, it's like this since the beginning (09/07/2007).BTW, could you indicate how did you create this report? Did you use a specific option for example?(In reply to)Ah OK.I didn't create it, it was supplied by someone from the French user/discussion list with a problem they were attempting to solve.In LO 3.5.5, the same report causes a Java AWT thread attachment error on MacOSX, and refuses to load. I've opened a separate bug report for that because it is Mac specific (no-one else could reproduce it on other OSes, and Lionel doesn't have a Mac to test on, so I put Thorsten on CC). Alex(In reply to)My money is on "for some reason, the control in xFixedLine, when it was *created* / loaded, was not attached to a section, while it should have been".It could be for a reason similar to what happened in, but that is just a wild guess.Alex: I'll try your file tonight with 3.5 and 3.6 sources.Just thinking for possible changes which could have happened between different versions:- section management- exception managementAbout your, what's the fdo?With 3.5 sources updated yesterday and 3.6 sources updated today, I reproduced the pb with an equivalent stacktrace.I submited the patch for reviewing (see)There is something wrong with fixed lines in reportbuilder reports for a long time...

id=52177	When writing a .odt document on Libreoffice Writer in Ubuntu 12.04 with Gnome 3 (using Gnome Shell, not Unity), if word autocompletion occurs too fast, the whole Gnome 3 environment freezes, with keyboard not respondig (LEDs don't change state when pressing those keys) leaving as only alternative to force shutdown of the laptop computer using power button and restart the entire operating system, possibly loosing lattest changes in document and risking to filesystem corruption.My graphic card is an Intel HD integrated card and mi processor Intel Core i7. I have no problem with this on Ubuntu 12.04 gnome shell with LibO 3.5.4.Perhaps some kind of driver bug.You could try reporting it to Ubuntu directly on Launchpad.I also have no problems with Ubuntu 12.04 and gnome-shell 3.4.1 and LibO 3.6.0Not positive what the issue is but you might at least start here:

The stock Mint 12 comes with LO 3.4.4 and debug symbols, but I didn't have a problem there.Not an option I'm afraid, too little disk space, and too slow a machine for building - it takes approximately 2 days for my LO build to complete on that machine (single processor, 756Mb RAM), and that's even when using ccache to speed things up :-/AlexManaged to test on 3.5.4.2 Ubuntu PPA with debug symbolsProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.btdbaccess::ORowSet::impl_restoreDataColumnsWriteable_throw (this=0x20ec520) at /build/buildd/libreoffice-3.5.4/dbaccess/source/core/api/RowSet.cxx:12591259 /build/buildd/libreoffice-3.5.4/dbaccess/source/core/api/RowSet.cxx: Aucun fichier ou dossier de ce type. in /build/buildd/libreoffice-3.5.4/dbaccess/source/core/api/RowSet.cxx(gdb) (gdb) cContinuing.[Thread 0x7fffdca8f700 (LWP 7231) exited][Thread 0x7fffd8a49700 (LWP 7226) exited][Thread 0x7fffdc28e700 (LWP 7222) exited][Thread 0x7fffe45dd700 (LWP 7212) exited][Thread 0x7fffed521700 (LWP 7207) exited][Thread 0x7fffe4dde700 (LWP 7216) exited]Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.Hmm, so this is now reproducible for me in 3.5.4.2 as well, resetting version number back to earlier version.AlexApparently somewhere in here :void SAL_CALL ORowSet::moveToCurrentRow( ) throw(SQLException, RuntimeException){ ::connectivity::checkDisposed(ORowSet_BASE1::rBHelper.bDisposed); ::osl::ResettableMutexGuard aGuard( *m_pMutex ); checkPositioningAllowed(); if ( !m_pCache->m_bNew && !m_bModified ) // nothing to do if we're not on the insertion row, and not modified otherwise return; if ( rowDeleted() ) // this would perhaps even justify a RuntimeException .... // if the current row is deleted, then no write access to this row should be possible.

The three previous tables display fine.The bug also reminds me of a similar problem we had a while ago with navigatingthe tree view listing of Basic macros which come pre-installed with LO. In thatbug, if you clicked anywhere in the middle of the list and started navigating,there was no crash, but if you started from the first entry of the list, acrash could be systematically reproduced after traversing down through the listafter about the third or fourth entry.Alex(In reply to)Am looking at doing that now :-)Eventually, with any luck :-))AlexPerhaps a dup of fdo#37529 ()?

id=54157	This is the meta issue to track the most annoying bugs in LibreOffice 3.7.x releases. It helps developers to concentrate on bugs that are most important for users. Also it helps users to be aware of potential problems.If anyone wants to raise a bug as âmost annoyingâ for the release, please add the ID of that bug to the field âDepends onâ, and donât forget to leave a comment here that explains in a few words why that bug should be privileged.For details, criteria and further instructions, please see A first nomination: â- CRASH on launch when loading local libiconv.2.dylib ("liblangtag.0.dylib requires version 8.0.0 or later, but libiconv.2.dylib provides version 7.0")â.This bug makes it impossible to test the daily builds on MacOS X.I added all who were in CC for "- LibreOffice 3.6 most annoying bugs" to CC here, please feel free to remove yourself if you do not want to get info concerning latest 3.7 MAB.Add "- CRASH - opening database report" - RegressionAdd "- MAILMERGEe-mail as PDF sends damaged documents", what makes Mailmerge assistant unusable for e-mail as PDFRemoved("CRASH - opening database report") again, because it is now already listed as an LibO 3.5 most annyoing bug.Nominating: PRINTING comments in Writer inline or WYSIWYGIt's not bug, it's an enhancement, but since I saw you are working on Writer comments in 3.7, this would be nice bug to solve.Lo can't print comments WYSIWYG or inline, it adds them to page end or document end which makes it less usable since you have to search text for line on which comment is reffering (you have to count lines, there is no marker).I was in need of this feature today since I printed revision of contract on which I had a lot of comments.LO has great commenting system (same as Word) but horrible comment printing which should get this much needed upgrade.drop- move it to 3.5 MABs where it belongs; the lowest version with the bug should be used.Added- âCRASH when accessing "General" tab of file "Properties" dialog ("File > Properties...") for any saved documentâAddingHybrid PDF export are corruptedadding- LOdev 3.7 won't install. Error 1935. this affects 24 Sep build. previous 3 buils did install.Adding- âLetter spacing and âexpand single wordâ do not work anymoreâ.Not the most terrible bug in the world, but a blameful regression, which would make MS and AOO folks laugh at us and our users angry with us, introduced between 2012-09-20 and 2012-09-24.Adding- âUI: Hang when accessing âInsert > Manual Break...ââ.Endless hang, at least on Mac OS X. Introduced between 27th and 30th September.Add "- CRASH when create or modify Character Style or Paragraph Style"Add "- UI: Find Bar incomplete, empty, input pane is missing". Ease workaround using "Find & Replace", but no working 'Find' is a serious limitation. Confirmation for Mac / Linux still missing.(In reply to)Really added it. Now also confirmed for Linux and Mac OS.I add "- EDITING: CRASH when Format Cells (menu and Context menu)"; unthinkable to release without possibility to format cellsAdded- âCRASH when accessing âTools > Outline Numbering...ââ.Makes complete outline numbering feature inaccessible. Regression introduced between 2012-09-27 and 2012-10-04.For the record:Markus Mohrhard has added- âsaving with password removes all contentâ. (Thank you, Markus, for emphasizing this important issue!)Adding 2 master regressions. Both have been git bisected and first bad commit identified.1.- FILEOPEN PPTX image background rendered incorrectly. Currently reproducible in Windows, but not Linux. (No Mac to test)2.- FILEOPEN existing document: 2 columns Table of contents exceeds page width. Affect both Windows and Linux.Add "- CRASH when closing specific .odg files", many Drawings affected!are we going to rename this meta-issue as LibO 4.0 MAB?We have no builds with that Version, no 4.0 Version in Bugzilla, so currently please leave this one as 3.7 MAB tracker.Please adapt all relevant tools to 4.0 (renaming or creating new ones) simultaneously after that has been reasoned and some notes have been left in the Wiki.Although the latest 4.0 code is simply further development of the Master, it might be appropriate to create a new 4.0 Master Version for Bugzilla and leave 3.7.0.0.alpha0+, because for most users it will be worrying to have lots of bugs for Version 4.0 (due to vrsion picker) without any 4.0 Version mentioned in the comments.I add "- FILEOPEN particular .docx shows all text frames filling complete page size and more", what makes lots of .docx unusableI add "- No WINDOWS daily Master builds available for QA"Added- âLOdev 3.7.0.0.alpha0 daily build does not start at all: system liblangtag.1.dylib not foundâ.This makes the current master builds for Mac OS X completely worthless: I can not do any QA work with master builds as long as this bug exists.I add "- CRASH when scroll down on (Writer) HELP contents - Common Help Topics - General Information - General Glossary"Added*- âUI: Visual glitches with the new Widget Layout: Buttons cut off in âInsert Tableâ dialogâ*- âUI: Visual glitches with the new Widget Layout: cursor does not blink in âNameâ field of âInsert Tableâ dialogâBoth bugs seem really minor, but I add them following a suggestion by CaolÃ¡n McNamara. Similar visual glitches appear in many other dialog windows, and there is a chance that fixing these two bugs will improve the look of the other dialogs, too. This is why these two bugs are quite important, and are added here.**** Renamed to âLibreOffice 3.7/4.0 most annoying bugsâ *****Because LibreOffice 3.7 has been renamed to LibreOffice 4.0 now, we have to adapt this meta bug report accordingly. But it would be a bit irritating if we would simply rename it to âLibreOffice 4.0 most annoying bugsâ, because it has started for version 3.7, and all comments talk about â3.7â. On the other hand it would be (IMHO) overkill to create a new, separate âLibreOffice 4.0 most annoying bugsâ report; this approach would (falsely!) suggest that 3.7 and 4.0 were different versions and branches.Therefore the best solution (there is no perfect one!) seems to follow Rainerâs suggestion atto rename the present meta bug to âLibreOffice 3.7/4.0 most annoying bugsâ.One could argue that this name is a bit irritating in itself, but this timethe irritation has the advantage to remind us (if we ever manage to forget it ;-)of the version history, i.e. of 4.0 being the continuation of 3.7 ...I hope that everybody can live with this solution :-)Added- âMac OSX Daily installation package to small and invalidâ.Tinderbox 27 seems to produce invalid daily builds.Adding some confirmed regressions:*- VIEWING of particular DRAW OLE object incomplete, pixel picture in it is missing*- OLE Pictures are not displayed*- Font list is unsorted in 'insert special character' dialog*- Wrong text rotation in SVG Export (rotated text appears as non-rotated)Still UNCONFIRMED:*- UI: Cell formatting dialog shows characters as squares for some languagesI add "- UI: Master pages styles change view to "Default" instead of being applied", because a very basic function is broken what makes impress more or less unusable for creation of new presentations.I added. I'm afraid it's also a bit of an enhancement, but a very much needed one.Cropping in LibreOffice Writer is pretty much impossible the way it's currently implemented, and someone actually showed this issue to me as the reason they don't use LibreOffice.Removed- please add MAB's to the open tracker of the lowest version they are found in: in this case 3.5 (at). This helps us have a good view of bugs specific to each versionI add "- Wizards for Fax and Letter do not work", I think we can not ship 4.0 with such a visible bug.I hesitated quite a while to add "- CRASH when FILESAVE .doc as .html", but its a crash and not a too exotic action causing the crash.I add "- EDITING: CRASH when manage conditional formatting - double click range"Add: crash when creating a Table of Contents.Createdread error on picturesComment onread error on picturesnot a .txt, not a patch, seems to be here accidently, I will open a nw Bug for thisAdd "- UI: Conditional Formatting for cells shown incorrectly and and incompletely in CF dialog", we can't ship 4.0 without ability to edit CFAdd bug 56058 "FILEOPEN: LibreOffice cannot open .docx file in strict variant"This should be solved soon, because with release of Word 2013 such files will be produced from those who care of standards.I add "- EDITING CRASH in menu 'Format - Conditional Formatting - Contition - Condition'", looks like a blockerI add "- BUGZILLAASSISTANT: Submit fails with error message "It looks like you didn't come from the right page ..."".

Not a bug.AddIf you select "impress remote" menu item by mistake and don't have android device to connect, the dialog window never close and you have to kill Impress loosing your last editing.I add "- FILESAVE as .docx: loss of page background picture (watermark)" because of data loss.I nominate "- [CRASH] new document, close without saving crashes Impress" because of the basic function to 'close without saving'... following I need to add this bug in mab4.0 and set priority to 'Highest' and 'Critical'.Add "- FILEOPEN .xlsx: "IF" condition not calculated": very basic function, additional functions might be affected.I add "- Extensions Update fails with error "Cannot create folder"": it's a serious problem that LibO lost ability for Extensions update.Would like to suggest addingThis regression results in significant visual differences where a user has depended on derived formats for calculated cells. The intention in 4.0.0.0B2 is obviously to follow what happened in 3.6.n.n as the expected derived formats do appear when sheet layout is changed - see issue report for details(In reply to)Yup, it sounds like an important regression.(In reply to)Really added ;-)I nominate"Copy and paste chart fails if the source sheet does not have the default name" as it make impossible to cleanly move a chart if the sheet has been renamed.Nominating: cannot open .odt files on CIFS (Windows share) filesystem.Add- create new Impress/Draw document, add slide/page, close without saving crashes Impress, Draw.Add- Install fails if .NET Framework 4.0 (Client) is not presentI nominate: links in spreadsheets broken by default (they don't update even if the user clicks yes to update them)Adding- VIEWING: Pages do not have a drop shadow.

Still valid for LO 4.0RC1.Add "- Wizards for Fax and Letter do not launch", very visible and might affect many users!I nominate- Paragraph styles line spacing does not stick. This bug is a very annoying regression which is preventing me from being able to upgrade from version 3.4.6. It is also very simple to duplicate.59516 = the MySQL native connector do not longer install with Windows 7&8,who uses LO as frontend to Mysql is out of buisinessI nominate "- [FILEOPEN][FILESAVE]: General Error while opening/closing .odt files" because of an error message every time you open/save an ODT file (Mac osx only)I add "- RTL VIEWING: Increasing size of dialogs to right or bottom causes artifacts": very fixible and makes new "resizable dialogs" feature more or less unusable for RTL UIAdd- Copy range cells and paste special as RTF in Writer does not workI add "- EDITING: CRASH when paste in outline view after SLIDESHOW". It seems that not many users are affected, but a crash is crash!addingit seems quite a serious regressionI'm nominating. Footnotes with headers enabled in a large document make it unusable and will cause it to crash. This bug is keeping me from being able to upgrade from version 3.4.6 and is very likely related towhich was recently fixed.Added. User profile is not imported to version 4.0.0. Users expect this AND nearly all users are effected. Hence I expect a lot of user complaints and a bad press, if this bug is not corrected.add sdremote deadlock:- it's pretty annoying to kill soffice remotely[sic] while presenting.I nominate "- LibreLogo: view -> toolbars: LibreLogo has name "Add-on 1"" because you can't find LibreLogo with it's proper name in the toolbar list.

id=52226	While working on a .docx or .xlsx file, pictures are replaced with "read error" message when opening file.Steps to reproduce are given here::1- started docx document in Office 2010 on Windows 7, added text, a fewpictures, and table of contents.2- opened docx in LO 3.5.4 on Mac Lion. Made various edits and added about 13jpeg photos using Insert > Picture > From File in various places in thedocument. I did crop one of the images in LO and edited a few with "Edit withExternal Tool" (Mac Preview rotation) and all seemed okay from those. 3- re-Saved the file as docx and dropboxed it4- re-opened the docx file at work today and got the following results. Probably all recent comments on this bugare also about the same bug. [Quotation fromcontinued: Results after step 4:]* MS Office 2010 will not open it now and says it has an error.* Libreoffice 3.5.4 on Windows 7 will open it, but there are read-error notices where the pictures should be. * I also notice that the file is 4MB, which would be small considering that manypictures. They would have been a few MB each. * Also, the few images that were added originally in step 1 are still present andokay. All other images are missing with read-error.----@okko7:Thank you very much for moving the discussion to a new bug report! I will see if I can reproduce (and therefore confirm) this new report ...(Changed 'Component' to 'LibreOffice', because not only Writer is affected, but also Calc, and maybe Impress).Another symptom of the horrific design behind image management.CreatedSample .docx file with missing images, created with LibO 3.5.5.3REPRODUCIBLE withLibreOffice 3.5.5.3 (Build ID: 7122e39-92ed229-498d286-15e43b4-d70da21), German langpack installed, on MacOS X 10.6.8 (Intel).To test, I used the steps given by Geoff King in:My results are even worse: I added 2 PNG images and one JPEG image to the page, and all three are lost: I only see grey rectangles with the broken image symbol and the red notice "Read-Error". The images also lost the wrap settings I added to them -- both the direction of wrap-around (Before or After or Parallel ...) and the distance for text from the image margins are missing, all reset to default values. Only the position and size of all three images seems to be correct.Updated Status and SummaryAlso REPRODUCIBLE with LibreOffice 3.6.0.1 (Build ID: 73f9fb6), German langpack installed, again on MacOS X 10.6.8 (Intel).Creating and editing an .docx file following the steps cited ingives me exactly the same results as said in.However, at least for now I can't reproduce the bug with Impress, so AFAIK Writer (.docx) and Calc (.xlsc) files are affected. (But maybe someone else can manage to reproduce this with Impress, to, so keep on testing ;-)I seem to have a similar problem on Ubuntu 12.10 with LO 3.6.2.2 : Since I started exchanging .odt documents between my system and a Windows system with Microsoft Office, using tracked changes and comments.Every so often my images disappear with the message "Read-Error" and the broken image icon.Version 3.6.0.2 (Build ID: 360m1(Build:102)) on Mint Linux Maya, same problem.BIG problem!FYI using Version 3.6.0.2 (Build ID: 360m1(Build:102)) on Mint Linux, problem remains.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Issue is still present with Version 4.0.0.3.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***It looks like the problem is not specifically related to autosaving, but to saving in odt in general, since a similar problem was reported inand.

I open them using LibreOffice and save them again as docx, usually using a different name, open them again : images have disappeared, either giving a read error or just an empty box ( I have observed both problems within the same file). When I open the resulting docx file with a zip programm and have a look in the mdeia folder I can see actually many imageXX.png or .emf files that either only contain a white rectangle or are corrupted. I have done this very fast after opening, I would guess before autosave has saved, the problem does not occur, so I actually also believe that this has something to do with the autosaving. This is a very annoying bug as everytime I return a document to a colleague all of the images are lost. I hope that this will be resolved rapidly.

Please confirm if this is a mistake.Perhaps it was mistakenly indicated by someone reporting the bug for 3.5.5.3. As I've learn, the version indicated should be the first version the bug is noticed.

Previously I had been able to reproduce this issue with a docx file easily, but after trying today I was unable to reproduce the problem and am keen to find out if this was a fluke or not. Tested on Win8 64bit.Thanks a lot for looking into this matter, Rob.I hope this time, the bug will get tackled sooner. Unlike my original report (), which went unnoticed for over 4 months and in the meanwhile the file from the download link had been automatically removed. ^^(30 days no download)I reuploaded the unchanged files toThe bug with the read error DOES exist in the official Pre-Release Version:----Version: 4.1.0.1Build ID: 1b3956717a60d6ac35b133d7b0a0f5eb55e9155OS: Windows 7, 64bit (but with the x86 executables, as the only ones available)Language: German for both----The saved and broken png-Image (rename *.docx to *.zip and open \word\media\) consists as before only of the first 8 bytes, a part of the png header, instead of the 8034 bytes of the original png.I padded the original png with zeros at the end to about 16KiB (i.e. all the same logical files and sizes, but physical filesize is bigger.) and when the changed document - removed/added a space somewhere - is saved, the picture gets saved without the zeros at the end, i.e. the filesize is read/computed from the png header before saving. () Therefore, it's not the physical file that is kept!Tracking the pn RAM andng contents/datastructure i debugging the program step by step should reveal, why only the first 8 bytes are saved. My guess for the bug:Overwriting or not setting the stored file length or using/setting/computing the wrong value. (including the one that is calculated from the png-header informations)I don't have enough time in the next weeks/months to setup the LibreOffice development tools and look into the source code, but if you can provide me a download link to the next binaries (english only would be OK), I can test it again on my PC for sure.Sry for the misplacement, it should read as follows:---Tracking the png contents/datastructure in RAM and debugging the program step by step should reveal, why only the first 8 bytes are saved.---I'll try to help but am not a coder on the project, apologies if I gave that impression. The debugging method suggested is probably beyond me right now (in skill and available time). Looking at the example files you've provided though, it certainly does look as though the PNG file only consists of the PNG signature as described here:(confirmed by loading the file in a hex editor and it matches perfectly).Have confirmed this does still occur in 4.1.0.1 under both of the methods described above.To re-iterate...METHOD 1:Ensure Save AutoRecovery information is on, and set to save every 1 minute to make testing easier.Open an ODT document with an image, save as DOCX format.Add a space to the document text.Wait until the automatic recovery save is performed.Save the DOCX file.Once re-opened the images will be missing.METHOD 2:Open an ODT document with an image, save as DOCX format.Export a PDF document, either using the button in the toolbar or the File > Export as PDF menu option.Add a space to the document text.Save the DOCX file.Once re-opened the images will be missing.This behaviour occurs when when Save AutoRecovery information is switched off.It should be noted I did not get consistent results with how many images were not displayed. In one of my first tests, all images were removed. In subsequent tests, just the image on the first page was removed.After reading, that no file specific content is saved and the 8 bytes are exactly the png file signature, I tried something else.Instead of a png file in the MS docx file I used a JPEG file (saved as such inside the docx * ) and got interesting results:When a read error occurs, the JPEG file is now an empty 8 bytes PNG file! The file name stays the same and only the file extension is changed to png. This means in my case, the PDF export most probably replaces a pointer/reference or the file content and overwrites it with an empty png datastructure.Files of the experiments can be found at.I see two (relatively) simple solutions to this problem:- Find the address of the JPEG datastructure in RAM and track it and all its references/pointers/members/fields. One of these gets changed when it shouldn't and you have the culprit codeline.- (As workaround) Make a deep copy of the complete, currently displayed document and use this for auto-save and pdf export. The PDF in my experiments was exported correctly.Please inform some other developers, who could work on this issue as it is really annoying having to keep a manual backup of all files, when working together with someone who uses MS Office with docx as standard file format and the Office Version might not be able to open odt files.* rename *.docx to *.zip and go to /word/media/ in the archivemoving this bug from the mab3.6 list to the mab4.0 list since 3.6.x is EOL and bug is confirmed in 4.0.x and 4.1.x releases.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***(This is an automated message.)Setting priority to highest as this is a 4.0 MAB.

It probably happened during autosaves. The file has about 110 images, a mixture of svm and png.The missing images are represented as "<draw:image xlink:href=""><text:p/>" and the images also disappeared from the Pictures folder.This is with LO 4.1.1.2 running on Windows XP.I have not been able to reproduce the problem.I just came across this issue with most png images in a docx file, using Writer 4.1.5.1 (Build ID: e0a1805d063a472a7b281ae3977a26d42a48b20).Moving this issue to MAB 4.1 as 4.0 reached its EOL a while ago.The document in issue in 46547 now makes my LibreOffice write crash.SummaryThis bug has been confirmed in several versions on many platforms.gives steps used to reproduce with worse results than reported in description, andconfirms that those steps work in a different version.reports a problem exchanging .odt documents between systems;suggests the problem is with odt rather than autosaving and gives steps to reproduce problems with odt.reports problems with docx files and believes the problem is related to autosave.gives 2 methods of reproducing bugs when changing between odt and docx.reports problems with JPEG files becoming empty 8 byte png files and suggests two ideas for solutions.reports problems with ods files as well.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***still reproducible under Win7x64 using LibO 4.2.3.3 and 4.3.0.0.alpha1+Build ID: a1dd961c3093f5f7624e4d1f2240e9120fd13f23TinderBox: Win-x86@39, Branch:master, Time: 2014-05-06_11:47:48moving to mab4.2 list since 4.1.x is END OF LIFEAs a professional engineer I write many reports and most have the need for images. A picture is worth ....Because of this persistent bug I and many of my colleagues have given up using LO. I am an advocate of open source and I am keenly disappointed that this major bug has not been even allocated to anyone, let alone resolved.Like many things a bug often produces illogical results that manifest themselves differently in different circumstances. The only way I have found to make LO probably produce a report with images is to have all images saved somewhere, together with a decent picture viewer, and then to write the text leaving sufficient space on a page to accomodate the images later, but not in their correct position of course. Once all the text is in place and I have a saved docx then I re-open and insert each picture in its appropriate place, only ever moving forward in the document and ensuring the picture does not cause leaps from page to page. Fortunately the default wrap aids this process. Also make sure any page headings, footers, numbering and the like are done before putting in any images.. Then export ASAP as a pdf, which seems pretty reliable, certainly before you save... As you may imagine this process is pretty tiresome and a degree stressful. If I need to make further modifications then I use the Serif PagePlus publication software as that allows import of pdfs and subsequent re-export as pdf.From my experiences any deviation or similar that causes some significant structural change in the document seems to create a finite probability of one or more images being lost. I am not convinced this is just an autosave problem because of evidence without it. It is perhaps a possibility however that on occasion autosave does make changes, but it may be more likely that the damage is done already. But because the affected pages were not being visibly present it was not noticed that going back a bit and re-editing actually caused the problem. It is also likely that there is more than one error.Just to add to the story this 'image leak' problem occurs also when I am using a doc or an odt file. Sometimes it does not leak, but in the next hour my hopes are again dashed. I have never seen it happen on a one page doc with one image.Apologies for the lengthy message. I have really tried to use LO but my patience is wearing mighty thin. Please, please do something.This explanation hit the nail on the head. I agree and have been steering people like myself who use images in their docs away from LO for this very reason. It simply canât be trusted. And like this person stated, IMMEDIATELY exporting to a PDF is the only way to ensure the desired result â¦ but then no more editing without starting over at the beginning.(As a note, some functions in Tables have similar inconsistencies. Iâve written about this before, but had less than desirable results.)I do hope a copy of this note goes to every officer in the LO organization. Sadly.Otherwise LO is very good.From:Sent: âThursdayâ, âMayâ â8â, â2014 â3â:â46â âPMTo: Croil HunteronfromAs a professional engineer I write many reports and most have the need forimages. A picture is worth ....Because of this persistent bug I and many of my colleagues have given up usingLO. I am an advocate of open source and I am keenly disappointed that thismajor bug has not been even allocated to anyone, let alone resolved.Like many things a bug often produces illogical results that manifestthemselves differently in different circumstances. The only way I have found to make LO probably produce a report with images isto have all images saved somewhere, together with a decent picture viewer, andthen to write the text leaving sufficient space on a page to accomodate theimages later, but not in their correct position of course. Once all the textis in place and I have a saved docx then I re-open and insert each picture inits appropriate place, only ever moving forward in the document and ensuringthe picture does not cause leaps from page to page. Fortunately the defaultwrap aids this process. Also make sure any page headings, footers, numberingand the like are done before putting in any images.. Then export ASAP as apdf, which seems pretty reliable, certainly before you save... As you mayimagine this process is pretty tiresome and a degree stressful. If I need tomake further modifications then I use the Serif PagePlus publication softwareas that allows import of pdfs and subsequent re-export as pdf.From my experiences any deviation or similar that causes some significantstructural change in the document seems to create a finite probability of oneor more images being lost. I am not convinced this is just an autosave problem because of evidence withoutit. It is perhaps a possibility however that on occasion autosave does makechanges, but it may be more likely that the damage is done already. But becausethe affected pages were not being visibly present it was not noticed that goingback a bit and re-editing actually caused the problem. It is also likely thatthere is more than one error.Just to add to the story this 'image leak' problem occurs also when I am usinga doc or an odt file. Sometimes it does not leak, but in the next hour my hopesare again dashed. I have never seen it happen on a one page doc with oneimage.Apologies for the lengthy message. I have really tried to use LO but mypatience is wearing mighty thin. Please, please do something.You are receiving this mail because: You are on the CC list for the bug.FWIW there's a reasonable chance this is fixed in 4-2-5/4.3.0I am sad to report that with the latest version downloaded yesterday that the problem with images disappearing is still present.I have tried using links instead to embedding images but with the same result.After saving when I come back and reopen my presentation the link shows but does not display a picture. If I duplicate the slide the image link works and the picture displays. When I close and return the link may or may not work. Or maybe some other link does not work. It is random. So- embedded images disappear at random. Linked images disappear at random.I am sad. I will have to use the product from Redmond Washington to get my work done. Running on Windows 8.1 will presently try on Opensuse and see if the results are better. If there is any change in the behavior I will post a note here.Hi BryanWhich version exactly did you test this on?CheersVersion: 4.2.4.2Build ID: 63150712c6d317d27ce2db16eb94c2f3d7b699f8 is what is on my laptop.I just now started L.O. and opened my presentation. Once again most of the links display pictures but some do not. The ones that do not display are different than the ones that did not display when I last opened the presentation.When I first started trying to build a presentation I embedded pictures only to have the pictures disappear entirely. With links at least the link info is there and I can duplicate the slide and have it work until the next time I save. then it is random as to what works and what does not the next time I open the presentation.Thanks Bryan.We will be able to test this with 4.2.5 really soon an check if CaolÃ¡n was right.CaolÃ¡n, can we have more details about your assumption?Followingand usingI still reproduce the problem with LO 4.2.5.2.To reproduce:1. open the attached document2. change it (add a space)3. save it (as ODT)4. save as DOCX - WITHOUT CHANGING5. close the document6. open the DOCX version: images are missing(In reply to)Simple to reproduce - also with 4.3.0.2thanksUseful comment on role of autosaveComment with summary of some of the casesI've seen the problem recently with a writer document and a presentation.

Not..As I've written somewhere else in one of the many occurrences of this problem:Knowing that there are various in memory copies of a document, and in Impress maybe related to various views (side panel, normal view, slide sorter, ..) it may be well possible that there is a problem in synchronising those copies.This is supported by some other comments too.This will help to _not_ reproduce the problem ;) ... but alas neither is a guaranty that it won't happen, nor does it help as a reliable solution to do reproduce it..hmm, mywas meant forI can reproduce #41 so I will fix thatCaolan McNamara committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":Resolves: fdo#52226 swap in graphics on .docx and .rtf exportThe patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

I haven't had the occasion to test this yet, but do so as soon as possible. Out of curiority: Can you explain in a few words what that bug was about and maybe a bit about the magic you did to solve it? Thanks again!Createdscreenshot: reproduced in 4.3.1.1Hi all,This issue is not fixed. Today I reproduce in version 4.3.1.1 Win7, when I was trying to translate the LibreOffice 4.2 Guide in Writer:It seems images lost at the time when LO is saving auto-recovery info while you are editing the file *at the same time*. Set auto-recovery intevel to 1 minute to observe the lost of images (as I said, you have to keep editing when LO is auto-saving.)The patch is surely included in version 4.3.1.1, as it was build on 07-Aug-2014 11:20. So the patch may not solve the problem.Thanks!By the way, I do not reproduce in any way in version 4.1.6.2 release. In 4.3.1.1 it's very easy to reproduce. It blocks users from editing files with many images in it. Seems like a regression in 4.3.Should a new bug report be filed?please do not reopen bugs, file new ones, especially in a case like this where there multiple problems and a huge number of comments@Kevinif you open a new report please put the link to this one under "See Also"(In reply to)I filedto report the problem I reproduce in 4.3.1.1.
id=55413	I open a complex workbook with 21 spreadsheets liked to each other with formulas and it opens and works in LibreOffice 3.5.6. I can save, close and re-open with no problems.When work on the the same workbook in LibreOffice 3.6.2, save it, close it and re-open the same document a number of the formulas change as an extra line is added into the sheets during the save/open process.This breaks all the relative referencing in the cells and looks like an extra line has been added.This makes the 3.6.2 update useless. Could you please attach a test document showing the issue?CreatedThe enclosed document is an example of what happens when opening a document and re-saving in LibreOffice 3.6.xI have found this problem exists in 3.6.1 and 3.6.2I have not tested this in 3.6.0.The problem does not exist in 3.5.6 and I can open the same spreadsheet and it does not add an extra line close the the top of the sheet.I removed many sheets in the workbook and the problem is still present.I plan to try removing more data to see if any other factors are a cause.This is a drawing file and not a calc file. Are you maybe talking about a problem inside draw or impress?CreatedThis attachement shows the worksheet openen in 3.6, then saved and re-openedThe following attachment shows a sheet opening in 3.6 saved under a different file name and then re-opened. It adds and extra line in the spreadsheet and line 33.This is still a odg file! IF you want to save a calc file use ODS and not ODG.Comment onThis attachement shows the worksheet openen in 3.6, then saved and re-openedBy adding comments to line 33 and line 34 seems to stop the addition of an extra line at 32. I wonder if some has damaged the file causing the erratic behaviorCreatedAttachement of the spreadsheet after an open and save in 3.5 then re-open and re-save in 3.6This the spreadsheet that will open fine and line 33 is the word Name, after opening and saving in 3.6 the word name is now on line 36.CreatedAfter a re-save in 3.6 seems to have gained some linesThis is the after saving in 3.6 Name is now on line 36 the only change was open and save with different name.Changing the contents of Cells A31, A32, A33 and A34 seemed to solve the problem.Just testing this on the main document with the work-around.Yep, that worked. Something in the spreadsheet caused LibreOffice to think that an extra line existed somewhere between line 32 and line 35.and when I remove the comments in row 32 and row 33 the problem comes back and an extra line is added at row 32.This just rather random but reproducible.I will leave using LibreOffice 3.6.x as this will cause problems.In LibreOffice 3.6.1.2.Create a new spreadsheet.Fill rows 2 to 15 with a series starting with 35 and going up to 50.Insert a row and keep inserting rows until the number 35 is on row 35.Save the sheet and close it.Re-open the sheet, the number 35 is now on row 37.Now that is a problem.Just followed the way to repoduce the problem as described inin LibreOffice version 3.6.2.2.After reopen the file there was not added an extra line.So maybe this issue is solved now?I have downloaded and test 3.6.2 and the issue is still present.Open the original file and save it with a different file name then open the new file the extra line is still added creating a problem with the formulas in the spreadsheet.Release 3.6.2 does not solve the problem.Thanks for the update.I have re-tested the method used and can not reproduce the problem.I can open the spreadsheet uploaded save it with a different name and reproduce the problem.contains a spreadsheet with the problem.If you could please review this is may help isolate the problem.ThanksCreatedFile before save as, this file contains the correct line locationsThe file is the file version saved in 3.5 without an extra line.The attachment inseems to be a broken file check filteype with file----------------file Pricing\ 2012\ J6.odsPricing 2012 J6.ods: XML document textcheck integrity with zip :----------------zip -T Pricing\ 2012\ J6.ods zip warning: expected 16 entries but found 13zip error: Zip file structure invalid (Pricing 2012 J6.ods)-> Trying to open this file opens the dialog for textimport.So I can not do any more testing with this file.After saving the attachment inwith a new name and reopend the file I can reproduce the problem.BUT : After deleting the comment in cell D-31 and saving with a new name and reopening the new file there are no extra lines and everything is fine.So it seems the comment causes the problem.I can confirm that deleting the comment solves the problem.Showing it, changing it is not enough.Adding a comment on row 31 (tested on column A,B C,D) seems to be an issue.Adding a comment on row 32 does not cause a problem.How did you discover this as a solution?Thanks for nailing this down.is useful to reproduce and even fix this problem.It is a nasty bug and I hope that we will fix it soon. Well, I am not aware of other similar bugs, so it looks like less typical scenario. The bug was already in older 3.6.x releases => we should not block 3.6.3 with other useful fixes => lowering the severity a bit. I hope that we could fix this for 3.6.4 because it is regression and potential data loss.Whatever it was, it appears to be fixed, tried in 4-1 and 4-2.

I believe this patch should be applied in all released versions of LibreOffice.

Operating System: Ubuntu i take it the CPython GIL is not recursive?that code is obviously broken in that case.that patch you attached is identical to the ApacheOO SVN commitcited in the AOO bug. my understanding is that due to the messylicensing situation we can only apply that on master and the 4.0 branch,but not the 3.6 branch.thanks for pointing out this problem and its solution."i take it the CPython GIL is not recursive?"I suppose so...

id=57956	Problem description: Making drawings or presentation, it is often convenient to be able to adjust (scale) the character width (e.g. to make a word or a sentence look better inside a box, etc. Openoffice and Libreoffice have a function for this under the character formatting menu.Unfortunately, in recent LibO this does not work anymore (in the preview the text is scaled, but in the final display it is not). Steps to reproduce:1. Open LibO draw or presentation2. Create a text box, write something into it3. Select the text4. Select Format -> Character -> Position5. Set a scaling different from 100% for the character width (here you see the preview text getting larger for scales above 100% and tight for scales less than 100%)6. Press OK... and see that nothing actually changes!Current behavior:Text width gets scaled only in the preview, when you press OK to apply the formatting to the text in a text box, the text stays the same regardless of the text width scaling factorExpected behavior:The formatted text should increase or decrease its horizontal scale depending on the scaling factor being selected.Notes:1) This is certainly a regression2) This breaks the formatting of previously prepared documents and particularly of presentations (due to the fact that I am using text scaling in a template, almost all my presentations and lectures are broken and cannot be played properly).3) AOO is OK on this.

But it does NOT migrate any settings from the /LOdev/3/user folder to the /LOdev/4/user/ folder; not even the most general settings, like my user name, or the selected JRE appear in the /LOdev/4/user/ profile. It seems that the new (4) user profile is created from scratch, without attempting to copy any data from the old (3) user profile folder. â Changed Platform to All/All.â Increased Importance: IMHO this is at least a âmajorâ issue, because when LibO 4.0 will be released, most users will expect that all their settings are correctly imported, and we would get bad press if we would not do that.About the question: what to do with the old (3) user profile:(In reply to)This option could be a good idea. But if it is too complicated to implement such an option, please do NOT remove the old user profile folder by default; just leave it there! There always will be some downgraders, and other people -- like me -- switch between LibreOffice versions daily, just depending on the kind of task they need to accomplish.Random notes:* Migration of extension information (stored in berkeleydb files within the user profile) needs to coordinate with potential removal of berkeleydb support from LO, cf. <> "minutes of ESC call ..."* It appears that on case-insensitive file systems (Mac OS X, Windows), existing "3" user profiles got the "MIGRATED" flag file (<> "disable multiple migrations via MIGRATED stamp file") erroneously added when running LO 3 already, cf. <> "User installation migrated onto itself." This needs to be taken into account when trying to migrate from existing "3" user profiles.The idea to ask for user input is that LO/TDF passes responsibility to the user: if the user chooses to delete then s/he can't complain later that it was removed. If s/he chooses to keep it, s/he can't complain that there are left-overs.Hmm, the supported migration paths are configured in registry, see the"Migration" section atI see only the release versions there. It seems that migration from"Dev" builds has never been supported. I guess that Dev builds couldinherit configuration from a release build but not from the older Devbuilds.The best solution would be to produce build-specific registry entry. Iam not sure how to do it easily.Anyway, the migration should work in the official Alpha, Beta, RCbuilds.Bug still exists in versions 4.0.0.1 and 4.0.0.2.Reproduced with Win 7, 32 bit, LO version 3.6.4. Then install version 4.0.0.1.Also reproduced with Win 8, 64 bit and version 4.0.0.2. Importance increased, hence users expect that all their data and settings of the user profile are still available, if they update to version 4.0.x AND all users with changes of their user profile are affected.Hence I expect a lot of user complaints, if this bug is not corrected. Furthermore it will not really raise the image of LibreOffice especially at the start of a new major release (Version 4.x.x). IMHO it's necessary to correct this problem before the release of version 4.0.0.Harald - can you confirm that if you move away your user profiles; and run a released 3.x version - then run the 4.0 version - it does not import those settings ?FWIW - I hate this "not upgrading from -dev versions" thing - it was the underlying cause of tons of mangledness in this code for the last 3.x series releases and we need to stop distinguishing between -dev and non-dev releases wrt. migration I think [ perhaps having a different config directory for each -dev release ;-] But of course that requires some time + thought, and re-working the desktop/ code I guess [ I can't be working on this now sadly ].@Michael:Somehow this all is rather unclear, I wonder what moron made status here NEW ;-)The only fact that counts is whether a 4.0 rc makes the job to update from a 3.x user Profile (and it should do that for any user profile starting from 3.3, and also OOo Profiles should be imported as far as possible (at least some basics like personal data like name ...)All tests I see here are from Master(?!) and to be honest, I currently I do not know whether a LODev Profile is intended to be updated from where ever. I think this definitively is not an ...alpha+ Version's bug.More or less reproducible with "LibO 4.0.0.2 rc - GERMAN UI / German Locale [Build ID: 5991f37846fc3763493029c4958b57282c2597e)]" {tinderbox: @6, pull time 2013-01-24 07:20(?)} on German WIN7 Home Premium (64bit). The effects were obvious, all my Extensions, Macros, own toolbars, security settings and so on were lost.BUT===I did not check whether there might have been an existing /4 user profile from any test before, and so my result does not count. Of course an existing /4 Profile should not be overwrittenI will do an update test under controlled, clean test conditions Some additional thoughts and info:It might be risky all import all Extensions, there might be some not working with 4.0. Eventually they should all be disabled with a comment "please check ..."I did the Brute-force Method for my /4 Profile update and simply copied the /3 Profile to the /4 folder, and everything worked and all 3.6 settings were back after new launch of LibO.My request to Roman, Pedro, ...Can you please retry an update wit non-WIN-OS with definitively not existing /4 Profile from 3.6 to 4.0.0.2RC. All existing other profiles should be hidden to avoid interferences of our test environments (or explicitly state that your update was that way)?Hello Michael,I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly, so don't hesitate to ask me again if necessary. What I did is:(1) LO version 3.6.4 is installed on Win 7 as a standard installation (no parallel installation). User profile in directory /3.(2) Install LO version 4.0.0.1 with Windows Installer. The version 3.6.4 is removed automatically during installation. /3 user profile still exists after installation.(3) Start LO version 4.0.0.1. A new /4 user profile is created. The /3 profile still exists too. Data from the /3 profile have not been moved to the new /4 profile.Michael as I understood it, you asked me to run version 3.x and then to run version 4.0. In the procedure above, it is not possible to do this, hence either only ver. 3.x or 4.0 is installed.What I expect: From"You do not have to de-install any previously-installed version of LibreOffice. If you do have an existing installation of LibreOffice, all your preferences will be preserved and that old installation will simply be overwritten."Also please make sure that the file "MIGRATED" is missing in the directory with "LibreOffice 3" user configuration. It is created there once the configuration is migrated. The file prevents multiple migrations and helps to find what is the last used configuration.(In reply to)Agreed.This just shows that I bothered to do an early test of a Master and report it with 2 MONTHS in advance. This was ignored as "should work".Ideally this should behave as Firefox (check for compatibility/new versions)I tested that as well and it workedI can retry anything you need but on Win (XP and/or 7) only.It works for me. I have just tested it with the 4.0.0.2 build on Windows and the configuration was migrated.Note that I had to remove the file C:\Users\pmladek\AppData\Roaming\LibreOffice\3\MIGRATED and the already existing C:\Users\pmladek\AppData\Roaming\LibreOffice\4 configuration.I guess that the confusion here is caused by the MIGRATION file and Dev builds. Once you run 4.0 Dev build, it migrates the LibreOffice\3 configuration and crates the MIGRATED file in the LibreOffice\3 user config dir. When you install 4.0 release build, it ignores LibreOffice\3 configuration because it has already been migrated. Also it ignores LODev\4 configuration because it is from the Dev build and thus potentially broken.I am not sure what is the idea behind the MIGRATION file but it has been there for ages. I guess that it was introduced to avoid another can of worms when migrating OOo-2.x to OOo-3.x.Note that normal users should not be affected by this bug because they do not install dev builds.(In reply to)See: "It appears that on case-insensitive file systems (Mac OS X, Windows), existing '3' user profiles got the 'MIGRATED' flag file (<> 'disable multiple migrations via MIGRATED stamp file') erroneously added when running LO 3 already, cf. <> 'User installation migrated onto itself.'"See commit linked above.I had assumed that the issue with the MIGRATED file had been addressed (<> "minutes of ESC call ...": "Completed Action Items: need to rename the MIGRATED flag and unwind / test re-migration (Michael): apparently no need to do this - the new directory name takes care of it." But it does not look like the issue is addressed (and I fail to see how the new directory name, LibreOffice\4 on Windows, would take care of anything there).The best solution is probably to either (a) change the name of the flag file from MIGRATED to MIGRATED4 for LO 4 (MIGRATION_STAMP_NAME in MigrationImpl::alreadyMigrated in desktop/soruce/migration/migration.cxx) or (b) get rid of the flag file completely by effectively reverting the commit linked above. Case (a) has the advantage that, when migrating existing user profiles to LO 4 and such a migration leads to a broken LO 4 profile, the user can get out of that by just removing the broken LO 4 profile and starting over. Both cases have the disadvantage that if an old profile already caused migration problems once in the past (but only once, as it was flagged as MIGRATED afterwards), it may cause migration problems now again.I will take care to get solution (a) into libreoffice-4-0-0.@Petr:That's quite nearby what I wanted to test and expected to see in my laboratory, so I think there is no need for my announced test?@Stephan:Thank you for assigning to you!Tested on Mac OX 10.6 and recent LO 4.0.0.2: No migration, brand new /LibreOffice/4/ - folder.No "MIGRATION" file found in /LibreOffice/3/user/(In reply to)The file in question would rather be .../LibreOffice/3/MIGRATED (note both directory and file name are different from what you state).Started from zero on a Win7 x64 machine (deleted LibreOffice personal data folder)*Nothing* was imported from 3.6.4.3 to 4.0.0.2File .../LibreOffice/3/MIGRATED is present but it is NOT related to LOdev (this machine NEVER had Dev build installed)Stephan Bergmann committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#57061: Use a new MIGRATION4 flag file for profile migration LO 3 -> 4The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

There is an improvement to version 4.0.0.2, but as I checked it is not completely solved.My System: Win 7 Prof., German, 32bitThis is what I did:Step [A]: Preparations in order to get a clean system:(1) All LibreOffice versions and help packs deinstalled.(2) Folders "C:\Program Files\LibreOffice 3.6" and "C:\Program Files\LibreOffice 4.0" don't exist.Some folders with LibreOffice administrative installations still exist in C:\Program Files. They are named "LibreOffice 3.x.x Parallel".(3) No existing user profiles, that means I renamed them to "...AppData\Roaming\XXX-LibreOffice"Step [B]: Installation of version 3.6.4:(1) Main installer, typical installation(2) Installation of German built-in help.All 2 packages are installed in "C:\Program Files\LibreOffice 3.6". Step [C]: Create and modify user profile with version 3.6.4:(1) Start LO 3.6.4. A user profile "...\AppData\Roaming\LibreOffice\3" is created. In folder "...\3" a file called "MIGRATED" has been created too !!!(2) Modify user profile, I did this: (a) Open an existing text file and close file. (Recent document) (b) Resize LibreOffice window (c) Change an option. I unchecked the option "Tips" (d) Open new text document and create an autotext and use it.(3) Close and start LO again. All changes of the user profile are still in effect. Close LO again.Step [D]: Installation of version 4.0.0.3:(1) Main installer, typical installation(2) Installation of German built-in help.All 2 packages are installed in "C:\Program Files\LibreOffice 4.0". Version 3.6.4 is replaced completely. The folder "C:\Program Files\LibreOffice 3.6" still exists, but it is empty.Step [E]: Start version 4.0.0.3 and check the user profile:(1) Start LO. A user profile "...\AppData\Roaming\LibreOffice\4" is created. The profile "../3" still exists. In folder ".../3 the file "MIGRATED" still exists. Additionally a new file called "MIGRATED4" has been created !!!(2) (a) Recent Document: not migrated !!! (b) Window size: not migrated !!! (c) Tips unchecked, migrated. (d) Autotext: migrated.(3) Close LO.(4) Rename profile "..\4" to "..\X4", rename "..\3" to "..\4".(5) Start LO 4.0.0.3. Now all 4 changes of the user profile are in effect.If you do the same procedure with 4.0.0.2 the result is different:(1) Start LO. A user profile "...\AppData\Roaming\LibreOffice\4" is created. The profile "../3" still exists. In folder ".../3 the file "MIGRATED" still exists. A file called "MIGRATED4" is not created. (2) (a) Recent document: not migrated !!! (b) Window size: not migrated !!! (c) Tips unchecked not migrated !!! (d) Autotext not migrated !!!(3) Close LO.(4) Rename "..\4" to "..\X4", rename "..\3" to "..\4".(5) Start LO 4.0.0.3. Now all 4 changes of the user profile are in effect.Conclusion: It seemed to me that parts of the user profile are migrated now (4.0.0.3), but not all. Hence bug reopened (with hesitation...)Excellent testing!(In reply to)I believe this proves that Migration CAN and SHOULD be improved.I opened a topic inbut no one seems to be worried or (HOPEFULLY) they are using their time to fix the problem instead of writing :)Thank you for reopening the BUG ;)I now also checked the migration of changes of the user interface (customizing). These changes are also not migrated. The general procedure is the same like in. First open a new text document. Then I did these changes in version 3.6.5:(a) Display of additional tool bar: View > Toolbars > Drawing(b) Display of additional icon in toolbar: context menu on toolbar Standard > Visible Buttons > New Document From Template(c) Change order of a menu: Tools > Customize... > Menus > LibreOffice Writer Menus: I just moved the item "New" below "Open..."After installing 4.0.0.3 the changes of the user profile made with 3.6.5 are lost !!!I do not know, if my problems according migrating the user profile are general problems. If this is the case I am not sure if it is a good idea to release RC3 hence I expect user complaints.Some general thoughts according migration from version 3.6.x to 4.0.x:(1) Is it not the easiest way just to copy (or rename?) the /3 user profile to a new /4 profile, if LO does not find a /4 profile at start? When I did this manually it always works for me. (2) The files "MIGRATED" or "MIGRATED4" are just confusing. As I understood they are necessary for development. Is it not better to banish them from a release version and find another solution for development?(3) Is it really necessary to use different folders for the user profile (".../3", ".../4", ...) when changing the first digit of the LO version? Is there possibly a compatibility problem? If not the "/3" or "/4" folder could be removed from the path.By the way: Does someone know if there is a forward compatibility of LO 3.6.x to /4 user profiles if they are renamed to /3? This may be interesting for users who like to go back from version 4.0.x to 3.6.x or for exchange of profiles between different systems or users.In reply toand:In general, what parts of an old user profile are migrated is controlled by configuration settings in the /org.openoffice.Setup/Migration tree (see officecfg/registry/data/org/openoffice/Setup.xcu). The data that is present there is apparently mostly what had been there for the migration from OOo 2 to OOo 3 already. The reason why certain parts of a user profile had been excluded from migration back than are probably lost to history.Note that this user profile migration code already kicked in on Linux during the LO 3 timeframe, when <> "fdo#32263" moved the location of the user profile from ~/.libreoffice/3 to ~/.config/libreoffice/3 and <> "default config location has changed, look in old config dir when migrating" enabled LO's migration code to migrate from an existing ~/.libreoffice/3 to a new ~/.config/libreoffice/3.Therefore, at least my assumption would have been that that migration worked acceptably, or else (Linux) users would already have complained when upgrading from old LO 3 versions (that used ~/.libreoffice/3) to newer LO 3 versions (that used ~/.config/libreoffice/3) about settings getting lost. However, re-checking that now, things like the list of recently used documents indeed were not migrated back then, either. Apparently nobody looked at the migration machinery in detail, whether it works acceptably for migrating individual settings to a new LO 4 user profile.Addressing specific items from the above comments:* List of recently used documents: This apparently manifests itself in configuration items (in the user profile's user/registrymodifications.xcu) in the /org.openoffice.Office.Histories tree, which is not included in the migrated data. Whether there ever was or still is any good (technical) reason for that I do not know offhand.* Window sizes: These apparently manifest themselves in configuration items (in the user profile's user/registrymodifications.xcu) in the /org.openofice.Office.Views tree, which is not included in the migrated data. Again, wheter there ever was or still is any good (technical) reason for that I do not know offhand, but the odd format in which this data is saved makes it not unlikely that this was considered too fragile for migration at least in the past.* Autotexts: These apparently manifest themselves as files in the user/autotext/ directory, which explicitly are migrated (cf. ".*/autotext/.*" listed in /org.openoffice.Setup/Migration/SupportedVersions['OpenOffice.org3+OpenOffice.org2+StarOffice8+StarSuite8+Libreoffice3']/MigrationSteps['Common']/IncludedFiles in officecfg/registry/data/org/openoffice/Setup.xcu), and indeed an existing ~/.config/libreoffice/3/user/autotext/mytexts.bau is copied to ~/.config/libreoffice/4/user/autotext/mytexts.bau and works fine in LO 4 at least when I try that out with my local master build on Linux. So this needs further verification.* View - Toolbars - Drawing: This apparently manifests itself in configuration items (in the user profile's user/registrymodifications.xcu) in the /org.openoffice.Office.UI.WriterWindowState tree, which is not included in the migrated data. Again, wheter there ever was or still is any good (technical) reason for that I do not know offhand, but, again, the format in which this data is saved makes it not unlikely that this was considered too fragile for migration at least in the past.* context menu on toolbar Standard > Visible Buttons > New Document From Template: This apparently manifests itself in the file user/config/soffice.cfg/modules/swriter/toolbar/standardbar.xml. The migration data mentioned above lists ".*/config/soffice.cfg/modules/.*/toolbar/custom.*\.xml", but that apparently does not match this file, so it is not copied. What's the story there I do not know.* Tools > Customize... > Menus: This apparently manifests itself in the file user/config/soffice.cfg/modules/swriter/menubar/menubar.xml, which is not included in the migrated data. Again, what's the story there I do not know.* "Is it not the easiest way just to copy (or rename?) the /3 user profile to a new /4 profile, if LO does not find a /4 profile at start?" While most of the old data could indeed be reused, a new major release is generally considered a good point in time for incompatible changes in user profile data, thus demanding more sophisticated migration than wholesale copy/rename. There is at least some changes (like changing bundled extensions into core parts, and changing the database format for information about installed extensions) that benefited from this for LO 4.* "The files 'MIGRATED' or 'MIGRATED4' are just confusing. As I understood they are necessary for development." No, see <> "disable multiple migrations via MIGRATED stamp file" for the reason the MIGRATED file got introduced. Having said that, I personally think that design is flawed, and we best get rid of those flag files again; I have that on my to-do list.* "Does someone know if there is a forward compatibility of LO 3.6.x to /4 user profiles if they are renamed to /3?" There is no guarantee for that to work. If it works, it works by chance, not by design.(In reply to)Also verified that it works fine on Windows when migrating from <> to <>.Argh, this is in line with "Autotext: migrated." from, so forget about this. I had apparently misread that as if it claimed "not working."(In reply to)The user folder should be copied...IMHO a very good idea ;)From a non-LibO developers point: Is there a possibility to check weather there were any major changes?Finally I did some changes:- Changed priority to highest (IMHO release of 4.0 _should_ be postponed because of this bug. If we expect, that something isn't working it should even not be called Beta, it should be called Alpha or even Daily! [I am very sorry for how this statement sounds like, it's a little bit too direct ;)]- I changed the URL. Oiginal URL:I am sorry but this can't be taken as a blocker. Yes, it is annoying that some setting is lost. Though, it does not affect the functionality of the software. It is still well usable.Is it really a blocker when user lost the list of recently used documents or few 3rd-party extensions that even might need an update to work with the new release? Are these the most critical problems in this release?All linux users lost similar level of setting with the switch from LO-3.4 to LO-3.5 and I am not aware of any strong complains.BTW: I am very surprised by the sentence:--- cut --- "If we expect, that something isn't working it should even not be called Beta, it should be called Alpha or even Daily!--- cut ---I am sorry but this is non-realistic. It would mean that we would not be able to release next few years until we fix all bugs and regressions caused by all fixes. Note that it would include implementing all missing features for 100% import/export from/into the supported file formats to avoid any potential "data loss". Unfortunately, the software would be very outdated in compare with the competitors at this point.Please, read also. The time based release means that .0 release is intended for enthusiasts. It might include include even annoying bugs.I am sorry if the above sounded too strong. It was just a reaction on the previous quite strong comment. I wanted to emphasize that the situation is not that easy and we have to see it from different point of views :-)(In reply to)If you describe it like that noTrueYou are very right at this point. But the problem is: We can't fix that later on ( or only for 5.0 which definitely is not in the very near future...)+1Year I totally understand your point, but here my reason for this sharp sentence above (I didn't get it sound more friendly - sorry for that)Of course. And the most important aspect: You have more experience on how to release a program :-)But please read my rephrased argument ( it isn't sharp any more AND you were not too strong):If we didn't do it in 4.0 we have to do it with 5.0 [2016-2018 IMHO] --> We should do this ASAP with (if that is possible) 5.0 testing builds...(In reply to)No. Those were examples. I think we have no idea of the extent of loss.But here are some more problemsThen it's ok because people don't complain?That is a Developer perspective. From a USER and PUBLIC perception it is a MAJOR update. So having a BAD .0 release is simply BAD marketing.If renaming the \3 to \4 folder solves many problems, maybe comparing what is the difference between the renamed \4 and the imported \4 could bring major improvements?I tried LO4 RC3 and discovered all my personal settings gone.....now I am here, and I am discovering there is a debate going on the relevance of this.I do not pretend to be right on this issue, but one fact is clear: after realizing this, I downgraded back to 3.6.5 - no doubt about it. I have dozens and dozens of toolbar personalizations, to say the least.I do hope this can be fixed, at least indicating a "manual" way to recover your profile after the install of 4.0I tried simply to replace the contents of the user/libreoffice/4/user with those of the user/libreoffice/3/user, but it did not work. Is there another more successful way?ThanksHi there. Andy - continuing to use 3.6.x is fine of course - we should have this fixed for 4.0.1 in a few weeks more - along with plenty of other issues. It'd be great to have more testing (and MAB prioritisation) further in advance of 4.1 I guess - though Pedro did a great job to file this in September and we sucked at prioritising / identifying it as an issue it seems. Florian - you're quite right - the apparently endless problems of migration are really irritating ... we need to come up with some creative regression tests for it I think to avoid issues in future.I tested my theory and it works perfectly. Even extensions are migrated. At least under Windows :)If the user does a Custom install of 3.x to %ProgramFiles%\LibreOffice\ (no version in the name) then when updating to 4.0 just install to the same folder. Then before running for the first time just make a copy of the whole \3 folder (in Windows located at %AppData%\LibreOffice\) and rename it to 4.This is what Windows users expect to happen ;)Maybe TDF can humor Windows users (even if they are a minority of LO users) by making the installer work the way they expect it to work? I believe this would be a good starting point to attract more Windows users...>Heh ;-) the whole idea of the migration code is to end up with a clean, and well understood state that does not have tons of legacy twists, turns, variants and potential problems in it.Having said that - it's clear that we also intend to migrate far more than we do - work needed; help appreciated etc.Hi Pedro, I am trying to grasp your workaround correctly, forgive for my inability to precisely understand each step from you previous post.you write:If the user does a Custom install of 3.x to %ProgramFiles%\LibreOffice\ (no version in the name) then when updating to 4.0 just install to the same folder.What does this mean? Of course I have my present LO3.6.5 install in a "\libreoffice3.6" folder in "\programfiles". Should I uninstall this from "\libreoffice 3.6" and reinstall the same release in a "\libreoffice" only folder? And my settings will be fully migrated, right?After this step 1, step 2 is installing 4.003 in the same "\libreoffice" only folder, i.e. overwriting the 3.6.5 install of the step before, correct?then you write: Then before running for the first time just make a copy of the whole \3 folder (in Windows located at %AppData%\LibreOffice\) and rename it to 4.At this point, step 3 involves that before running the 4.003 upgrade, i move to the "appdata\libreoffice" folder and clone the "\3" into a "\4" one.After this I should be able to run the 4.003 release with all my beloved personal settings at their place, right?If you confirm (or adjust where I am wrong), tomorrow I try give it a try and let you know. Thanks for now!Hence there is the risk that users lose parts of their user profile, IMHO users should be at least informed that (1) there may be problems with the migration of the user profile from Version 3.6.x to 4.0.0, (2) it is recommended to backup the user profile of the 3.6.x version, in order to be able to recover the user profile or parts of it in case of a data loss.To my opinion the release notes website page would be a reasonable place for this information.Additional info: At the German discuss mailing list a user reported that his AutoCorrect and AutoText data are lost in both (/3 and /4) profiles while installing 4.0.0.3. Hence he made a backup of his profile he could recover his data. In the moment I believe that this not a general problem. I asked the user to reproduce this behaviour.It is mentioned atI have just modified many settings in "Tools/Options/LibreOffice Calc" with 3.6. It seems that everything is migrated to 4.0 => it looks promissing with the "Tools/Options" setting.I also tried to do some changes in toolbard and they were not migrated => we should fix this.I wonder if we could check all this somehow more systematically.The toolbars setting is stored under 3/user/config/soffice.cfg/modules while most of the other setting is stored in 3/user/registrymodifications.xcuPetr Mladek committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":migrate menu and toolbars customization (fdo#57061)The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.Petr Mladek committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-4-0":migrate menu and toolbars customization (fdo#57061)It will be available in LibreOffice 4.0.1.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.(In reply to)I strongly agree with Pedro. This should have been a blocker. The release criteria page on the TDF wiki () specifically calls out data loss as a valid symptom of a blocker bug, and this bug meets the other conditions. It is these kinds of bugs that lead many IT managers in the US to steer away from FOSS and that freak out typical users who are using a previous version. I expect that many non-programmer users who update, and then discover that settings are lost will feel alienated, and will drop LO Writer for another word processing program. I am very concerned that bad migration stories will prove to be a marketing disaster, especially with TDF's major PR for 4.0.In:This absolutely affects the functionality of the software. Users can no longer do what they were doing before without massive time commitment to reset everything manually. It is very important to remember the differing perspectives between developers and users. Otherwise eventually it will only be the developers using the software.more from:I agree that the recently used documents list is not high priority: it is transient data that just adds a little efficiency to using the software. However, the extension list is definitely high priority for many users. I would bet you that even most users who heavily use extensions don't even know which ones they have installed. They will attempt to do things in LO 4.0 that worked in their 3.X installation, but won't work now. They may have no idea that this is because of an extension! They may spend significant trouble-shooting the problem to no avail, and just leave LO. Some users have spent many hours customizing their AutoText or AutoCorrect entries, keyboard shortcuts, toolbars and menus. Not migrating those should definitely have been a blocker in my opinion, or at least there should have been clear, easy-to-find information about the bug, with a big warning on the download page.Again, a lack of understanding of the typical user. 99% (at least) of users will never post anything to Bugzilla or LO mailing lists or anywhere else. If they get majorly frustrated with the software, they will just go use a different word processor.This is also a misunderstanding of the typical user. How would the typical user even find this page? On www.libreoffice.org, no page has a link to the release plan summary. Only 2 pages have a link to the release plan. One is is the pre-releases page, where it is labeled "release schedule", a page unlikely to be read by a typical user.The other is the release policy page, where again the release plan is referred to "release schedule". Typical users are not likely to think there would be something important to them in a "release policy". Even if they do read that page, it says the reasons for 2 maintained branches are large deployments and Linux distribution, not bugs. It goes on to say "as a general rule, The Document Foundation advises all users to upgrade to the new version as soon as possible." And "It is not correct to assume that versions from previous branches are 'safer' or 'more stable'." This would seem to indicate that TDF wants single users to upgrade ASAP, with no mention of the migration or any other bugs.And even if by some miracle a user gets to the release plan page, s/he is not likely to think there would be something important to them in a "release plan".Now the LO home page redirects to a huge, splashy announcement of 4.0, which certainly seems aimed at the general user. No mention of annoying bugs, no mention of the release plan philosophy. The page that the download button takes you to also says nothing about annoying bugs or the release plan, nor even any indication that the user should consider downloading an earlier version. There is a link to what is labeled as the release notes page. (Which is not a real release notes page, since it doesn't even describe what is new in the release.)This "release notes" page says that 4.0.0: "contains many exciting new features, and is suitable for early adopters and private power users",and that 3.6.5: "contains many exciting new features, and is the recommended version for home and corporate users."The first 7 words are the same. Those two sentences make it sound like there may be extra fancy, specialized features in 4.0.0, not that it might be buggy. The very bottom sentence of the 4.0.0 release notes finally mentions bugs, and links to the real release notes page on the TDF wiki for "a few annoying bugs". I believe the typical user of a previous version would consider major settings loss far more than annoying. Finally, on that page, is a link to this bug. This bug is long and technical, with a vague title, and no succinct description of the problem.So .... A user gets excited by the flashy announcement on the home page, and attempts to download 4.0. On their second clicked-through page, s/he may see the line about some bugs. S/he might follow that link to the third clicked-through page, which mentions that some settings are not migrated. It isn't until s/he reaches the fourth clicked-through page where there is even a chance of the user understanding what settings are not migrated.I am not writing all this to attack Petr or any other developer. I am a strong FOSS supporter, and am thrilled to use LO. I am very, very grateful for all the time and energy you all donate to the project! I am just concerned that not keeping in mind the perspectives of typical users will eventually doom the project. It has happened before on other projects.I realize that much of this post touches on larger issues than just this bug. If there is another appropriate place to post this, let me know.I am not a programmer, but am happy to help out in other ways.It is hard to say who is right. I have heard quite positive feed back about 4.0 so far. I am sure that some people will get annoyed and I am not happy about that but it was not easy to decide.BTW: I am going through the setting and working on patch to improve the migration. The situation in 4.0.0 was not that bad. Majority of the Tools/Options setting was migrated. The list of recent documents and toolbars personalization seem to be the biggest missing part.Just did an 4.0.0.3 installation over an 3.6.4.3 one via msi deployment on a Windows 7 Prof. x64 workstation.The personal data is well migrated, but seems the user modified paths from Options - LibreOffice - Paths are not migrated. At least the modified template and autotext paths do not show up in the configuration dialog.Another report about this happening. I updated from LO 3.5.? to 4.0.0.3 on a Windows 7 machine and lost all of my custom dictionaries, extensions (well, I only had one), key mappings and other preferences. The App Data/Roaming/Libre Office/3/ folder contains to files, MIGRATED (date implies it's from a previous update) and MIGRATED4, as well as the folder user. Is there any way I can manually get this data into LO4? And will a bugfix actually help in cases like mine where the damage already has been done?Petr Mladek committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":migrate even more user setting (fdo#57061)The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.Hi Paul, I'm sorry you got bitten by this issue; however - we have a time based release schedule, and this was not a sufficiently critical issue to hold the release (nor was there a fix in sight for it as/when we went live).TDF repeatedly, and emphatically states that "IT managers" should be paying for a professionally supported product version. These versions tend not to be based from a .0 release, better they come with real L3 support that can fix bugs and issues, and without which any migration is likely to fail. So - if your claim is that vanilla LibreOffice at a point-zero release is not adequate for an IT manager - you are quite correct.We can of course improve the wording of our announcements always; in the Free Software world, it's well understood that a point-zero release is always less polished than a point-<N> one :-) we can articulate that better of course.However - driving too many people away may defeat the point: without testers the software will not improve. On that topic, it would be great to have more people running master builds and reporting problems against them to help find problems (such as this) much earlier.Anyhow - thanks for your input ! noted.Petr Mladek committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":migrate also custom accelerators setting (fdo#57061)The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.I went though the officecfg/registry/data/org/openoffice/Office files from LO-3.6 sources and enabled migration of few more items: + paths setting + recently opened files + recovery setting (enable/disable; time) + ODF import/export setting + font anti aliasing setting + windows and toolbars setting (visibility, position, docking) + custom acceleratorsIt seems to work fine and looks safe. People have already complained about many of these items.I was not brave enough to enable few other items, for example:Ah, I hate the TAB+ENTER combination in bugzilla because it submit the message when I do not wan't. Anyway, let's continue.I was not brave enough to enable some other items, for example: + Office/Canvas + Office/ProtocolHandler + Office/Stripting + Office/SFX + Office/UI/CalcCommands + Office/UI/WriterCommands + I was not sure what they mean and how to modify them + They looked a bit strange + I wonder if they can be modified by the UI at all + Office/FormWizard + Office/WebWizard + Office/Common/Help/Registration + Office/DataAccess/Bibliography + Office/DataAccess/DataSources + the Writer wizard and the other stuff was explicitly disabled in the past, I guess that there was a reason for thisThe three last commits should solve most of the mentioned problems.If I did not miss anything, the only remaining problem are the extensions. AFAIK, Stephan mentioned somewhere that the user-specific extensions are migrated. So, the problem is only with system wide extensions but it can't be solved easily. Anyway, the same problem was with any update, for example between 3.4 and 3.5 or between 3.5 and 3.6 => this was always problem => it should not be part of this bug.=> I would consider it as FIXED. Feel free to reopen it if I missed something.If you have already migrated your configuration with LO-4.0.0.3 or earlier, you still have chance to migrate also the missing stuff.One possibility is to migrate it once again. The problem is that you lose the changes that you already did in LO-4.0. Anyway, the steps are: 1. stop LO 2. remove libreoffice/4 user configuration 3. remove libreoffice/3/MIGRATED4 file 4. start LO 4 againAnother possibility is to copy only the missing parts: 1. copy libreoffice/3/config/soffice.cfg/modules/* into libreoffice/4/config/soffice.cfg/modules to migrate changes inside toolbars and menus (new items, visible items, different order) 2. copy the interesting parts from libreoffice/3/registrymodifications.xcu to libreoffice/4/registrymodifications.xcu The file seems to be well formatted and alphabetically sorted. The content is relatively easy to understand. You need to copy whole lines and better whole sections with similar prefix. For example, lines starting with <item oor:path="/org.openoffice.Office.UI.WriterGlobalWindowState/UIElements define positions of extra elements in Writer, especially toolbars. Or lines starting with <item oor:path="/org.openoffice.Office.Histories/Histories describe the recently opened files.(In reply to)@kliems, which extensions was that, and was it installed per-user or shared?***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***(In reply to)It was the Zotero plugin (). I can't really remember in which way is was installed -- presumably I installed as suggested on the linked page.From a practical perspective I'm more concerned with my dictionaries and auto-complete entries, as reinstalling extensions is no big deal.(In reply to)Ah, that Zotero extension ("tunneled in" via a Zotero-LibreOffice-Plugin-3.5.4.xpi Firefox extension) might indeed be special. Likely that it results in the LO extension being installed shared; and shared extensions are not migrated, see.Petr Mladek committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-4-0":migrate even more user setting (fdo#57061)It will be available in LibreOffice 4.0.1.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

It fixes migration of: * LO Window size * âEnable macro recordingâ and âEnable experimental featuresâ and few more options * Paths > My documents * Macros (macro created with macro recorder, macro inserts just some words) The following two items worked for me with 4.0.1.1 build on Linux, so there was nothing to do: * Tools/Options/LibreOffice/Appearance/Document background * Customize keyboard (assigned âStyle > Paragraph > Heading 6â to CTRL+6 it Tools/Customization/Keyboard)harald-koester@:I am not sure why the two last things did not work for you. Could you please try it once again with the 4.0.1.1 build.BTW: harald-koester@ what system are you testing on, please? Linux or Windows or ...?Hi Petr,(In reply to)OK, I'll try it again on Saturday or Sunday.My System: Win 7 Prof.harald-koester@, I have two more ideas what might went wrong.1. Note that the migration works only in two ways: + LibreOffice -> LibreOffice (between official builds) + LibreOffice -> LODev (from official 3.x build to daily 4.x build) , so you need to do the original changes using the official LibreOffice-3.x build. I guess that you know this but just for sure :-) 2. There is one known limitation. The Tools/Options/LibreOffice/Appearance setting is not correctly migrated from LibreOffice -> LODev build. There is used the "LibreOffice" vs. "LODev" identification => this can't be tested only with official RC builds. If you used LODev daily build of 4.X, it explains why the Appearance > Document background setting was not migrated in your case.3. The shortcuts are localization-specific. You do not see your changes if you use different localization for 3.X and 4.X builds. I guess that you use your native language localization for 3.x and the English localization for the 4.X daily build => this might explain the non-migrated keyboard customization.Could you please confirm that you used a daily LODev build with another localization for testing?Here are new test results:User profile created with version 3.6.5 release, UI: GermanMigration tested with version 4.0.1.1, UI: GermanMigrated items:* Recent documents (OK)* LO Window size (NOT MIGRATED)* Some randomly tested options: - LibreOffice > User data (OK) - LibreOffice > General > Tips (OK) - LibreOffice > Memory > Undo > Steps (OK) - LibreOffice > Advanced > âEnable macro recordingâ and âEnable experimental featuresâ (NOT MIGRATED), different options cathegory in Version 3.6.x: LibreOffice > General - LibreOffice > Paths > My documents (NOT MIGRATED) - LibreOffice > Appearance > Document background (OK) - Load/Save > General > Save > Edit document properties...

Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.Harald, thanks a lot for retesting. The following items should get fixed by the last commit: * LO Window size * Some randomly tested options: - LibreOffice > Advanced > âEnable macro recordingâ and âEnable experimental featuresâ - LibreOffice > Paths > My documents * Macros (macro created with macro recorder, macro inserts just some words)I am waiting for one more approval, so I am pretty sure that it will be in 4.0.1.2 build.-------The only remaining this is: * Change order in Menu (NOT MIGRATED !!!) Was OK with Version 4.0.1.0+ (2013-02-19 08.45.16) !!!I did the following test in Writer: * Add "Bibliography Database" into "File" menu, just after "Close" (OK) * Move "Safe" before "Close" in the "File" menu (NOT MIGRATED) * Move "Zoom" on top of the "View" menu (OK)So, the menu migration partly works. LO-4.0 has the new menu entry "File/Safe As Template". I guess that LO-4.0 somehow enforced the updated "Save *" section and blocked moving the "Save" menu entry. I think that it is a corner case and not-worth fixing.Harald, what changes you did in the menus, please?Do you see the problem with more menu entries?Petr Mladek committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-4-0-1":migrate even more configuration setting (fdo#57061)It will be available already in LibreOffice 4.0.1.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.(In reply to)I did this 2 tests:(1) In the Writer menu "File" I moved the item "New" below "Open...". This was not migrated.(2) In the same menu I added the Command "Application > Extended Tips" at the end of the menu. This works. (But I just observed another problem: I tested the migration with the German UI. In order to tell you the right English names for the different items I changed to the English UI. But the language of the new inserted menu entry still is in German !! Just for your information. I think this is not a migration problem.) Hence I only performed the mentioned two test cases, I can't estimate if there are more problems with the migration of the menus. From my point of view there are some more test cases necessary in order to get a good 'feeling': change menu items not only in Writer, delete items from the menu, rename menu items, add a new menu group, add submenus, ....I intend to do some more tests according the migration of the menu, but you know, it's not a 5-minute-task ....I made some more tests according migration of menu changes.User profile created with version 3.6.5 release, UI: GermanMigration tested with version 4.0.1.1, UI: GermanHere are the results:(1) Change order: Writer menu: File: âNewâ moved on position down (below âOpen...â) (NOT MIGRATED)Worked with Version 4.0.1.0+ (2013-02-19 08.45.16)(2) Change order: Writer menu: Table > âSplit cells...â: moved 3 postions lower (below âSplit table...â) (NOT MIGRATED)(3) Add Item: Writer menu: âFileâ, âExtended tipsâ added to last position (OK)(4) Delete item: Writer menu: Format > âStyles and Formattingâ deleted (NOT MIGRATED)(5) Rename item: Writer menu: View, name of âRulerâ changed (NOT MIGRATED)(6) Change order in submenu: Writer menu: Format > Anchor > âTo pageâ moved to the end of submenu (NOT MIGRATED)(7) Add item in submenu: Writer menu: Item added to submenu âInsertâ > âObjectâ (OK) (8) Delete item in submenu: Writer menu: Edit > Changes > item âComment...â deleted (NOT MIGRATED)(9) Rename item in submenu: Writer menu: Tools > Update > âPage Formattingâ renamed (OK)(10) Rename default menu group.

(SUBMENU WRONGLY ADDED)Update: just installed 4.0.1.2Many progresses in user data migration.However some settings are still not migrated:1) Java version is not selected (was manually selected in 3.6.5.2)2) Online update checking was manually unselected in 3.6.5.2 and is selected again in 4.0.1.2Because pathnames where changed, all Shared extensions were lost and need to be reinstalled. More on this in the QA mailing list.I too, tried 4.0.1.2:I uninstalled 3.6.5 from the "Libreoffice 3.6" folder;I the installed 4.0.1.2 in the default "libreoffice 4.0" folder.Unfortunately, no personal setting was migrated, starting from personalized toolbars, which are gone and replaced by the standard ones.Am I missing something?Shouldn't the 4.0.1 solve this?Maybe I have to install it in the same "libreoffice 3.6" folder of the previous version?Or I should not uninstall 3.6.5 before installing 4.0.1?Any hint is really welcome, thanks(In reply to)Please, read the. You need to remove the "libreoffice/4" configuration and also the "libreoffice/3/MIGRATED4" file to trigger the migration.I see. I have now solved my own case by applying Pedro's advice (basically, first moving the 3.6 install in a generic "libreoffice" folder, and then installing 4.0.1.2 on top of it, plus some other details).However, I thought that the 4.0.1 sub-release was aiming at giving user an effortless migration experience from 3.x.... if you still have to fiddle with hidden files and folders in "appdata/libreoffice", I would say the process is not ready for prime time yet.(In reply to)That was not the only goal of 4.0.1Fixes in the 4.0.x branch will continue until version 4.1.0 is released.So keep posting problems on this bug report.For further discussion go to(In reply to)The fixes will help people who newer started 4.0.0 but they start testing the 4.0 release with 4.0.1 build. The fiddling with the hidden files and folders is needed only for people who already migrated with 4.0.0 release and they want to do it once again with the improved 4.0.1.By other words, we could not fix already migrated configuration automatically. It would remove changes that people made with 4.0.0.I have finally got time to look at the migration problems again and I am able to fix only one thing easily. The rest is more complicated :-(1. Java setting is not migrated (by Pedro) + one reason is that we do not copy user/config/javasettings*.xml + but even if we copy the file, it does not help because there is modified the list of supported vendors in /opt/libreoffice4.0/ure/share/misc/javavendors.xml; This change would cause re-detection and reset to the default java even if we do not move the migration. We could do better but this is an old bug. It would happen even if we did 3.7 instead of 4.0. I would suggest to solve it separately.2. Online update checking was manually unselected in 3.6.5.2 and is selected again in 4.0.1.2 (by Pedro) + This can be fixed by enabling the migration for "/org.openoffice.Office.Jobs" in officecfg/registry/data/org/openoffice.Grr, i have this "TAB" + "Enter" behavior in bugzilla. Let me continue: + I am going to put the fix for the online checking after some investigation3. Many changes in menu entries are not migrated (by Harald) + it seems that the menu entries are filtered by a pretty old code added by+ IMHO, the problem is that the code does not know if the menu entries were added/removed/renamed by the user or by the new version. It has to guess and it seems to be using the following approach: a) it ignores renamed entries because they might be renamed by the new version; It helps to be compatible with help and tutorials; By other words, it always enforces the name from the new version; This explains the non-renamed menu items - problem 5, 13, 16 from. d) It ignore moved entries because the move could be caused by new version. It again helps to be compatible with help and tutorials. The only exception are menu entries added by the user, see below. By other words, it resets the order according to the new menu. It keeps the entries that are not longer in the new menu on the location where they were before. This explains the non-migrated moves - problems 1, 2, 6, 12, 14 b) It tries to do not lose any user added entry. It keep all entries from the old user menu that are not in the new menu. This explains the forgotten menu entry - problem 18 from. c) It tries to do not loose any new menu entry from the new application. It keep all entries from the new menu that are not in the old user menu. This explains the non-deleted entries - problems 4, 8, 16, 17 from. Note that the two zoom items are caused by non-deleted old "Zoom" entry. So, it is explained. The questions is what to do with it. I do not see any easy solution. The current logic sounds reasonable. If we want to solve it properly, we would need to store information about all menu changes between all old OOo and LO release and use it in the update logic. This would be a real hard hack and I am not sure if it is worth the effort. It would be actually needed even for update between minor versions that modify menu entries as well. If we want to better solve the menu migration, I would open separate enhancement bug for it.Petr Mladek committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":Migrate also Java and Online Update setting (fdo#57061)The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.(In reply to)Well done Petr ;)Since these are all bug fixes (and not new features) can't they be cherry picked to the 4.0.x branch so that they can be tested and added to 4.0.2?Petr Mladek committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-4-0":Migrate also Java and Online Update setting (fdo#57061)It will be available in LibreOffice 4.0.2.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.82 comments later can we close this as FIXED and give Petr a big thank you? ;)I have opened separate bugs to track the two remaining problems: +for enhancing java migration +for enhancing custom menus and toolbars migrationAll other mentioned problems should be fixed in 4.0.2.1 build. Please, note that you need to manually trigger the migration if you want to try it again, see thefor more details.Let's close this long bug and keep fingers crossed :-)Well done, Petr :)Just updated to 4.0.2.1All settings that I modified were imported, even the Updates check.Kudos!(In reply to)You bet. I'm very surprised that this happened at all. I had deliberately skipped 4.0, in anticipation that such gross errors would be eliminated in the next release (4.0.1.2), which I installed. Dead wrong.Fortunately, I know how to manually move the user files. Those who don't and have much customization done could be screaming mad. (On the safe side, I had even backed up the whole folder just before installing.)Good this this is fixed for the next release. Still, I think it's very important to trace how this could have happened, and implement some kind of protocol to prevent it.Kumara - we have such a protocol; it is called pre-release builds. I'm glad you agree that this is important, so you can get involved in testing those quite easily - please do so. Master builds -should- be usable for daily work, and in some cases have more bug fixes than the release builds.Failing that - you could contribute some unit tests for migration - currently there are zero of them; it would be fantastic to have some :-) Failing that, if you can't program, then getting involved with manual testing & bug triage is greatly appreciated.Thanks !Michael, I'm aware of testing the pre-release builds. I don't recall having done it before, and am very grateful to people who have. I should consider doing it, but admit that I'm unable to at this time.At any rate, this isn't exactly the protocol I wasn't speaking about. Perhaps "protocol" is not the right word to use. I'm interested in solving a bigger "bug": the *reason* such a bug happened despite the existing testing protocol. (There are other surprising bugs on LO4.) Could it be that the alloted time frame for testing is not long enough? Could it be that the range of testers isn't wide enough? ("Range" as in the variety of people who uses LO in different ways.) We need to ask such questions.I apologise if I'm using a wrong platform for this. Let me know if there's a better place to discuss this. Come to think of it, this kind of work is more suitable for me than testing, as I'm unwilling to risk losing data.This isn't the right place to discuss this, and if you're saying that the best you can do is suggest better ways for other people to volunteer their time, I'm afraid you can stand in a long line. There are hundreds of suggestions for us to implement changes but often times people say exactly what you said "I don't have the time to help". I am part of the QA team, if you'd like to get involved with testing, triaging and making better and more efficient check systems, please feel free to contribute through QA, if not, I'm sure you can understand that a group of overworked volunteers will hit snags occasionally, we do our best and are constantly putting in tens of hours a week for no pay to make our process better.If you have specific suggestions on how to make QA better (which is what you're saying), please send emails to QA mailing list. The more specific the better as general comments aren't very useful.Just to give you an idea of what we face, over 1,000 bugs/enhancements were reported in February alone, we have a very small team to manually sort through these, confirm issues, and then of course help developers priortize. With millions of users worldwide, the ratio of QA testers/triagers to users becomes mind numbing.As these comments have clearly gone off from the main topic of the bug, I ask that you end it here and move it to the QA mailing list where it is more appropriate.forgot to say:@Pedro - thanks so much for so much work on this one. If you have just a little time a week to help out QA we would love to have you join our team :) Please feel free to email me directly, join our mailing list and of course chat with us on #libreoffice-qa :-D

Apologies for inconveniences.Thank you,Ferdouscaolanm->minhsien0330: This "works for me" with those fonts installed. So presumably its because I have additional fonts installed which fontconfig suggests as better replacements.So in order for me to attempt to reproduce this bug I need to a) get the full list of fonts you have installed so that I can synchronize my installed fonts with your installed fonts.fc-list -v > /tmp/fontlist.txtand attach /tmp/fontlist.txt hereb) get the output of "locale -a" because that can affect the suggested fallback font too.caolanm@fk: Open a new bug for your different problem which is unrelated to this issue.Createdfont listDear CaolÃ¡n McNamara:The fontlist.txt is attached here.And the result of "locale -a" is:CC.UTF-8en_US.utf8POSIXzh_TW.utf8Thanks a lot!Createdfont list (new)Sorry, I added and removed some fonts, so I generate a new font list here.Thanks a lot~The word processor should not substitute arbitrary fonts for documents and display random glyphs with them.caolanm->urmas; There's nothing arbitrary about it, if a font is missing or cannot render a requested glyph we request a suitable replacement from fontconfig.

id=58691	CreatedLO PivottableI created a pivottable with LO4.000b2. It works with some (less severe) problems: 1. bad performance with larger data tables (in a pivot table with 450 lines x 230 columns it takes up to 25 sec. to update after using the filter buttons), 2. column filter buttons become nonfunctional when they exceed the rectangular cell range of the pivot table (try to use the filter button "Datum" in the attached "Pivottable_Test.ods").However, when saving this document as Excel 2007/2010 (XLSX), and reopening, all pivottable functionality is lost: the table is still there, but without filter buttons and all the other logic behind. A showstopper! This exported file also shows the fat cell borders mentioned in #58356.In my opinion, the Pivottable seems to need a good amount of bugfixing and a more efficient code for being usable in everyday work. So, please don't add new features until the existing don't work. Thanks for reporting @paulchen.Confirmed, columns filter and save/load xlsx, issues.Wintx64UltimateVersion 4.0.0.0.beta2 (Build ID: 4104d660979c57e1160b5135634f732918460a0)Curious, changing the Data subtotal on a column field to automatic, makes the column filter again available for both columns (Datum & Probenummer).The pivot table functionality is lost when exporting into XLSX also with LO-3.6 and 3.5. So, it is not a regression => can't block the release => lowering the severity a bit.Note that the OOXML import/export filters are work in progress. It is being improved in every LO release.Kohei, Muthu, Noel, could you please have a look? I am not sure who of you works on the XLSX import/export.Changing platform to all because I also reproduce this in Linux (Ubuntu 13.10 and Fedora 20)***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***MABs should be priority highest.The master branch should do a better job on this.

id=59259	Run Impress (Debian GNU/Linux 64, confirmed by other person with Windows 7 x64, libreoffice 4.0RC1), select one of the following "master pages": sunset metropolis vintage.Then "File -> Print..."behaviour expected:the print dialog should show upWhat happens:program just freezes (CPU is not 100%, but even so also the UI, KDE in my case, seems trashing until you kill LiBo) I can confirm this behavior, using 'Sunset', 'Metropolis' or 'Vintage' layout. I also can add that selecting one of this 'Master pages' will result in a short 'freeze' (1 second or so). When file -> print, a complete freeze. After a while I can use the dialog again. Good catch Marco!All these templates are using SVG picture on the background. LO-4.0 started to use another library to read SVG pictures, so it is most likely related.I add some Draw and Writer hackers into CC.Hmm, I am able to print to file on openSUSE-12.2-x86_64 with 4.0.0.2 packages. But it takes ages.Observation: 1 slide in the generated postscript has the following size: + 5.1 MB with Sunset SVG background + 0.4 MB with DNA PNG backgroundI guess that we generate very high resolution when printing SVG pictures.Hmm, I would not block the 4.0.0 release because of this problem. The print takes ages but it is possible. .0 release is intended for early adopters and might include even annoying bugs. Though, we should fix it ASAP => slightly lowering severity and adding into MABs(In reply to)Well, let's say that 50% of Impress users are using those templates, and for them printing is essentially broken (takes ages = unusable/hangs/perception that does no work and it's frozen).In addition is a regression (don't know technically, but an user passes from a release where this works to one that does not)We are going to upset a lot of people and receive a lot of bad reviews due to this ("there is some new interesting feature but impress printing is broken, a sigh of the low quality of the suite/development/whatever").Do we have some hurry or better release when most problematic bugs are fixed?I would do the latterLook atplease.Something went wrong here, this one has nothing to do withJan Holesovsky committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-4-0":fdo#59259: Suppress the expensive parts when we are only writing to metafile.It will be available in LibreOffice 4.0.4.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

I therefore (for the first time)saved my presentation as a Microsoft ppt file and the result was disastrouswith lots of missing pictures and text when displayed using the projectorâsOffice Viewer, but appeared okay when I reimported back into Libre Officeon my computer.Saving it as a pptx file was even worse on the projector and it did notre-import correctly back into Libre Office.Any ideas?Best regards,JonathanSent from Laptop *From:**Sent:* 27 February 2013 12:27*To:**Subject:* [] Custom animation: only the first line is animated *<> on bug59629 <> from*(In reply to<>)> I'm sorrybut I don't get it: how can I install this fix?>The 4.0.1 update will have it (planned for next week)------------------------------You are receiving this mail because: - You are on the CC list for the bug.@JonathanIt's for the bug here, not for a projector who could not read a closed format like ppt or complex format like pptx /Oxml.

It makes a mess.If you insert ALL new lines with the enter key the problem does not occur.(In reply to)We naturally can't fix 4.0.0.3 without a time machine. 4.0.1 (due this week) will have this fixed - please only reopen this bug if you can *still* reproduce the problem with the prerelease builds fromPerfect with version 4.0.1.2Fixed is ok. Sorry.(In reply to)Please do not change the bug version! This version should be the oldest version of LibreOffice that reproduce the behavior.Changed to earliest version.@EVERYONE - please do not change any of the top information without understanding what we use that information for. We use comments to say we've tested it on newer versions, the version field should NEVER get newer, only older if we can confirm on older releases. Thank youThe problem is still present in 4.0.1 RC2 (4.0.1.2).Animated text is not working. The last lines in any text box are not animated at all.In addition, the background image that I set in the master slide (a simple blue rectangle) is not shown.One strange thing is that even if I downloaded and installed the 4.0.1.2 deb package (Ububtu 12.10, gnome shell) the "about" says 4.0.1.1 (Build ID: 400m0(Build:1)). Aptitude (packet manager) confirms that the version installed is 4.0.1.2.Is it possible that the libreoffice server is giving a 4.0.1.1 version mistakenkly named 4.0.1.2?Any workaround or suggestion?This bug really sucks. And tomorrow morning I should be teaching my class...Sorry. I got confused with the package isntallation. I had both the 4.0.1.1 and the 4.0.1.2 installed at the same time. I can now confirm that the animation bug is resolved in the 4.0.1.2 release.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Doesn't occur in 4.0.2.1 anymore.

None of the change are recordered in the recovery.This can be reproduced every time no matter size of document (even a blank page causes the issue). After te first crash, any new document cannot be open due to 'no sufficient rights to access the file'. When trying to make a launch through termonal, the message is "user <username> doesn't exist".This can be reporoduced independantly in a small office 3 computers with 5 users (similar instalations).The issue is critical as it makes the office suite not usable.gk Hi. I'm sorry you're having that problem. I tested this using Ubuntu 12.04, but with LO Version 4.0.0.2 (Build ID: 408fe71bd18616c467b3dcd7ab6756528ffcae2). I did not encounter this issue when trying to export as pdf, or print to file. I used existing and new documents. I only recently stopped using LO 3.4 on Ubuntu, and did not experience a similar issue, but I can't speak for 3.5 specifically.

next time put it on a file and attach the file so the bug is still easy to read.Did you install any specific fonts? If yes which ones and could you attach them?Could you try to retrieve the strace too? (see)I add some developers that could hack on MAC or did something with fonts into CC. I wonder if the backtrace might somehow help.IMHO, the strace would be helpful because if could point to the problematic font.Anyway, it seems to be somehow specific to your system. Such bugs, could not block releases with other useful fixes and improvements => lowering the severity a bit.yeah, its very likely triggered by a specific font, so we'd need to know what font is it. a strace would help with finding that outSorry for the delay. The font was causing the problem was Silicon.ttf (). When I removed it, I was able to retrieve the font list again.But, I'm sorry to tell you, LibreOffice was still crashing over and over again just clickin around on a random cell. The font list started to work when I removed that font, but LibreOffice was crashing all the time.I think it's something related the fonts anyway, dunno which one. I had to reinstall the system to fix the problem (first time in 6 years, I always upgraded since Panther).And, this is another hint for you: I did the Lion installation from scratch, I installed the Silicon font again, and it works, no more crashes. So the font itself is not the problem. It's something related fonts, but not that font in particular. I'm sure it's something relating fonts because LibreOffice failed when I have first installed, then removed a lot of fonts. I had the Silicon font installed for years, so it can't be the problem, but it was causing the crash on the font list apparently.I can check, but I'm not sure is still on my Time Machine backup, for the font list. That might help you? Tell me if I can recover some information for you.dedalo: on Lion installation from scratch, when you installed the Silicon font, you said you had no more crash but is the font list display ok?Yes Julien, it is and the Silicon is displayed on the list.Installing that specific Silicon font under MacOSX gives from the mac font installera) "1 serious error was found. Do not use this font, <corrupt font name>"b) "may cause system problems or even crashes if installed"which is a pretty scary set of warnings :-)anyway, even with it installed LibreOffice doesn't crash for me on MacOSX (and Linux version under valgrind with font installed is also silent), so we don't have a reproducible scenario.I think it's best to close this bug as it's gotten a bit confused and with freshly installed fonts it works. If there is information about a specific font that causes a reproducible crash then feel free to log a new bug about that font.

id=60270	This is the meta issue to track the most annoying bugs in LibreOffice 4.1.x releases. It helps developers to concentrate on bugs that are most critical for users. Also it helps users to be aware of potential problems.If anyone wants to raise a bug as âmost annoyingâ for the release, please add the ID of that bug to the field âDepends onâ, and donât forget to leave a comment here that explains in a few words why that bug should be privileged.For details, criteria and further instructions, please see I am marking this as NEW to get it out of our UNCONFIRMED list :-D Presumably, any bug here will be indeed....confirmed and NEWAdd "- EDITING: CRASH when 'Format - Bullets and Numbering'"- Causes thin gaps to appear in borders, borders look as if they are stitched together and jaggies appear on non-rectangular borders in print. Bug doesn't appear in OpenOffice which would make some users print the documents from OpenOffice to avoid this.I add "- CRASH when click 'Add' in EXTENSIONS Manager"I add "- FILEOPEN other document via document-hyperlink in LibO3.6-document fails with error message"Add 60945: 'File -> Save as' shows 'Open' dialog instead of "Save As" dialog => hard to safe filesI nominate: several icons are lost, mainly in the Navigator, Styles and Formatting and Formula bar of Calc.

Seems like a display bug only, because it is saved correctly.I nominate "- Cannot scroll horizontally using trackpad" (Mac OSX bug only, as far we can see) because of the regression 4.0 vs 4.1 and the fact it makes scrolling horizontally using the trackpad useless. You can only scroll in one direction.I add "- EDITING: CRASH when click on contents". More or less no editing possible with WriterI nominate "- Impress crashes on setting master pages" because of the regression 4.0 vs 4.1.I addbecause it makes LibreOffice unusable for Unity users.Add: It seems to be impossible to create new databaseAdding. Asian vertical mode is completely dysfunctional.

I think this bug is serious because now charts/copying is useles, slows down work and loses data.I nominate. It causes data loss and is a very common action (adding words to personal dictionary)I'd like to nominate:losing images when working with docx without extra backup of the files can have pretty bad consequences.(This bug exists since 3.5.3 but is still present in 4.1.0.1. I hope this is the right MAB.)Please don't add a known MAB to more than one version - otherwise it is impossible to see critical new bugs in 4.1.

Although personas provides no "useful" function in LibO, it is a great emotional aid in personalising LibO and adding company branding. Although I can manually bypass the problem, this would not be in the skill level of the normal user.AddedFormulas with error result disappear after reload, when file is saved as xls.Adding, data loss of formulas with error result when saving to .xlsAdding- EDITING: BUG: calc crashes on spell checkI would like to nominate. This bug is half fixed, for XLS files, but it's still not fixed for ODS files.It's an regression introduced in 4.1.I'm adding it here to keep it on dev radar. If you don't think it should be here please delete it.I propose- Cannot copy styles between different files and templates, I continuously have to close LO 4.1 and open LO 3.6 to transfer styles from documents to templates, especially for Calc.Chris"Writer incorrectly displays non-numbered list dot" Dot's are seen as unknown character since 4.1 beta 1Beta 2 sorryI added"Writer incorrectly displays non-numbered list dot" Dot's are seen as unknown character since 4.1 beta 2 sorry for the spamAdded regressions- FILEOPEN SMB File is Locked By Unknown User messageand- FILESAVE: Files locked after saved on network driveNote that it seems thatalso has slipped in 4.0.5I add- FILESAVE: Style Font name incompatible with older versions.

So two conclusions can be made:1. this bug (68927) must have been reintroduced in a version > 3.4.5and <= 3.6.5.22. the bugs 68927 and 62461 can *not* be the sameAddedWhen any text around in the cell format around @ format, this text is added to cell content when the file is reloaded.Added- FILESAVE: FILEOPEN: save document as docx and reopen result in an freeze/endless loop. It's an old bug from LO 3.6, but since 4.0 is approaching to EOL, I add it here.adding bugAdding, FILESAVE and FILEOPEN: Joined cells in table cause table distortion after save to doc and docx and reopen in LO.This is an old bug, first reported in Sep 2012, and still reproducable in 4.1.2.3. In my opinion, table distortion = data loss.adding- Other: field command "time (fixed)" does not work when used in a writer template file (regressions since 4.1.0.0rc1 IIRC)HiI am proposing #67370: automatic hyphenation is not visible in text files exported as tagged PDF. Since PDF/A-1 format forces tagging, PDF/A-1 are affected as well. And PDF/A-1 were supposed to be readable and accessible in long-term future. This will be huge issue for government, business and NGO users when they switch to 4.1.Seethere for bibisect log.Windows seems to be not affected by this issue. Mac OS X builds have not been tested.Best regardsMirosÅaw ZalewskiHi,Let me be 'brave' and add:- [EDITING] Selecting with mouse: too fast changing to next/previous page- EDITING: Large document with many pictures causes freezing in Writer when scrolling with scroll bar(In reply to)Of course, the real brave people will be the dev(s) that, seeing the progress of improvements and cleaning up, will dive into these smelly issues :)Adding- EDITING: cell is not updated when referenced cell becomes empty due to sortFixed in master, but worth to fix in 4.1. too?Addingre: structured outline limitations... and that anchor does point to my comment cherry-picking a relatively solve-able corner case. In legal documents, the ability to comply with court rules is important.because doing editing only to discover some list formatting is unexpectedly unchangeable is even more frustrating; I bet the author offeels the same way about their related problem.Adding: reproducible crash (SEGFAULT) under not-yet-determined conditions when switching focus from one window to the other (LibreOffice Base forms).please add bugdocx not saving page colorNominatedRegression which makes LibreOffice lose the ability to print some borders. Also seems to affect performance. Simple test document available and bibisect is completedAddedSeems like drag & drop is freezing up KDE4, also it looks like a regressionThis bug seems to be affecting quite a few users from the amount of comments/dupes.I would like to nominate, a regression in which pasting charts with "data series in rows" from Calc into Writer/Impress results in badly mangled charts. This makes LO 4.1 difficult to use for presenting results. Bug is not present in LO 4.0.(In reply to)should be a duplicated of, see my comments there, so 68249 should not be on this list.is already on MAB4.1 list.Hi John & suokunlong - thanks for the nominations, John you're right that was a very annoying bug :-)I add"Help -> About LibreOffice" Logo not smooththis issue doesn't affect productivity and is just a matter of aesthetics... however I feel that this ugly about logo could be used against the LibO project to discredit the quality of the project.I mean, somebody could argue that "LibO comes out with a scrambled about box, would you dare editing your documents with such a buggy software?"I nominatewhich is a regression freezing LibreOffice in some case.I add- EDITING: Crash on nested table delete (previously titled "Copy Paste Crash"). While the specific situation may not be too common, I experience some crashes with recent LoDev 4.1 that I can't trace, so at least solving this one would rule this out.adding- properties dialog expands to screen size if long comment is enteredadded because the API does not use a PNG image that is embedded in the ODF file in addition to SVG drawing.Adding, LO shows 2D pie chart as 3D (and shows 3D as 2D) in xls and xlsx.adding- when multiple spreadsheets containing VBA macros are opened simultaneously, the last opened document is always considered the "Active" Document/Worksheet/Cell, even if a previous spreadsheet has the focus. Additionally, if the "last opened" document is closed, references to something in the "Active" context fail completely.Nominated- writer hangs if you open a doc with a table in the footer. This is a recent regression (4.1), the bug has been bibisected.Thanks allNominating Bug "70499 - FILEOPEN Cannot select unprotected cells in XSLX sheet with worksheet protection" as it is an issue with anyone needing to fill in partially protected xlsx forms, which potentially affects an array of different cases.was a dupe of.I nominatewhich is a regression from 4.1.3. It make the functions wizard in Calc less interesting to use. (ATM the bug is marked for version 4.2 but it is reproducible in 4.1.5.0.0+ and I guess in 4.1.4.1 but this version number is not available in BZ).Best regards. JBFAddingthat has the same cause as. Present in 4.1.4.1Add: Text disappear when editing a 90deg Textbox.This feature worked without problems in LO 4.0.x. So it may prevent users to update to the most actual version.- Fax-Wizard - Personal Data are only partial adoptedThe wizards are available to start a new fax (etc.) document from scratch. If the personal data are not adopted in the created fax document (and are not in the correct order) the wizard is not useful. This is also a very visible issue, because normal office users will create documents using a wizard.I nominate "- Impress hangs on creating new style"I consideras highly critical. It practically means no conditional formatting until fixed. I found many duplicates, conditional formatting seems really messy in many ways. Evil thinkers consider it "a good example for what goes wrong in LibreOffice development" .This bug must be fixed.add- FORMATTING: Toggling off bold/italic does not turn it off, but instead applies no-bold/no-italic. This messes up any style afterwards that has bold/italic in it (until Clear Direct Formatting is used) ..Adding: one Unix, one cannot anymore open / modify embedded databases on a non-local filesystems.I nominateFunction GETPIVOTDATA does not work as it did upto 4.0.6I nominateGETPIVOTDATA does not work as it did up to 4.0.6Nominating:- Default value of "Show cell grid lines" checkbox on sidebar. Highly visible new feature semi-broken, several duplicates, seems annoying enough.- SIDEBAR: Wrong Paragraph spacing values after opening Properties deck. Again, new and visible feature half-broken, making the sidebar pretty annoying to use for me.Add- Writer's UI crashes when scrolling pages if formatting marks are visible: the work of Writer is broken in Windows XP within a single release (between 4.1.4.2 and 4.1.5.0.0+).Added- very simple test document is locking LibreOffice on multiple platforms.

Only bugs not yet reported reproducible in 4.1 or 4.2 should remain.NominatingIt's almost impossible to open that specifix XLSX file.- FORMATTING: Formating numbers in Data Pilot table does not work anymore (regression)Nominating this bug, because it is a regression (to 4.0.0.x and still here in 4.2.0.4) and because it is really annoying to do the formating for each and every data pilot table / pivot table once and once again after the data is refreshed.(In reply to)FWIW, this never worked, so not a regression. If it ever appeared to have worked before, it was a fluke.added, comments lost on the page that is copied to another one. SophieNominated- Impossible to copy just values from spreadsheet into a table in Writer - inherited by OOo but quite annoying.a couple dupes and a few users involved. Plus I guess it was reported during OOo days and had 100+ "votes" on their infra.Nomintated- results of simple formulas are being quasi lost with xlsx but if you just edit the formula by removing the last character ')' and then put the character back the formula works as expected.- UI mouse pointer disappears during presentation and does not come back after exiting presentationNominating this bug, because it is a regression (to 4.0 series and still in 4.2) and because it is really annoying, I have to restart LibreOffice in order to use my mouse again.Nominating- Password-protected documents saved unencrypted for auto-recoveryBug is serious security issue. Regression apparently appeared in 3.4.2.1 and is assumed to be still present in the 4.2 branch.Hereby I nominate "- LibreOffice Writer text highligthing is not compatible with Microsoft Word DOC and DOCX (highlighting transforms to background color)"(In reply to)Seconded. It's the most important problem in exchanging document with my collegues at work.I nominate "- Detective "Trace Precedents" or "Trace Dependents" pointing to a different tab does not provide reference cells".Though the bug or rather missing feature is old I consider it to be very important. I find it impracticable to understand complex spreadsheets without a "detective", which works across worksheets. Therefore, I consider MS Excel to be necessary for understanding a complex spreadsheet, even if one works primarily with LibreOffice Calc.Removed- was an enhancement request that does not belong on the list.(In reply to)done :)AddedSample ods file crash at opening.please do not add new bugs here. the 4.1.x branch won't probably have other release after 4.1.6. new annoying bugs should be posted to the mab4.2 or mab4.3 lists.existing mab4.1 which are still reproducible in 4.2.x branch can be moved to the mab4.2 list.Ok. all existing mab4.1 have been moved to the mab4.2 list.marking this as CLOSED FIXEDusing spareadsheet, when i try to add new line in Cell ... means writing more than one line in a cell, save changes, close the file and re-open it, cell content appears all in single line. new line character is lost. i'm saving my file as .xlsx file.

General input/output error." and that's it.The solution here is, that files showing wrong svg-s and eps-s earlier, by now do not load at all any longer.Meaning, files created with LO 3.6 simply cannot open any longer. I don't know if this really has to do with this bug, but I think so, since all other files (not containing these image types) open properly. I wonder, if this ought not be put at the upper echelon of all bugs!?Then, the name of this software should be changed.We cannot call this software as LibreOffice 4.You can call this, for example, LimitOffice, PityOffice, whatever you want, but other than LibreOffice.The reason is so obvious that I don't need to say.Is somebody doesn't understand, I will write.@taka:Yep. I noticed you re-opened because someone had 'dup'-ed 76359 to here. The problem does apply to ALL AND ANY .eps here; and to ALL AND ANY .svg here; though the .svg-s are often only modified, cut off on a margin, or whatnot.I agree, a software that runs happily without .eps and without .svg is totally useless, at least to me: because these are features that MS Office had always neglected. I, as computer scientist, consider all sorts of .jp[e]g and stuff child-play. The only useful and sustainable method to draw an image is one with infinite resolution; not a pixel- or block-based 'little helper'. With Libreoffice falling back to the lowly abilities of MS Office, I fail to see any reason to stick with it. (I know what I'll hear next: "that's the beauty of choice!") But those voices will be voices of nincompoops, because regression is not "choices" but sh***y project management.It's because of bugs like this that I don't think LibreOffice is viable for scientific work. I'm not sure why I stopped using Latex but it is clearly superior to LibreOffice (and MS Office). Also, now there are many web sites that let you collaborate on Latex documents (for free). With the ease of interweaving R computations and graphics into documents, there is really no reason to use LibreOffice. The fact that this bug has not been fixed in over a year (and the maintainers of LibreOffice could not care less) clearly means that LibreOffice is not being used by researchers. So I've re-learned how to use Latex and doubt I'll ever use LibreOffice again. (MS Office is even worse - you can't format numbers in Word tables - explains why you see so many poorly designed tables.)Let's give more visibility to this bug by nominating it as MAB.Here are some reasons:- old bug- regression- impacts at least a whole category of users (scientific ones)- no workaround- seems to happen with every eps file (if not, any example of an odp containing eps which works well?)About this last one, if it's confirmed, we should change the title of this tracker and indicate that all eps are concerned and so fdo#76359 would be a dup indeed.Thorsten/CaolÃ¡n: I don't know if it's a rendering/vcl problem or Impress/Draw specific pb.As noted on, with the ImageMagick application installed, Windows builds of LibreOffice do import and render EPS content into Impress, Writer and Draw.But can confirm that for Windows builds of LibreOffice with ImageMagick also installed--they do not render slide elements during Slide show presentation wef. the 3.6.x -> 4.0.0 transition. On Windows 7 sp1, 64-bitThe "RNE Sample for.odp" from Roman E's 2012-11-28 Test kit, and "example-eps-problem.odp" example presentation attached to this bug renders correctly in both edit and during slideshow with Version 3.6.5.2 (Build ID: 5b93205). And are also both correctly rendered in edit and Slideshow mode inVersion 3.6.7.2 (Build ID: e183d5b).On the same system for the two presentations the EPS render in edit mode but do not render (i.e. no image rendered just the slide title) for the Version 4.0.6.2 (Build ID: 2e2573268451a50806fcd60ae2d9fe01dd0ce24) build.On the same system the EPS renders in edit mode but is not rendered in SlideshowVersion: 4.1.5.3Build ID: 1c1366bba2ba2b554cd2ca4d87c06da81c05d24Finally on the same Windows system EPS no longer renders in edit mode nor slideshow mode. Just a black image fill is present in edit mode--and slide has no image.Version: 4.2.0.4Build ID: 05dceb5d363845f2cf968344d7adab8dcfb2ba71Even if the eps file contains a bitmap preview, it does not work. :-(Until the bug is corrected, you have the following workaround for new presentations: use Draw to convert your EPS file in bitmap.step 1: insert the eps image in a new Draw documentstep 2: select and copy the image by ctrl+Cstep 3: go to Impress and do paste special as bitmap.Best regards.

When I search the bug list for SVG, I hit a good number of people who have likewise lost all abilities to show/export SVG-s.(e.g. 62284, 64075, 76988, 76353)Before that, someone with more insight ought to confirm that both are actually linked. At least here, using EPS and SVG, both disappeared at the same time from my slide shows and exports - with the up[down]grade from 3.6 to 4.X.X.And someone to change the title, please. This applies to all images; it is a generic problem. The title suggests otherwise.

Have the outstanding MAB 4.1for handling SVG previews (wef 4.0.0 converting to PNG rather than rendering as vector) on hold to "do it right in 4.2"Alas, so the troubles with the transitions 3.6 to 4.X.X remain unresolved for me, and a number of others in the scientific community (see, by Rick), since my images are mostly in svg, and rendered 'okay' earlier. Yes, I filed the svg bug as well, last year.

It can be seen that LibreOfficeDev_4.1.0.0_Win_x86 displays and print bitmap (PNG image) losing quality.CreatedApacheOO-3.4.1 loses quality It is possible that this bug came from the ASF:"LibreOffoce 4.0 ReleaseNotes: Draw: - Multi-image support in ODF allowing a bitmap + SVG representation eg.

It shouldn't really affect LibreOffice at all.So - I'm trying to unwind the user-visible bug from- I would hope that we would load/render the SVG fallback properly, however it is clear that the new SVG code produces rather lower quality output than the older one - though it is retained as vectors :-)Can you be more specific on the problems - I see some pretty serious drop-offs in SVG rendering here as the main bug: I see only six of the large document icons rendered eg.CreatedThis image shows the file in Inkscape.Createdsimple file with 2 SVGConvert SVG image in a PNG bitmap takes a lot of time because DPI is changing and PNG smoothes. Compare the time required for programs (LO-3.6.5 vs. LO-4.x.x) to open this simple file.Save the file in LibreOffice-4.x.x and look at its size.This's not quality loss, this's corruption.(In reply to)Michael,LO 4.0 rasterize SVG to PNG and stores both original SVG and corresponding PNG at the same position on the page.LO 3.6 doesn't read it the same way and "cleans-up" an ODF file by removing original SVG.So if you resave original SVG-containing ODF with 4.0 and then resave result from 3.6, you will end up with a file with PNG (only) instead of SVG.If I properly understand how ODF works, probably PNG could be stored by 4.0 as 'ObjectReplacement'. I believe in such a case it would not conflict with existing SVG.What I'm not sure though is how LO 3.6 will react on it. Eg. will it take 4.0 rendered PNG or render SVG on its own? In the latter case the whole idea of storing PNG would be destroyed.(In reply to)That probably worth a separate bug, to compare SVG rendering in LO 4.0 and 3.6 and track regressions (if any).I think the good (by time consuming) approach would be to run both over W3C test set.Createdfilter's work (AOO-3.4.1 vs. LO-4.0.3)Michael,Apache OpenOffice-3.4.1 uses a bilinear filter to output each additional PNG image. This is a quick filter of low quality. Therefore:- Apache Draw opens the file with the time that is acceptable to the user;- no messages in The Apache Bugzilla.LibreOffice-4.x.x uses the Lanczos filter to output each additional image:âRelease Notes 3.6 > Core: â¦ Added Lanczos algorithm for resizing of images and use it instead of interpolate algorithm. This change has increased the quality of images when reducing image resolution in PDF export. fdo#46378 (TomaÅ¾ Vajngerl)âThis filter determines the transparency of the color at each point of each additional PNG image. Therefore, the filter works slowly, but with high quality.I found the bug because of this.You can compare works of filters if you look the picture in the attachment. In the image: at the top - Apache bilinear filter; at the bottom â the Lanczos filter (LibreOffice_4.x.x).I think that we have needs for return to LibreOffice-3.6.5.Hm, much more serious. Read:(filters and storage)(filters and storage)(Impress)(Writer; ODT file contains the backup PNG image)FWIW, this is perfectly valid ODF, changing title accordingly. C.f. the zeroOrMore image/ole/applet etc. inside draw:frame in the odf1.2 RNG schema. It is of course unfortunate that 3.6.x picks the less-ideal graphic.CreatedODT and ODP files by LO-3.6.5 and LO-4.1.0(In reply to)--You try to work with files (an attachment) in LibreOffice-3.6.5, then - in LibreOffice-4.x.x.LO-4 makes stop using SVG files in the ODT, ODP and ODG documents.Is not that enough to go back to the old algorithm?--P.S. I understand that reducing the severity of the error is the most correct and shortest route to success.(In reply to)--I think that:A. If the patch provides good work to other Office programs, but hinders the work of LibreOffice, this patch should be canceled.B. The user of such a program can start using LibreOffice or perform these steps. 1. Extract the SVG file from the ODF container: 2. Export SVG file into a PNG image using Inkscape. 3. Replace in the ODF file native SVG drawing at this PNG image.CreatedKarbon-2.6.2 opened a file created by LibreDraw-4.x.xNo comment...I got bitten by this when I used my laptop to display a presentation created on my desktop (which has been updated to a newer version). The rather complex lineart with text that I used was rendered unreadable.Michael, the user visible bugs are:1) I insert lineart because it is _required_ for my use. As a user of libreoffice I do not care about implementations that cannot display it. If you want to fix such cases, convert the svg to ODF drawings, or make it possible to disable such compatibility features.2) Filesize is unnecessarily increased by saving PNG in addition. Again, such compatibility options belong in the separate "compatible" ODF format, or should be activated by user-intervention.3) this 'feature' as currently implemented breaks compatibility with older versions of libreoffice and external tools (see previous comment). In the case of LO-3.x, only the png will be shown and subsequently saved, and thus causes a severe compatibility problem (the vector art is lost for ever and replaced by a badly rendered png). Again, the point of vector art is to prevent having bitmaps in the file. I do not like LO trying to second-guess my goals by doing such conversions behind my back. Its like saving bad quality JPGs for every embedded PNG. Such things are nicely available by right clicking the image where you can modify the compression setting. Same could be done for SVG, but do not do it automatically!btw, from the spec:"Each child element of a frame is a different representation of the same content. The order of content elements reflects the document author's preference for rendering, with the first child element being preferred. That means that consumers should render the first child element that they support. A frame may contain multiple content elements, but shall contain at least one content element."In most cases, it is obvious that the document author, (i.e. me) prefers the content that he actually inserted. It may well be that older versions of OO.org will fail with this (that seems to have been Armin's reasoning for putting png first), but that only stresses the need for configuration of this feature and is not an excuse for breaking the spec.CreatedPNG by LibO-4.2.0 alpha1LidreOfficeDev-4.2.0.0 began to understand the mask. But, nevertheless, problems arise when creating PNG (see attachment):1. Object "Globe (Web template)" is lost.2. Size (in pixels) is less than the size of the original SVG file. The time required to display the image on the screen has not changed. This is indirect evidence that the filter each time re-converts the SVG file to PNG image and PNG, embedded in the file when you first save, do not use.(In reply to)Proof: 1. File 410.odg extracted from the archive (). 2. File 410.odg\Pictures\10000201000005F3000001484CF701B4.png extracted and then opened for viewing with using the external program such as IrfanView. 3. Start LibO Draw 4.1.x and open the file 410.odt. 4. Compare the pictures.(In reply to)Sorry, start LibO Draw 4.2.0.0_alpha1 and open the file Â«410.odtÂ».I raised the status to "critical" because:1. LibO-4.x.x creates an additional PNG file which API does not use.2. Broken continuity versions (3.6.x vs 4.x.x).3. Earlier versions of the program (3.6.7) do its work much better.Caolan McNamara committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":Resolves: fdo#62461 put preferred image firstThe patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.Ordered with favourite first, followed by fallback. Seems to work ok, testing appreciated. Proposed for 4-1 asthanks. Will test early next week!(In reply to)Surely you changed the status to unconfirmed by mistake : without explanation, just after a patch has been pushed.Changed back to fixed.Best regards. JBFA bug shouldn't be listed at two MABs, removing it from the second (4.2) one.Tested by recompiling fedora (fc20 branch) libreoffice with a patch based on the one in. Confirmed that older versions of libreoffice (3.6.7) now correctly read the svg file. However, saving in that version will drop the png copy from the file (cannot be helped, and is better than dropping the svg).I assume that Armin put the png first to facilitate backwards compatability with OO.org versions that did not include svg support. Apparently these versions did not follow the spec well enough to check for alternative fallback images. However, i did not go through the trouble to test this. We should, however, ask ourself the question what is the purpose of this fallback image if there is no use-case for it (i.e. the software that does not support svg, also does not know how to read fallback images).In my opinion, interoperability between LO 3.6.x and 4.x is more important than with ancient OO.org versions, so I think the new way is a more sane default. The user-visible bug for me personally is thus fixed.Whether the original reporter is happy with the resolution I do not know as problems may remain:- interoperability with 3rd party programs not dealing well with multiple images- not asking for user confirmation and defaulting to including bitmap copies for vectorart images, thereby increasing file-size (perhaps without reason as explained above).JBF: sorry, I quickly replied and it seems bugzilla defaults to putting unconfirmed in the bug status window when I add comments, I did not notice and thus inadvertently changed the status.Seems the patch will be rejected for 4.1:Also, it is not clear to me whether Michael understood that this breaks compatibility with LO in a minor way in order to maintain compatibility with much older OO versions in a bigger way.(I could be convinced by a good argumentation, but the point seems not to have been addressed).Since this is a 4.1mab, I guess it does now make sense to reopen.I propose an alternative fix for 4.1 by making the order depended on a setting.Most obvious would be to save it in the wrong way for the 1.2 Compat ODF format.(and this would avoid adding extra options).Comments?Changed importance to reflect the new policy - SophieSince the only 4.1.X version to be released is 4.1.6 and I suppose this one will contain only critical bug fixes (like crashes for example), I propose to close this tracker.Just to be sure everything is still ok on 4.2 branch, I made the following quick test with 4.2 sources updated some days ago:- create a brand new file on Writer- insert SVG- save in odt- rename odt->zip- unzip- check svg is before png it's ok.Any thought?lets keep this closed, reopening bugs is really problematic. If there is still a bone of contention in some area I think its now better to open a new bug about that

It might be related to the system libraries used by the Ubuntu build => adding Ubuntu maintainer into CC.Anyway, the autofilter in the document behaves strange way: + If I sort the column "A" descending, it moves the title line to the row "79". I would expect that the title line stays in the row "1". This problems go away when I remove the filter and create it again only for the columns "A-L". By other words, only for the columns that have some string in the title cell. + Also I had troubles to remove the filter. I had to choose both menu entries: "Data/Filer/Remove Filter" and "Data/Filter/Hide Autofilter". I am not sure how is this supposed to work. Maybe there were more filters defined at the same time.I add some Calc hackers who could comment on this.The freeze is not reproducible with the official build.

id=66232	LO 4.1.0.1 on Win7x64; IE10When clicking on a hyperlink to a .odt file and selecting Open, the file isn't opened.If LO isn't open yet, the task manager shows that soffice.bin and soffice.exe processes are started, and soffice.exe displays activity and consumption of memory, until it reaches ~25 MB memory consumption. Then it seems to hang: no memory usage change, no CPU use. No UI is displayed. However, if in this state I try to open another document from a local drive, it is opened normally. If LO is already started, it simply doesn't open the document from a web page.In both cases, after such attempt to load a document by clicking a hyperlink, LO cannot be closed (neither by clicking the cross at top right, nor by File->Exit LO). Kill process is needed.As a testcase, I tried some documents from Bugzilla, e.g.from.IIRC, neither 4.0.4 nor 3.6.x had this problem. Correction:LO 3.6.3.2 cannot open the links when it is not opened in advance, but it doesn't "hang"; instead, it displays the message box saying the following:"LibreOffice 3.6Unknown option: -EmbeddingUsage: soffice [options] [documents...]Options:<... a long list of command line options ...>"Clicking the OK button closes LO.If it is already started, it opens such files normally, and no problems to close LO after that.The behaviour of 3.6.3 differs from what happens in 4.1; besides, it seem to be fixed in. That's why I beleive that this is a distinct bug, and don't set version to an older version.This only happens if the MIME type of the downloaded file is set correctly (e.g., application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text), and no download managers are used.IE shows two dialogs before trying to open the file: first is to choose what to do: Open, Save or Save As. Second (after choosing Open) is security warning saying that "A website wants to open web content using this program on your computer" and soffice.exe doesn't have a valid signature.When the opening fails, three events are generated by this bug in the Application Log: Application Error 1000 (faulty application soffice.bin 4.1.0.0, faulty module emserlo.dll 4.1.0.1, exception 0xc0000005), and two Windows Error Reporting events 1001.Windows 8LibreOffice - 4.1 RC1LibreOffice - 4.0.4.2I can confirm the behavior on 4.1 but not on 4.0 so indeed a regressionNew - confirmedCritical - opening a document directly from web browser is common task - with IE still being the default of Windows (who knows why...) we should expect 4.1 to open the file just like it did in 4.0. Furthermore, the lock of the software makes it a bit more serious.Highest - very common thing to want to doAndras, Christian - any ideas ? some signing problem on Windows ?I tried LO 4.1.0.2 in Windows 8 (IE10) and LO 4.1.0.1 on Windows 7 (IE10). I reproduced the bug on Windows 8 but not on Windows 7, which is confusing, because the reported had the bug under Windows 7.However, I did not see anything in Event Viewer's Application log. Also, I did not see any problem with signatures.I compared the Process Monitor output of LO 4.0.4 and LO 4.1.0.2 and I see no difference, the .odt file was opened on both case. I suspect that the bug is somewhere in desktop/source/app, IE10 starts LO in headless state or something like that.CreatedDialogs screenshotsJust some clarification:there's no problem with signature (I suppose). I may have made slightly misleading descriptions above. Let's try to be more clear this time :)When I open example link fromfrom MS IE browser, it will naturally emit these dialogs:1. To choose the action: Open / Save / Save As.2. To confirm the action of the LibreOffice program installed on the computer to interact with the web page (thus breaking the IE protected mode).They are usual dialogs, that don't have anything strange.I only wanted to show the exact steps required to reproduce the dug. Because if you have, say, a download manager that intercepts the download and calls LO itself, then you will not see these dialogs, and will be unable to reproduce the bug. Similarly, if you try to download a file that have not MIME properly set, then IE will simply download the file and then start its associated program, instead of doing this "interaction of program and WEB page" thing, in which case you will not see these dialogs, and will be unable to reproduce the bug.Hope this helps. Please ask if you need some additional info.OK, I reproduced the bug with Windows7/IE10, too.I compared the command lines of LibreOffice's invocations.Windows XP - IE8 (good):-o C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\LYH5XXZ4\bug[1].odt --writer Windows 7 - Firefox (good):C:\Users\timar\AppData\Local\Temp\bug-2.odtWindows 7/8 - IE10 (bad):--nodefault --nologo -EmbeddingThe filename is not passed vie the command line, yet I see it in the Process Monitor, so it is passed by other means.The --nologo --nodefault switches come from the registry, for example for .odt from HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{F616B81F-7BB8-4F22-B8A5-47428D59F8AD}\LocalServer32This explains, why opening works even from IE10, when LibreOffice is not installed (just extracted to disk with msiexec /a, a.k.a. administrative install), because in this case nothing is written to registry.The real question is, why did LibreOffice's behaviour change between 4.0 and 4.1. 4.0 works with the same registry settings.Fridrich - you were looking for Windows specific regressions to look into ? :-) this looks like a nice one ...(In reply to)Adding Repro tags to the Whiteboard per Joel's repro notes.I could not reproduce the bug, when I took embedserv sources from 4.0 and build 4.1 with it.I bisected it, and it turned out that Noel Grandin's commit broke it.(In reply to)I assume thatis wrong there and the last line should readinstead.Thanks, it works with this fix, indeed.Andras Timar committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#66232 fix opening files via COM serverThe patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

Affects all chart types.I suggest this bugWhen insert symbols (like U+0301, U+0300, U+0340, U+0341), which apply to the previous symbol, insertion process doesn't work properly. Seems like it uses wrong font.It slows down the work so much (as you have to use "workaround"), that often it's easier to work in notepad and then copy\paste certain text into Writer. This is not normal work.I found it in 4.2.3 but maybe the bug is also in earlier versions.Add: cannot paste anything into the new inline input fields, defeating much of their functionalityReOne obvious use for the input field is for serial or identification numbers that must be printed on several different forms or several times in one page, information that is often provided from another electronic source and which is extremely prone to human error if manually retyped instead of copied.The current implementation breaks the ability to paste this kind of information into a template that was designed around the old method.The entire interface is currently designed to make the user think that whatever they need to do to edit an input field should be done by clicking and then inserting the information and not by using a non-obvious keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-F9) or going into the variables menu in a manner that defeats the entire purpose of an "input" field.We're talking about a difference of maybe 1-3 seconds for the old implementation versus 10-20 seconds for each field that requires pasted data. When you're dealing with dozens of these fields in an office full of distractions and urgent interruptions (the kind where you must open up a new document and work on something else, meaning you lose your place in what you were doing before) this adds up to significant loss of productivity.Nominating: Setting default language to "None" doesn't stick, but reverts to "English USA".

People like me are trying to find a stable version of LO to install on office computers. But if MAB lists are cleared then there is no way of knowing how stable each version is. If stableness can be measured by the number of MAB bugs that is.Since the MAB4.1 has been cleared so just how stable 4.1 is? 4.2 is supposed to be stable (still?) but just look at the number of MAB Bugs.At least please don't clear this list until 4.2 reaches its EOL."At least please don't clear this list until 4.2 reaches its EOL."What I meant to say is that please don't clear this list until 4.3 becomes stable (or still).(In reply to)Please, don't discuss this on the MAB list.

Thank you for checking.I assumed 4.2.7 was out already as (1) I already got a 4.2.7 update on Ubuntu a few days ago and (2) the release plan states that 4.2.7 should have been out by the 26th of October (yesterday).So I am sorry if in fact 4.2.7 is not officially out yet, I just had two good reasons to believe it was.I am aware of the the "exact procedures". I have participated in MAB transfers before. In the wiki, the following is written:"If there are no further releases of a LibreOffice version (or âbranchâ; e.g., 3.5.x), we close the MAB tracking bug for that version, and move all remaining MAB listed for that version to the MAB tracking bug for the next version â you do not need to do that yourself."I assumed 4.2.7 was out, therefore I knew there was no further release for the 4.2 branch. I then asked Kevin to nominate that bug in 4.3 MAB as this is what should be done according to the wiki (no use of adding a MAB if no extra bugfix version is planned). This not me starting a "migration", even though I think we should get cracking on that before the 4.2 EOL as MABs hanging out here after 4.2.7 will have no visibility at all (and, once again, it is what is recommended on the wiki).Thank you.sorry for sounding rude in the previous post.the 4.2.7 is not officially out yet but besides this I ask everybody here to hold on migrating mab4.2 to the mab4.3 list.It's better to wait a few weekes for the exact 4.2.x EOL to be sure that no critical issue pops out in the meantime and that no extra release will be necessary.(In reply to tommy27 from)No worries. Sure, that actually makes a lot of sense. It should be worded that way on the wiki to make it clear for everybody then, I am sure most QA people agree on that.ThanksLibO 4.2.7 has been finally released today.as said before the END OF LIFE of the 4.2.x branch is set on november 19th.please do not start any mab4.2 to mab4.3 migration until then.anyway feel free to retest the current mab4.2 which are still open [1] against the 4.3.x branch (4.3.3 released today) or against 4.4.x master, and post a new comment in the report page of that specific bug telling your findings (still reproducible, not reproducible, changed, etc. etc.)I'll personally move all residual 4.2mabs into the 4.3mab list after november 19th, so again do not start any migration until then.[1]adding- FILEOPEN: LibO 4.2.x incorrectly changes row height - various issues related/ look the same, - at least one duplicate, - bibisected, - clear example to reproduceAddingand. A feature was back ported to the stable 4.2.7 release. This new, incompatible sort breaks many peoples spreadsheets.(Seeand its many dupes) The necessary fixes were not back ported, so sorting with 4.2.7 or 4.3.2 can result in data loss.I nominate bug:Cross reference handling broken when exporting to doc / docxSame bug still exists in 4.3 ()I suggest to add this- "OpenSymbol font is not retained after an upgrade", that surfaces graduallyNominate- Document crashes when editing tables. Causes data loss for any unsaved data.

id=66924	I load the attached slide deck, switch to master page view; select slide 2 in the left-hand slide sorter and try to delete the creative-commons picture.As soon as I try to select in the items on that page, I switch (as if by magic) to slide 1 - and the images disappear; that looks pretty odd to me. Createdsample slides.I see it the build from 4-1-0 branch as well.Thorsten, Muthu, could you please have a look, ASAP?I am not sure whether we should block the 4.1.0 release because of this. It is impossible to edit master slide because it does not stay in the master page view. On the other hand, it probably does not cause any data loss.In fact it seems that it very difficult to leave to master mode: if you close the master view and choose to edit another slide, you go back in the master view.You need to close the master view at least two times before being able to edit the slide.I get the same behavior with and without the sidebar.Version tested : Version: 4.1.1.0.0+ (Build ID: 48bcea3710f14091e2e4fd078a31f278bce0c19)Best regards. JBFI did some more testing and here is my observation: + I am able to edit the first master slide in any presentation + I am NOT able to edit the other master slides if I choose them using the left hand slide sorter. If I click anywhere in the other master slide it jumps back to the previously edited slide; it means: + it jumps back to the first master slide if you did some editing before + it even leaves the "master view" and jumps back to the "normal view" if you did not not do anything else before (did not edit 1st master slide; did not edit other slides in the normal view A workaround seems to be to click on the first master slide in the central edit window and navigate to the other master slide using the [Pgdn] button. Then I am able to edit them. + I have troubles to leave the "master view". If I edit a master slide, leave the "master view" and try to edit the real slide, it jumps back to the "master view". A workaround is to close the "mast view" once again; then it stays in the normal view. + IMPORTANT: I see these problems only with more master slides. I do not see them in presentations with only single master slideThis bug is nasty but it affects only power users who could use the workarounds or wait for a bugfix release. We need to fix this for 4.1.1 but I would not block the 4.1.0 release because of this.I have mentioned it at.I am going to increase the priority but lower the severity to critical.It seems that David reset priority and severity to the older values when adding himself to CC :-)bibisect log:# bad: [4118d739dbd71e16057ea926ef3ef696025d3b67] source-hash-5bd6a5110bb812f82a81e73422a7b14851f84441# good: [68ce28f8d3ca05b1329580ed9f3e6ba0c82fbb26] source-hash-9f0f289c51765c671cbc8ef317c81e6fa42c6718git bisect start 'master' 'latest'# good: [e877ef94e2df78928f4c2af3ba7c99657f4f1886] source-hash-e46564a0a6a74da90785a1b910d33e2b5bfdcfd9git bisect good e877ef94e2df78928f4c2af3ba7c99657f4f1886# skip: [d43a96e8f17f73bd4be6af586132358d2883500f] source-hash-b2d08d759ee755cb5722553e01fb6d007ac9ffbegit bisect skip d43a96e8f17f73bd4be6af586132358d2883500f# skip: [05028c83ffea91506baec9829872a8bfa72a4e40] source-hash-59db0cb6752f269893e2697bf561643aec92bdf1git bisect skip 05028c83ffea91506baec9829872a8bfa72a4e40# bad: [700dad893e4ac8f865dfc7a047022f3e1b0bd3c1] source-hash-20e1181461adaae3289a5ef943ec5c4b75cc1570git bisect bad 700dad893e4ac8f865dfc7a047022f3e1b0bd3c1# good: [556e6277d7ae436a4bee1d8f9760b5238b8932b4] source-hash-d89012691b53def37118b0d892b50476d4e987b7git bisect good 556e6277d7ae436a4bee1d8f9760b5238b8932b4# bad: [78e8a3ced23d601da8a2357daf03a3e8f22c16a6] source-hash-1fadebef054b811d8d6487d45d76dea1990e1268git bisect bad 78e8a3ced23d601da8a2357daf03a3e8f22c16a6# good: [850682b3d95da8ae1a599c1a5e9064a480d13d76] source-hash-0314533d3ba5a2601bc18037c4a1fbc6a54910d3git bisect good 850682b3d95da8ae1a599c1a5e9064a480d13d76# skip: [51f094cf62f3f4b4f68f9c77f052d896a97e04e6] source-hash-0143805a565418d2a114c16b7eeba3b784176d9egit bisect skip 51f094cf62f3f4b4f68f9c77f052d896a97e04e6# good: [c648b138202c9f97ac5ca8b39e08117486839adf] source-hash-cdad97557a729ecbbe0236f7998647c5249a005fgit bisect good c648b138202c9f97ac5ca8b39e08117486839adf# bad: [790409f95b1bc4fc76e1e78c1395ed692a184ca8] source-hash-5dc41015ed10d4b4bd0eaa59e8cd6c0b1b96cc04git bisect bad 790409f95b1bc4fc76e1e78c1395ed692a184ca8# good: [0ab93000f1bffa3fa728fc7a673b722277b1b241] source-hash-08bb8fca4144608237418d64b1479840c408256fgit bisect good 0ab93000f1bffa3fa728fc7a673b722277b1b241# only skipped commits left to test# possible first bad commit: [790409f95b1bc4fc76e1e78c1395ed692a184ca8] source-hash-5dc41015ed10d4b4bd0eaa59e8cd6c0b1b96cc04# possible first bad commit: [05028c83ffea91506baec9829872a8bfa72a4e40] source-hash-59db0cb6752f269893e2697bf561643aec92bdf1# possible first bad commit: [d43a96e8f17f73bd4be6af586132358d2883500f] source-hash-b2d08d759ee755cb5722553e01fb6d007ac9ffbe# possible first bad commit: [51f094cf62f3f4b4f68f9c77f052d896a97e04e6] source-hash-0143805a565418d2a114c16b7eeba3b784176d9eMost probable cause is commit 0143805a565418d2a114c16b7eeba3b784176d9e .right, it is 0143805a565418d2a114c16b7eeba3b784176d9eCreatedpartial revertThis makes it work again. base class ::Activate/::DeActivate calls SfxShell::BroadcastContextForActivation so remove the explicit calls to that from sd and revert back to calling the base one which does that.

id=67665	Createdan errorneous ODG and reference PDFSteps to reproduce:1. get Liberation font set ()2. start Libreoffice in your Windows 7 64bit3. open the ODG attachment4. compare with PDF attachment created from the file5. If the problem was reproduced properly: instead of Liberation fonts (as show in PDF), you will see Times New Roman in the whole text (ODG)6. Change styles to Liberation fonts7. Save the ODG8. Goto 2. Mmh, strange. I can reproduce the behavior when I open your attached ODG. From step 6 I fail to reproduce it. Changing the font back to 'Liberation Sans', save it, reopen it -> correct font.Can you reproduce this problem every time, also from scratch?Kind regards,JorenYou don't have to get any font set- just try setting the default style to anything else - save, close, reopen - styles aren't saved.Thank you for reporting this issue!

What can be done to speed up getting it assigned and getting a patch out there to fix it? It is forcing people to switch to alternative packages to LibreOffice. Some of us upgraded because of awful bugs in previous versions, so going back to older versions is not even really an option. I am asking this out of innocence as a long time supporter of Free Software. I cannot imagine having a bug that stops the application dead in its tracks and then not fixing it. I would sell my soul to the devil for a reasonable fix that is released so ordinary folk can use it.Well, its XMLTextExportPropertySetMapper::ContextFontFilter that kills the export of the font info. The mentioned bibisect commits put all fonts into the FontAutoStylePool and ContextFontFilter gets called multiple times and ends up filtering out all info about the font via that GetFontAutoStylePool()->Find area.Caolan McNamara committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":Resolves: fdo#67665 font names filtered out on odp/odg exportThe patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

id=68315	I have an .odb file which uses ODBC to connect to a postgresql database located on another computer. Inside the .odb file there are several forms defined. Since LO 4.0 whenever I change data in any of these forms and press the "save record" button, I get:Error updating the current recordthe target rows is out of the rowsetSQL-Status: HY107Error code: 20And the next time I press the "save record" button, LO crashes.This bug makes LO 4.0 completely unusable for me since I can do no work on my database. I am stuck with using LO 3.6.x which works fine. The error message seems to originate from the odbc-postgresql package. Since this is identical for my installation of LO 3.6 and LO 4.0 it seems that LO 4.0 sends different information to the ODBC driver than it used to do in version 3.6You have reported this behavior for Linux. Which version do you use? Have a look here for special problem ODBC / MariaDB in openSUSE:I use Ubuntu 12.04. The bug you mention is similar but different. For example, I can view any amount of data in the forms but as soon as I change some I get an error message, and at the second try a crash. Also, my database is PostgreSQL not mySQLI have now setup ODBC for postgresql on OpenSUSE 12.3 64bit. I could open the folder public, could see the tables, but when I try to open the tables LO 4.* crashes immediately. When I try the same with any 3.* version (have tested 3.3.4, 3.6.6.2 and 3.6.7.2) LO hangs and the whole KDE-windowmanager is very slow.The only way to get LO open a table of postgresql with ODBC is to use the packages, which are packed by OpenSUSE itself. With this packages (LO 4.1.0.4) I could see the content of the tables, could try a input, but it fails with an error "7", query ... Â«)Â». So ODBC isn't usable with postgresql on my system at all.The direct connection between postgresql and the OpenSUSE-packages of LO is running without problems.Where do you get the packages from, when LO is working together with ODBC and Postgresql?Server (on a different machine than the LO client):- Ubuntu 12.04 32bit- postgresql-9.1 version 9.1.9-0ubuntu12.04Client:- Ubuntu 12.04 32bit- odbc-postgresql version 1:09.00.0310-2LO 3.6.6 installed manually from the libreoffice web page-> this combination works fine. The only reason I am installing manually from the webpage is because of the report-builder package which is not included in the Ubuntu12.04 version of LO.

Which (if/when they work), are the preferred settings anyway, since they are work-arounds for bugs / incompleteness in the ODBC driver.Changing the settings solved this problem for me.

id=68566	CreatedThe file that is working with 4.0.4 and fails with 4.1.0I have a spreadsheet created with Libreoffice 4.0.4 which includes a master table into which I enter a sort of address book, listing lastname, firstname, position, roles, phone numbers, email and postal addresses.I use an auto filter to be able to sort that table using the column headers.Within the same file I have sheets for a subset of the information of the master table. All is working perfect in 4.0.4 and when I upgraded to the 4.1.0 release the following issues came up and made me downgrade back to the 4.0.4 release:1) If you enter an email address in one cell on the master sheet the email is recognized as URI and reformated as a mailto link. This was no issue in 4.0.4, but in 4.1.0 other sheets refering to this column using a formular like: =T(Master.J22) do no longer get me the text from the master table but generate an empty cell. Seems that if the master contains text only (no URI) the reference is working, if its converted to a URI the reference is broken, and all child sheets show empty cells instead of showing the email address.2) If you use the master table to resort the address list, the information is not always updated on the child sheets. E.g on the master I have roles for some persons. These roles are e.g. chief, leader team 1, leader team2, clerk, etc.In 4.0.4 I was able to sort the table by role to have all assigned roles at the top of the table. The child sheets reflected this and content sorting order matched the master.In 4.1.0 the roles will show according the sorting order as well as in their original position they have been before the master was resorted using a different criteria.Hope this is clear. I attach the sample file used. I made the first two entries on the master sheet URLs again, and they show on the child sheet using 4.0.4 correctly, but are empty on 4.1.0. Using lastname / function sorting again the dependent sheets are working fine on 4.0.4 and fail on 4.1.0. Operating System: Mac OS XVersion: 4.1.0.4 release Please, could explain step by step what to do on your file to reproduce the problem?Your file opens without problem with versions 4.2.0.0.beta2+, 4.1.5.0+ and 4.0.6 under Ubuntu 13.10 x86-64Best regards. JBFWhat I understand:1st presume bug: The T() function returns an empty string instead off the cell text when cell contains an URL.2nd presume bug: When sorting "master sheet", other sheets are not refreshed.Both presume bug are not reproducible with 4.1.3.Update with a most recent vesion and tell us if you still reproduce.Hi,thanks for having a look at my issue. I appreciate this very much.I just downloaded LibreOffice 4.1.3.2 and can confirm that the T(..) function now seems to work, because the mailto: URIs on the master sheet will produce the email address as text on the sheet called "AdressListe". So one issue is remaining.The sheet is used for our voluntary fire-fighter department. For this we hand out the telephone/address list to all members of the fire-fighters.The sheet called "TelefonListe" should be sorted using the column "Fkt-Sort". The goal is to have all people that have a specific role in the fire department at the top of the "TelefonListe" sheet so that their phone numbers are listed first.The lastname column on the master sheet is used to sort the sheet "AddressList" in alphabetical order based on the peoples last name.I can confirm that the sorting bug remains in the 4.1.3.2 version while in 4.0.4 it is working well. This is what you need to do:1) Go on the master sheet and sort by lastname.2) Verify that the members are sorted on the TelefonListe and AdressListe sheets in alphabetical order. Especially in the TelefonListe the functional role of the people should be the same on the master and on the TelefonListe. 3) I now print the AdressListe sheet to have that sheet in alphabetical order.4) Next I use the Fkt-Sort column on the master sheet to sort the list based on the functional role of the fire-fighters.5) Now you go on the TelefonListe sheet to see if the list has been sorted. With 4.1.3.2 the names are sorted correctly, but the column with the functional roles is not. When I use the release 4.0.4 the functional roles are sorted correct and reflect the order on master sheet.Hope this helps you to figure out whats going wrong here.Regards and many thanks,MichaelOne more thing. The behavior looks to me, as if in 4.0.x releases clears table cells on dependent sheets before filling them again. Thats why the functional roles appear correct in that release. In 4.1 releaes this seems to have been optimized such that cell data is overwritten with the new data depending on sorting results. However if an empty cell is put on top of a cell that previously contained data, then the cell content is no longer cleared. Therefore in 4.1.x the sorting appears broken in the dependent sheets for columns that do not contain data in every cell.Does this make sense?The content ofhas been deleted by Tollef Fog Heen <>who provided the following reason:ConfidentialThe token used to delete this attachment was generated at 2014-05-05 15:33:48 UTC.It is impossible to test further without a test file.If you still encounter this bug with current stable version, could you attach an anonymized version of your original file ?

Sigh.*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***Too bad that I need this for my work...I tend to agree to some other guy saying that this basic functionality (not updating references) should not have been introduced in the first place on the otherwise wonderful working calc on the 4.2 branch.But what can I say. The guy that had the desire to get this for me intuitive and natural working thing removed from a stable version came first and won.If I would have a vote: revert that change, and have the new configurable feature introduced with V4.4.Anyway I appreciate that you are having a look at my issues. Thank you all.This is literally like asking for a bug to be reintroduced into LibreOffice....Kohei was nice enough to add an option for users to bring the bug back if they so choose.Anyways - feel free to download a daily 4.4 build or of course wait for releaseFair enough - I do not understand what the original bug was. It can't be that the bug is that one feels that its unexpected that referenced cells worked as in 4.2.6 which was that sorting was updating references. Because that to me is not a bug but was expected behavior ...(In reply to Joel Madero from)I disagree. It is _not always_ a bug. The difficulty is to know when in which case it is a bug and in which case it is a feature. That is the reason why a configuration option was necessary. Please try again my test file in.I asked the ESC to consider the decision to revert this commit for branches 4.2 and 4.3.Best regards. JBFIt will not be backported - there is a new string involved - translation and all that fun stuff. So 4.4 it is.(In reply to Jean-Baptiste Faure from)Hope that reverting commits is possible. Unless we're facing dozens new bug report with similar issue until early 2015 and after 4.2.7 released.Also not reverting the commit . . . removing myself from ccFor the records, 4.2.8 and 4.3.5 will restore the old behavior, for 4.4 the UpdateReferenceOnSort option will default to false/unchecked for compatibility.

So frankly, I'm not sure what is wrong.I took a look at the core file in gdb; it seems to me that the code looks for "embeddeddbList" in dbaccess/uiconfig/ui/generalpagedialog.ui, while it is "only" in dbaccess/uiconfig/ui/generalpagewizard.ui.To resolve any doubt, when you say you cannot reproduce, you are testing by opening an *existing* (non-embedded) .odb file, going to menu edit, submenu database, entry "connection type", right? *Not* the new database wizard.

Open the document2. ....3. ....Current behavior: Shows one page onlyExpected behavior: Show first of eight pages Operating System: Windows 7Version: 4.0.4.2 release Thank you for your bug report, I can reproduce this bug running LibreOffice.Version: 4.1.1.2Build ID: 7e4286b58adc75a14f6d83f53a03b6c11fa2903 on Mac osx 10.8.4. this is a regression from 3.6.7 since 4.0.xAlso an issue on Windows 7 sp1, 64bitVersion: 4.2.0.0.alpha0+Build ID: 2d95a1bfd6e0adff791d9e381f0ec37470312522(2013-08-20)Document consists of a single formatted Table that spans 8 pages (US Letter, with 1/2" margins).In LibreOfficeDev master, document opens with a single table, but only two pages. However, the entire table is present, and can be selected/pasted into a new LODev Writer document. The paste action generates all 8 pages in the new document and the table is fully intact from the original.Document opens correctly formatted in Apache OpenOffice 4.0, and MS Office 2013Confirm the regressionVersion 3.6.7.2 (Build ID: e183d5b)in admin install on Windows 7 sp1 64bit.Document opens correctly with the table spanning 8 viewable pages.If it's not inherited from our friends, then a bibisect might help find this.LODev Version 4.0.0.0.beta1(Build ID: 87906242e87d3ddb2ba9827818f2d1416d80cc7)(2012-12-07)It came in as 8 pages, but the first 3 1/2 pages of table are blank. Table starts to display starting halfway down 4th page, pages 5 - 8 are correct.So there was DOC/DOCX filter work being done during the 3.7 master phase. I'll see if I can find where/when the import filter drops the additional pages between 4.0.0 and 4.0.4.2Always a joy... meanwhile if someone with keys to the bibsects wants to try, they may get there first :)As I try to bibisect this regression, I see two different badbehaviours.The temporally first "bad" behaviour here is different from theoriginal report: Writer is aware that the document has nine pages, butthe first three and a bit pages are blank.

Where do we promise that tinderbox builds would be usable on XP?Markus provides a hint on building in a note to the Dev list.need to build with "--with-windows-sdk=7.1A" flagLooking at the full build logs suggests that is not yet happening for the TB 39 builds of master.(In reply to)Sorry but if the "fix" is as simple as a compiler flag (or a compiler version upgrade), then tracking the issue in BZ certainly is appropriate and in the best interest of the project. This is especially true for the Windows and OS X builds where substantive QA and UX feedback will only occur if the project infrastructure provides functional TB builds for testing.While it is common place for folks on Linux to roll their own--not at all so for the Windows or OS X user community.(In reply to)Nowhere. But it is frequently asked to QA people to start testing Master builds as soon as possible in order to report bugs early in development.Of course if TDF prefers to ignore Windows XP or exclude it from early testing it just needs to say so.@: Pedro; V Stuart Foote I changed the status to "fixed" because the TDF has not defined any member of the Community (for example, LuboÅ¡ or Fridrich) having a computer with the necessary configuration, as one of the builders of the MSI package. I think that we have no right to demand that the volunteers replaced programs on their computers in order to satisfy our interests.Best regards, ape@ape, you neglected to actually set the issue to fixed.But that aside, TB 39 is TDF owned hardware issued/loaned to Kendy for TinderBox build needs. Maintaining it is a volunteer effort as always--which he's done with finesse. Also, a read of the TB Status page and logs () shows today's posted 2013-10-03 7:14 TB 39 build was not built with the "--with-windows-sdk=7.1A" compile flag; but the 2013-10-03 10:51 build was. Meaning that later today or tomorrow at the latest we will know if the issue has been fully resolved with a working build for 32-bit Windows XP.When available we can check out the build and then correctly close this incident.StuartOn Windows XP sp3 32-bit as guest OS in VMWare WorkstationVersion: 4.2.0.0.alpha0+Build ID: 050248fea53adb6a14b649c5f84dd69a8faff997TinderBox: Win-x86@39, Branch:master, Time: 2013-10-04_08:16:05This TB 39 build of master installs and runs without issue.Setting Resolved Fixed.LibO-Dev_4.2.0.0.alpha0+ (ID: 050248fea53adb6a14b649c5f84dd69a8faff997, TinderBox: Win-x86@39, Time: 2013-10-04_08:16:05) started on Windows XP 64-bit sp2 (last update).
id=70355	CreatedExample of bug described.See attached document.Open the document in LibreOffice 3.6 to see the graphs as they should be. Open the document in versions 4.0, 4.1, or 4.2 and the x/y axis of the data tables will be reversed causing the graphs to show incorrect data.For example, if you were looking at it as if it were a spreadsheet, everything from Row 1 is put into Column A, everything from Row 2 is put into Column B, and so on. After further testing, exporting the document to pdf or saving as a doc also seems to distort the graphs (even in 3.6).Is it possible to show a screenshot showing the difference between both LibreOffice versions?I can't see anything wrong using Mac OSX 10.8.5 with LibreOffice Version: 4.1.2.3Build ID: 40b2d7fde7e8d2d7bc5a449dc65df4d08a7dd38All charts/graphs looks correct (and logical) to me.Kind regards,JorenCreatedScreenshot of data table from 3rd bar graph in document (Bad, version 4.0-4.2)Screenshot of data table from 3rd bar graph in document (Bad, version 4.0-4.2)CreatedScreenshot of data table from 3rd bar graph in document (Good, version 3.6)Screenshot of data table from 3rd bar graph in document (Good, version 3.6)Screenshots of an example data table added.

Looks to me definitely MAB4.0, not sure about the priority.Kind regards,JorenCreatedScreenshot in Version 4.0.6.1This is what I see inWin7x64 UltimateVersion 4.0.6.1 (Build ID: 7168152d13aa529ba3718c9ae3700216a574137)I am not in an error is the same as in 3.6Hm since it's been around since 4.0.0.3 and we've had releases since then, IMHO not a blocker but I'm happy with it being a critical bug since it's affecting a very common feature + it's a regression. Markus - let us know if you want a bibisectAn interesting issue - of course a bisect is always useful for a regression; Muthu has done most work in the chart world in recent times though Markus is now doing a chunk of work there ...There is no change on top of my mind that could bring this regression.Yes, a bisect would be really helpful.There is one change in the embedded object handling coming from the AOO rebase that is most likely related.Sadly we can't revert this patch but it changes the initialization order of chart objects which makes some of the import hacks in the chart uno implementation fail. I have looked into it before and fixed one that was similar for calc but there are surely more issues related to this change out there.From `git bisect`: 305763174e4eed88f03bba7df1276cdf26be9a0c is the first bad commit ... commit bb5196b40cc5f8f2d4f221e61a20d572ce504558 ...and from `git bisect log`: # bad: [d31848bf3b700a22d127d7c775a0f910a7e133d0] source-hash-86cbe18a6143bf054c31f69dc97368dfdd3ad374 # good: [3e7462bd65e692bf0592d5b080b7716341b62a47] source-hash-1eddfce9894fd05315173744f495619189093dc7 git bisect start 'latest' 'oldest' # good: [578fb08152ad11454e2f09ad6f8c8e527da817de] source-hash-4e3e171262aed0e52fa76158950d5be770249e80 git bisect good 578fb08152ad11454e2f09ad6f8c8e527da817de # bad: [efb04c1c794ef7fc4cda1eb80880d333ca969a5e] source-hash-7908692490120350f2ad45241f7b19ba52dc0489 git bisect bad efb04c1c794ef7fc4cda1eb80880d333ca969a5e # good: [b46b5a58fcaec85eefb31b23afb0fc389a0c5334] source-hash-34c1b7bdd0bca4753f66a7d17ef46647a64a319e git bisect good b46b5a58fcaec85eefb31b23afb0fc389a0c5334 # good: [3791268ce3e6f9e570f02c09d586fd8e9f2485c3] source-hash-51daa4de4fbb86903aeb9cdfefbb089e8d00c001 git bisect good 3791268ce3e6f9e570f02c09d586fd8e9f2485c3 # bad: [8f14f077f5faef9b7660ddf5ebcd188eb3042372] source-hash-dd5c0b2db451ff4d6fac7a72770758513583d468 git bisect bad 8f14f077f5faef9b7660ddf5ebcd188eb3042372 # good: [f066d428aeb365ac57d1863b9a574d82cddec974] source-hash-c99b97d306211fe346a7d0a5208aa99118208fc5 git bisect good f066d428aeb365ac57d1863b9a574d82cddec974 # bad: [a2f22aae2d4c64e7426980214bc9e63237223647] source-hash-83f77ab0661df992f241e5f9ecb1aa8f8eaeafec git bisect bad a2f22aae2d4c64e7426980214bc9e63237223647 # bad: [305763174e4eed88f03bba7df1276cdf26be9a0c] source-hash-bb5196b40cc5f8f2d4f221e61a20d572ce504558 git bisect bad 305763174e4eed88f03bba7df1276cdf26be9a0c # good: [08a8f062763014582190ae8742fabc657cfa9078] source-hash-e67c21ee0696cde7538016a813a5cbf39fb803b0 git bisect good 08a8f062763014582190ae8742fabc657cfa9078Thanks Terrence :)!Range:(In reply to)This one? :Looks indeed very related (title = transpose, what actually happened here).Dangit :)Kind regards,JorenCommit 14fa5488a829936275f79a7693b13da55114220e was reverted by Markus in 2013-11-02 19 -->Not reproducible in 4.1.4 nor 4.2.0Should we close it?Since the commit that was reverted was identified - going to mark as FIXED.Migrating Whiteboard tags to Keywords: (bibisected)[NinjaEdit]

id=68906	Problem description: I have done a clean reinstall of OSX 10.8.4 and noticed some problems since the time.I have a PPTX presentations (3 slides) which I try to open, then I try to add new slide and the Libre Office is gone.The most important thing here is: the presentations contains 3 slides, a title slide and 2 normal slides. I can add another title slide (with I right-click between slide number 1 (title) and 2). But it crashes while clicking between 2nd and 3rd slide on at the end.I tried to reinstall it - no luck. I tried the same file on my second MacBook (with the same OSX) and it works pretty well.The same occurs while pasting the whole page ofand scrolling it down. Well it sometimes occurs unexptected quits or just paste 3-4 pages instead of everything.I would like to share the PPTX file however it's company related so I would like to send it to someone, just not to publish it on the Internet.

/ 6Operating System: Mac OS XVersion: 4.1.1.2 rc Side note. I removed my local prefs from $HOME/Library/Application Support/LibreOffice. Crashes still occurs.I found the same presentation just extended to about 100 slides and saved in ODS format. No crashes so far.About pasting the article from WikiTravel.First, the day I did a clean install of OSX I could paste it fully then it has been crashing while scrolling.I came back to the issue today and reinstalled LibreOffice. Now when I try to paste a wholel article I get only 3 pages (it should about about 17 pages) and then while scrolling crashes or freezes.I don't think it would be easy to reproduce on other instances. However, I can fully help with debuging it on my machine if anyone is interested?Still working on the issue.This is what I figured out.1. The PPTX file works without any problems on OpenOffice. Only LibreOffice issue related.2. The problem with pasting only 3 pages of 20 or so from WikiTravel is Firefox issue related. The same happens with OpenOffice, apart from it doesn't crash. Interesting thing is that pasting the article from Firefox to TextEdit or vim works fine. 3. There is no crashes now when article is copied from Safari. Then the whole article is pasted and no issues.So, there is still the issue with PPTX. I would like to share the file to any developers if needed.Thanks.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Backtrace attached, so marking as NEW. Alsocontains a similar crash.(In reply to)Hi Bartosz Skowron,Would be great if you could attach your PPTX file. You can replace all the confidential information with some junk. Thanks.Also please test with the latest 4.1.2 release, and report the results. I think that your problem is related to, which has been fixed in 4.1.2. Thanks.I have upgraded to 4.1.2.3 and the problems are gone. However there is a new issue related to.A new problem exists while pasting a whole page.Then press cmd+q (quit) and the document is gone but you can't fully quit the LibreOffice. There is still icon in Dock and menubar, more - you can open or create new documents but you CAN'T quit LibreOffice (only by using Force Quit).Also, try to select all text fromand paste to LibreOffice then it freezes while saving.(In reply to)Great! So I'll close this bug.Let's not mix two completely unrelated bugs. Would be great if you could open a new bug report for this problem and post the link to it here, so we could continue that discussion over there.Opened here #70758
id=70941	This is the LibreOffice most annoying bugs meta tracker. For a description and details about most annoying bugs please visit. Bugs should only be added to this list by QA or Developers or by users if requested by a Quality Assurance (QA) member or a developer. If you feel like a bug you have submitted qualifies, please review the wiki listed above, and if the bug is particularly nasty (crasher, severe loss of data, etc...) please email the QA mailing list with the bug number and a short description of the bug so that the QA team can determine if the bug should be added to this list.For any questions, concerns or suggestions please email the QA mailing list: no french version of this bug report . I cannot say it in english thus i go forward in french, sorry :Dans libre office calc, Ã  un certain moment, lors de la sÃ©lection d'une cellule, le programme se bloque et fait continuellement des sauvegardes du fichier.Ce fichier est irrÃ©cupÃ©rable par la suite !Added (hopefully correctly) as instructed by @michael_meeksMight not crash anything nor lose data as such, but gives appearance of lost data and indicates (a) file compatibility issue and (b) potential ODF compliance issue; both are serious from a user/adoption perspective.Bug 23631 doesn't belong here.@Joel: this is single LibreOffice MAB beyond 4.2 version, right?Unfortunately that hasn't been completely vetted yet so I don't think we're doing that quite yet - when we do, we should do ALL bugs at the same time but we need to figure out procedures a bit to ensure that bugs get tested appropriately and frequently enough.Joel, what's up with this? I do not get the purpose of this empty MAB bug.Created oct 2013 lastmonths ago. A single bug I see which I just tested and WORKSFORME.So setting this to INVALID. If this bug will be put to major use, why not create it again, when it's really needed.Currently it's just empty and cluttering the bug tracker without helping anybody.

It seemed a question of time working with the spreadsheet. But it is possible to reproduce using repeatedly F2 and [Enter], more visible if there is a formula in the cell. Doesn't happen pasting in a cell.I was not able find so far as to reproduce the problem.Reproducible:Wint7x64UltimateVersion 4.0.6.2 (Build ID: 2e2573268451a50806fcd60ae2d9fe01dd0ce24)Version: 4.1.4.0.0+ Build ID: d6ee64b75581cbeb92534271ee6f4e87f07aa5cVersion: 4.2.0.0.alpha0+ Build ID: df21d317dacc4533ac999f3c3088765393842676 TinderBox: Win-x86@42, Branch:master, Time: 2013-11-05_00:13:53Added to Mab 4.0You can reproduce this problem on the Mac too. And in a way that you can clearly see the impact this bug has on end users.Steps to reproduce (basically the same as the opening report):1. Launch LibreOffice and get into Calc2. Launch the VoiceOver screen reader with Cmd+F53. Press F2 followed by Escape4. Repeat step 3Each time you press F2, VoiceOver will say "edit text" and when you press Escape it will include the cell name (e.g. "Cell A1 edit text"). As you continue repeating step 3:The first thing you'll notice is an increasing delay in the amount of time it takes for VoiceOver to announce that you are back in the cell (the "Cell A1 edit text" message).After a few more repetitions, before you get the message that you are back in the cell, VoiceOver announces "LibreOffice busy". As you continue repeating step 3, there is an increasing delay between the time you hear "LibreOffice busy" to the time you are told you are back in the cell.confirmed in Linux kernel 2.6.32-358.23.2.el6.x86_64 with Gnome v2.

to fix this we should first reproduce the problem; second put a couple of breakpoints into:addAccessibleEventListener and removeAccessibleEventListenerget a full (with symbols) backtrace from each of these.Clearly one of those code-paths is not going on to call removeAccessibleEventListener - hence the problem =)It'd be great to have help to fix this for the impaired.Thanks !CreatedBacktrace - addAccessibleEventListener (AtkListener)I'll add the backtraces one for each breakpoint mentioned in.CreatedBacktrace - addAccessibleEventListener (DocumentFocusListener)CreatedBacktrace - removeAccessibleEventListener (DocumentFocusListener)The AtkListener:is leaked through this trace as you see;

id=72394	LibreOffice 4.2 Beta 2 for MacOS X 10.9 freezes when saving any change in the Preferences (Options) windows. The problem happens with 32 and 64 bit versions, and you have to kill the program using Force Quit. Tested on two different MacBook, with different processors.To reproduce, launch LibreOffice, open a document (even a new one), open the Preference window, change one of the options in one of the panels (I tried with several combinations), hit Save to apply the change. The cursor does not change shape for a few seconds, then changes to the multi-colour wheel and stays as such forever (until you force quit the program). Hi Italo,thanks for reporting the problem. No problem on Ubuntu.Might be Mac-specific?Cheers,CorMmh, can't reproduce this one. Tested using Mac OSX 10.9 with a mid 2010 Macbook Pro 13".@Foss: any chance to reproduce this one :)?After a clean install of LO 4.2 Beta 2, I managed to find the culprit, and was able to reproduce the problem on Windows too. The freeze happens when you change a path in the Path section of the Options (Preferences in MacOS). I tried to change the Template path, and when I pushed OK the program froze.

id=72949	CreatedExample spreadsheetThe attached sheet works in 4.1.4.2 and previous, but produces incorrect dsums in 4.2.0.1.The Interest sheet sums the balances within each interest range, in the criteria to the right, from the AC Cashflow sheet. The total should be 120.The criteria select a range of rates to sum. (eg > 0.005 and <= 0.0055).In 4.2.0.1, the result sometimes seems to depend on whether the Interest sheet is before or after the AC Cashflow sheet. Move the sheet, and you may get a different answer. When the sum is wrong, it is as if the lower bound has been ignored. The Interest sheet then sums balances up to a specific rate, rather than between the 2 rates in the criteria, and gives a total much larger than 120.It took me a long time to find this since I have a very involved set of financial sheets that produced different results for reasons that were very obscure. I narrowed it down to this dsum.

id=72953	I have a complex set of many tens of sheets, with many containing graphs of data in other sheets. In 4.0.2.1 all the graph legends are empty. They are OK in 4.1.4.2.I have tried to replicate the problem with a simple pair of sheets, one with a simple graph of the data in the other, but am so far unable to do so. I will keep trying and attach one later if I can.I cannot attach the file that shows the problem, or even send it by pm, because it contains highly personal financial data. I may be able to cut it down to just one non-sensitive example. CreatedSpreadsheet demonstrating the problemThe attached has 2 sheets - a graph and some data. In 4.2.0.1 the legend is blank. In 4.1.4.2 and previous is it not.This was created by deleting all non-relevant parts of a rather complex set of sheets. I'm hoping none of that data remains - I have looked. There are some empty macro modules (one per sheet) but that seems to be all. I'd be grateful if someone could inform me if I have left something other than the 2 sheets.Hey Tim -You are correct - and this looks quite nasty.

That problem is tracked at- resolving this one as duplicate.*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***OK - thanks. I can see that if I change the transparency the legend appears.When I tried creating a simple graph from scratch in 4.1.4.2 I couldn't reproduce the problem. I can't say I have ever set the background deliberately, but most of my graphs originally come from an Excel 2003 workbook, and that may be the source of the background colour.I'll wait for #72005 (and others) to get fixed before migrating to 4.2.Migrating Whiteboard tags to Keywords: ()Remove redundant 'ConfirmedRegression'[NinjaEdit]

If data is called from another sheet , it fails.Using Libreoffice 4.2.1.1 on Windows XP SP3.I uploaded a sample file in my previous post just now.Please test yourself.Kind Regards,Burak UralIt's better to file a new bug for a new test case. Reopening should be done only when the original test case fails. But I'll leave the decision up to Eike.Hi Burak,search vector must be sorted,(),and your are looking in the wrong column, data for search vector are in Sheet2.B not in Sheet2.Awith data sorted by Sheet2.B, your formula should be:G3: =LOOKUP(F3;Sheet2.$B$3:$B$16;Sheet2.$A$3:$A$16)For me not a bug. If you are not agree, please as Kohei has suggested file a new bug.IMO, Eike can reset the status to Resolved Fixed.I am sorry , I made some error during creating a sample file.I did test and confirm :1- Even unsorted it is working.2- It is working if the data is in different sheet.3- It is NOT working if the search area is bigger actual area filled with data.For example:1 a z2 b x3 c y4 d v5 e tIf I use formula =lookup(a1;b1:b100;c1;c100) - imagining I will enter more data in future - so I set search area much longer b100 instead of b5 , the result becomes N/A.Other spreadsheet software does not get affected of empty cells.Would you please classify this as a bug and fix it?Sorry for the previous confusion but I just found out why exactly my calculations were not working.Kind Regards,Burak Urala1;b1:b100;c1;c100 = > a1;b1:b100;c1:c100Typing mistake ; instead of :Just in case if you think I used a wrong formula.The bug exists if the search area is bigger than actual data area.(In reply to)That's an entirely different issue. I'll close this bug once again.Try again oncefinds its way into the stable branch. You are still welcome to file a new bug with your test case too then we can verify if that's really a duplicate of.After doing some more tests, I can confirm this problem I have , is definitely specific to the file I work with.Please there are other formulas with empty cells and they are working fine.Whatever the reason do not think anymore it is not about formulas.In my document there are 406 lines with data.I have added more data and after 500 lines , the formula began to work.I could not produce the same situation with entering data to a new sheet and creating same number of data using a lookup function that has more search area defined.Sorry for taking your time.It is likely that your problem is an incarnation of one of the other VLOOKUP bugs fixed for 4.2.2/4.2.3.Setting this one RESOLVED again.Unfortunately that is not so.I mean it has nothing to do with Vlookup bug fixed.This is something like for example the page preview disapperance bug.Sometimes, while working on Calc, I place a picture into the document.I click print preview and all I get is an empty page.I copy whole sheet into another sheet and it gets normal.There is something wrong within the depths of openoffice/libreoffice code that fails sometimes for some reason...In this case, I have a long xls with 5 sheets and some formulas.The last sheet has the calculation formula from other sheets and while other sheets has 400 and 700 lines, the formula covers 1000 lines of other sheets.Interestingly in Libreoffice 4.1.2.2 , the lookup formula referencing 2nd sheet works fine. Lookup formula referencing first sheet was giving N/A until I filled up to 500 lines with data and deleted the data returning to previous stage, however the lookup code worked fine after this.Yesterday, I downloaded 4.2.3.1 release current on the main download page.I wanted to test the original xls to see how the lookup code would react.Interestingly this time even the previous working lookup referencing 2nd sheet did not work.I again entered junk data up to 1000 lines and removed and it worked fine.However this only happens with my xls sheet. I can not produce it with a small self made sheet. So something out there , I have no idea.Regards,Burak UralPleae Burak, could you hear what developers said and have a bit of confidence in them.Looking in the bugas in theKohei have informed,In that bug the last patch is 2014-03-13 15:43:04 UTC 4.2.3.1 was compiled (Windows) 13-Mar-2014 21:15so it's not possible the patch is in 4.2.3.1I have verified it is fixed in daily releases:Version: 4.2.4.0.0+ Build ID: b5b9da46ceae23b25e963087d00b0ae5b4785c93 TinderBox: Win-x86@42, Branch:libreoffice-4-2, Time: 2014-03-13_23:32:39Version: 4.3.0.0.alpha0+ Build ID: 12ae7672f285da1d4c730315e8db23b3396b71cc TinderBox: Win-x86@39, Branch:master, Time: 2014-03-14_00:18:00Please have a bit of patience (the patience is the mother of the science) and stop adding new comments in this report, it doesn't help in any way.Migrating Whiteboard tags to Keywords: (bibisected)Remove redundant 'ConfirmedRegression'[NinjaEdit]

In this instance I am editing a cell function "=ROUND(D41*0.2,2)". When I do I get the message "LibreOffice requires a Java runtime environment (JRE) to perform this task The selective JRE is defective. Please select another version or install a new JRE and select it under Tools - Options - LibreOffice - Advanced.". I do this and the situation still occurs.I used to have this problem occasionally with earlier versions of LibreOffice and a switch of JRE in the "Tools - Options - LibreOffice - Advanced" tab would fix it. Nothing seems to fix it now and it just crashes and crashes. I have had to install Open office just to get work done. I have used LibreOffice for a number of years and like it. It would be great to resolve this and get back to it.Any suggestions please? Hi Maurice, thanks for reporting.I think LibreOffice doesn't need java with functions.In any case verify you are using a 32 bits java, 64 bits doesn't work.Try resetting the user profile, sometimes solves strange issues.Have you added some extension?Link about change user profile.Maurice reports by E-mail that he has removed his profile, and the problems persist.Maurice - can you confirm that you have no extensions installed ? This is not the 1st instance of problems in calc around formula editing and Java - I suspect that we attempt to use the scripting framework to check if there are any scripts present in each language (or something similarly silly), and this blows up with Java. what does "Tools->Extension Manager" show ? (another screenshot would be awesome).Maurice - can you report whether Calc continues to work if you hit 'ok' ? I appreciate it throws up a scary looking dialog but ... it shoudl continue to work.It sounds like we've got some problem here rather than all of the installed JRE's being defective of course :-)What would be really helpful would be to get a better exception message out of that beastie I guess.Stephan - any thoughts ? marking a MAB anyway.void SAL_CALL JavaInteractionHandler::handle( const Reference< XInteractionRequest >& Request ) throw (RuntimeException)is where the error comes from: com::sun::star::java::JavaVMCreationFailureException e4;... else if ( anyExc >>= e4 ) { if( !(m_bShowErrorsOnce && m_bVMCreationFailure_Handled)) { // Java not correctly installed, or damaged SolarMutexGuard aSolarGuard; m_bVMCreationFailure_Handled = true;#ifdef MACOSX ErrorBox aErrorBox( NULL, SvtResId( ERRORBOX_JVMCREATIONFAILED_MAC ) );#else ErrorBox aErrorBox( NULL, SvtResId( ERRORBOX_JVMCREATIONFAILED ) );#endif aErrorBox.SetText(SvtResId( STR_ERROR_JVMCREATIONFAILED ).toString()); nResult = aErrorBox.Execute(); } elseI guess we could try to provide / tunnel through more useful data here from the exception ? then again there is no useful information in the exception as it is thrown either.stoc/source/javavm/javavm.cxx: css::java::JavaVMCreationFailureException exc( OUString("JavaVirtualMachine::getJavaVM failed because Java is defective!"), static_cast< cppu::OWeakObject * >(this), 0); askForRetry(css::uno::makeAny(exc));I guess (?).Thanks !Createdattachment-7005-0.htmlMichaelThis will obviously sounds completely stupid but what extension are youtalking about.The screenshots pdf attached ("131231 Bug report 73168 screenshots") showsa number of extensions which I have not myself consciously installed.Going bacck to my crashing spreadsheet, When I had pressed OK to the "JREis Defective" message it did not crash immediatelybut as soon as I tried to put in an "=" formula, up popped the message.

Maybe the problem disappears if you disable or remove that extension.* The "The selected JRE is defective" error box ultimately must be caused by one of the four uses of JFW_PLUGIN_E_VM_CREATION_FAILED in jvmfwk/plugins/sunmajor/pluginlib/sunjavaplugin.cxx (i.e., either unable to load the JVM lib, no JNI_CreateJavaVM exported from that lib, or an error when calling that JNI_CreateJavaVM). On Windows, this is most likely caused by the JVM lib depending on other libs (like a C++ runtime lib) that cannot be found; maybe do_msvcr71_magic (jvmfwk/plugins/sunmajor/pluginlib/sunjavaplugin.cxx) does not work as intended for some reason.I don't think I installed the CalcStockAddIn.oxt extension but I have nowdisabled it.

id=74009	Problem description: When a spreadsheet cell has long text value (text over-flowing outside cell width), the over-flowed part was not printed, both for print preview and actual printing.Reproduced in Ubuntu 13.10 x86 and Windows 8 X86. This is a regression against 4.1.4.2.Steps to reproduce:1. Start Calc, input "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" in A1 (some of the chars are outside the cell width)2. Print preview, you only see "abcdefghijklmn"3. Print the file, you only got "abcdefghijklmn" on the paper.Expected behavior:You got "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", both in print preview mode and actual printing.I believe this should be a blocker of 4.2.0 release. Operating System: AllVersion: 4.2.0.3 rcLast worked in: 4.1.4.2 release Bug confirmed under Windows XP Pro x86 SP3.It is indeed a regression from branch 4.1. And a bad one...Confirmed using Version: 4.2.0.3Build ID: c63c03decdf780d8fb80823950665b782ec9ecd0 Ubuntu 13.10I don't think it's a bloker but should be on the MAB, so I reduce to critical and set Highest for the new MAB policy.For me this behavior is not a bug:1/ spreadsheet is not a word processor2/ it is the responsibility of the user to manage the visibility of its data3/ if you write in the next cell on the right, the part of the text that overflow outside the cell becomes not visible, exactly as in the preview. It is true even if you put a blank character in the adjoining cell.4/ you can manage the text formatting so that long text is automatically wrapped in the cell.5/ use cell fusion when it is useful.That said, what seems buggy is the following:1/ type a long text in the cell A1 so that it overflow outside the cell2/ menu File > Page Preview ==> only the part of the text which is inside the cell width is visible3/ type a long text in cell A2 so that it overflow outside the cell4/ menu File > Page Preview ==> same behavior as in 2/5/ now, merge the cells in A1 so that the merged cell A1 contains the entire text6/ menu File > Page Preview ==> all the text in A2 is now visible.So it seems that the cell width in column A used in the preview (idem in pdf export) is the width of A1, not the real width of the cell. I think it is not the intended behavior that the apparent width of a cell depends on the width of another cell.Best regards. JBFI guess this bug may be caused by the patch of. (Sorry I just guess, I am not a developer nor IT professional.No longer reproducible using the latest from libreoffice-4-2 branch as of today.It was reproducible as of mid last week. So, I guess some of the fixes that went in must have fixed it.Someone please verify this.It didn't make it into the 4.2.0 branch. So I guess this will be fixed in 4.2.1.I'll mark this as resolved for 4.2.1. Still reproducible using the libreoffice-4-2-0 branch, but it's gone in the libreoffice-4-2 branch. No idea which change has fixed it, so I'll use WORKSFORME.

No crash for me but LO freezes with what seems an infinite loop. There is something strange in the test file: 1/ it has 2 lines in the first column and nothing in column 2 and 32/ the section is formatted with the option "Evenly distribute contents to all columns"These 2 facts are incompatible: with 2/ we should have one line in column 1 and one line in column 2.If I go to Format > Section > Options > Tab Column and uncheck the option, then I do not reproduce the freeze anymore. If I insert some text, go back to the column tab and recheck this option, it still works as expected.Last thing, I can't reproduce the problem from an empty file:a/ insert a section with 3 columnsb/ type some text in column 1whatever is the option chosen for the text distribution in the columns.Hope this helps.

However Libreoffice and its components do not open. No error messages appear.Steps to reproduce:1. .... Install on Windoqs XP2. .... Successful installation3. .... Attempt to run Libreoffice Current behavior: Libreoffice does not open. No error messages appear.Expected behavior: Libreoffice opens Operating System: Windows XPVersion: 4.1.5.1 rc Windows XP Service Pack 3 installedMy system has Java installed (Version 7 Update 51)Did you download LO from?Did you install any LO specific extensions?Could you rename your LO directory profile and give it a new try? (see)About Java, do you use a 32 bits Java version?LO was downloaded fromMy system is 32bit as I assume is JavaNo LO specific extensions were installed. Regarding the LO profile instructions - I have removed the 4.1 and higher versions and am currently using 4.0.6.2 which is working fine.I take it you want me to remove 4.0. Then install 4.2. if it does not open then rename the LO profile to something random and then try using the program - am I correct?I have checked the current LO profile and it shows two directories one named " 3 " and the other " 4 ".(In reply to)Ok so no problem then. (LO is 32 bits only on Windows for the moment, that's why I had asked)OkYes. At the next launch of LO, since it won't find its directory profile, it'll create a brand new one automatically.Yes, it's because you had once LO 3.X.X version. If you don't have any customization or something you can drop the " 3" one.Update - I uninstalled 4.0. I installed 4.2.Install was successful - no error messagesLO would not open - no error messages.I removed all folders in the LO profile directory in application data.I rebooted.I tried safe mode - LO opened.I restarted and entered XP normally. LO does not open. I checked the LO profile directory - there are no directories such as " 3 " and " 4 " as I previously described above.Weird indeed, if you tried 4.2.1 (which fixed a similar problem on 4.2.0)Did you install any specific fonts? If yes, could you uninstall them/put them aside for the test and give it a new try?Does it fail for all the LO apps or just for some of them (Calc, Writer, Impress, ...)?Do you have ApacheOpenOffice installed too? (or had you ever installed it?)Anyway, could you try the raw method?- uninstall any LO/Apache OpenOffice- remove LO directory profile (even if you already did it)- remove any LO/Apache OpenOffice remnant directories in program files- clean your Windows registry with a free tool (eg: ccleaner)- install againIf you still reproduce the problem, you might try to retrieve some interesting information by following this link:Did you install any specific fonts?

I have looked at the LO program directory - I have noticed that there is no "soffice.exe" visible.I am now doing another uninstall and will check for any remnant directories."Weird indeed, if you tried 4.2.1 (which fixed a similar problem on 4.2.0)"You never answered that. You said you installed 4.2. Which exact version did you try?(In reply to)Installed 4.2.1OK - I have removed 4.2.1, run Wise registry and Drive cleaner. Checked for any remnant directories - none found.I am now installing 4.2.1 again - This time I am loading it to my G Drive rather than my C Drive.Will update you shortly.Many thanks KarlAt last - I now have 4.2.1 working Thank you for your assistance. I remain baffled as to what the problem was. Looking at my G Drive there are a lot more directories and files than appeared on the C Drive installation. I am now confused as to why several installations on my C Drive were not including critical files and directories - repeatedly.Any how I am now happy and can use the latest LO - Hurrah.Thanks again.Thank you for your feedback Karl, I put it RESOLVED/WFM.
id=75130	Certain Cell borders made with Calc (4.2.1.1 RC1) are lost when saved to XLS and reopened with CalcI feel that most of the issues are export related as import of borders from a XLS file made using Excel is almost perfect now.The following export works fineSingle Line Borders 0.75 -> Translates to normal Excel BorderSingle Line Borders 1.75 -> Translates to thick Excel BorderSingle Line Borders 2.50 -> Translates to thickest Excel BorderDots 0.75 -> Translates to Excel DotsLong Dash 1.75 -> Translates to Thick Excel DashAll Double Lines -> Translates to Excel Double LineThe export issues are:Single Line Borders 0.05 -> not saved (should be saved as hairline)Dots 0.05 -> not saved (should be saved as 0.75 dots)Dots 1.75 -> saved as Border 1.75 (should be saved as 0.75 dots...?)Dots 2.50 -> saved as Border 2.50 (should be saved as 0.75 dots...?)Dash 0.05 and 0.75 -> not saved (should be saved as 0.75 dash)Dash 1.75 -> saved as Border 1.75 (should be saved as 0.75 dash...?)Dash 2.50 -> saved as Border 2.50 (should be saved as 0.75 dash...?)Long Dash 0.05 -> not savedLong Dash 0.75 -> saved as Single Line Border 0.05Long Dash 2.50 -> saved as Single Line Border 2.50 Unlike Cacl, excel has no option to change the border thickness. The thickness is assigned with the style. So we cannot expect all Borders in calc to be saved as xls. I think some issues can be avoided if the default line thickness in calc is made as 0.75 to match that of Excel. Repro in 4.2.1.1, ubuntu 13.10 x86. Is a regression against 4.2.0 release.Set as Highest Critial.This issue not only happen when export to .xls, but also .xlsx.Createddocument before saveCreateddocument on saveCreateddocument after reopeningAny New Border added on cells getting lost on saving as xls file. Version with problem is 4.2.1 rc1. Used OS windows XP sp3Existing border preserves saved using old versions & copy-paste also preserves on save. But If add a new border, on save it lost & reopen shows no border.guess it's most likely due to big border re-write (commit 9a19e8d838753128504274e1885eb3ce8ec1dbb8)In my testing, only the hairline is lost on save, while the rest look okay.CreatedTest document that contains ALL Excel line types.Test document that contains ALL Excel line types.I'll focus on just preserving the Excel line types during opening and re-saving. The rest are different issues that should be handled in different bugs (due to the larger scope of the whole border line issues).And the dashed line becomes hairline on resave. Those 2 are the only issues I see.Kohei Yoshida committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#75130: Move these tests to the export test and test their export.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

We cannot expect calc to import it as such since the two formats are not supported in Calc. However instead of single line 0.75 thick, it could have been imported as dashes.I don't know if I should be asking this, but can border styles/thickness not supported by Excel be made to hide from the border menu when the file save type is XLS or if the file opened is XLS(In reply to)Please don't do this here. Focus on the bug reported.(In reply to)Don't mix multiple issues please. As I said inwhich I repeat here"I'll focus on just preserving the Excel line types during opening and re-saving. The rest are different issues that should be handled in different bugs (due to the larger scope of the whole border line issues)."Other issues such as missing border types MUST be handled separately from this bug. Thanks for your corporation.And just be upfront, those line types that we don't currently support will NOT be retained when re-saving to Excel. They will become solid lines for now.

Simple test document attached.Adding- resize image (picture) together with frame does not workIt is an often discussed issue in trainings with end users (they do not understand the behaviour), and inserting, captering and resizing a picture is an often done activity by them.Since EoL is near, will MABs stay or not? That was useful, but seems like not the most efficient tool. There was an idea to have only Importance, but personally, I would like to see raised priority for bugs marked as regression, bisected, have-backtrace.Yes we are trying to abandon MAB and replace with severity/importance. These fields will soon be locked out for users and only be available to contributors - this is to ensure consistency and objectivity in deciding the severity/importance. We are hoping to do a test run of this in the next month or so. We have no plans on making a MAB 5 (although this may change).Insert Image how headersIf an image is inserted into the header by the command: Ctrl + Shift + O> Format page-> Encabezamiento-> Activate (Mas) -> Como (picture), it does well, but to save and close the file this image disappears, no matter the format in which it is stored, always disappears. (Sorry for my English is not my language)undo damage from last edit- Long image inserted at the end of page goes beyond margin and over footerThis bug effects NOT ONLY "long" images, but _all images_ embedded in paragraphs near the end of a page."Overlapping" images (over footers and/or below pagemargins) make LO completly useless if you plan to put some images in paragraphs.

id=75694	Createdexample odt that fails to save as docxProblem description: Content of comments deleted when saving to docx (data loss!). I believe this only happens when the first comment spans a block of text (i.e. select a word and hit alt-ctl-c) rather than a point comment (without a selected word); but it is hard to pin down.Steps to reproduce:1. Open LO and begin a new text document.2. Type "one two three four".3. Select the word "two", and hit "alt-ctl-c"; type "blah" into the comment box.4. Save as .odt, and quit.5. Open the .odt; save out as .docx, and quit.6. Open the .docx. The comment is blank, and "blah" does not appear in the source.If instead of selecting a word in (3), the cursor is placed somewhere, the comment saves properly.Attached is an example odt.Confirmed that this persists in 4.2.1.1 Operating System: DebianVersion: 4.1.5.3 release take a look at- Last comment text is lost if you save as .docx without shifting the focus to another text areaare you describing the same issue or a different one?(In reply to)A different issue. This bug appears whether or not I move the cursor after creating the comment.Other notes:1. it is necessary to close the document, and re-open it before saving out as docx. if I create a document, save as .odt, and save as .docx; or just save directly as .docx, this does not occur.2. if I do exactly the same steps, but first save as .docx, then close, and re-open and save as .odt, there is no problem. I am attaching examples: docx-then-odt.{odt,docx} : WORKS odt-then-docx.{odt,docx} : BROKEN3. this is serious: I first noticed this because of a document from someone else in which, when I saved as .docx to send back to them, all their comments would become blank. (major data loss) this is the minimal reproducible example.4. this affects .odt: in my testing, I have occasionally seen examples where the file saved *as .odt* has lost the contents of the comments, or the author of some comments. I haven't been able to make a reproducible example, though.Createdsaved first as odt (broken)Createdsaved first as odt (broken): subsequent save as docxCreatedsaved first as docx (works): docxCreatedsaved first as docx (works), subsequent save as odtUbuntu 13.10LibreOffice 4.2.2.1 rcPlease reset your user profile - I can confirm on the file you provided but cannot confirm on a new document.

id=75946	CreatedDOCX Document created by Libre office and containing more pages of text. After opening this document in libre Office 4.1.5.3 it displays only 2 pages from more previously createdIn teh stable version under Debian Jessie I have crated a document with docx extension. After I edit the document and save it, it contains the text I have entered (In the file included in the document word/document.xml I can see the changes), but if I open the whole document in Libre office, then only short part of the text (2 pages of 4 or 5 originally saved) is displayed to me. ... the document has been created and is opened in the same libre office version/installation. I just created it opened the document 2 days later and this effect occurs.This is a very big problem, which cost me many hours of work. I have saved the document regularily uring the work.Createddocument.xmlI have found the document.xml has been generated in the wrong way by the Libre Office save mechanism.I have reformatted it so it can be seen better (in the attachment) and there is the following error if I try tov alidate the xml document:The 'w:hyperlink' start tag on line 1281 position 5 does not match the end tag of 'w:p'. Line 1288, position 5.I looked there, and there is really the problem with the missing hyperlink tag.CreatedRepaired document with removed invalid hyperlink tagssame error was also on the line 1444.It seems this occurs every time, if I write the hyperlink paragraph and on the same line behind the hyperlink I add also the text comment, which is not formatted as hyperlink, but like the normal text, then still in the document.xml, there is generated a starting tag like <w:hyperlink r:id="rId31">- it seems the procedure, creating the hyperlink tag automatically generates in this case the start for new hyperlink in such case, but not always - in the text lower there I can find it also correctly. But somehow it that way it can be generated, I guess - just make in the paragraph the hyperlink and try to add text behind the hyperlink into the same paragraph.I have removed the lines with invalid hyperlink start before this simple text, so it were the lines (in the previously uploaded document.xml): <w:hyperlink r:id="rId27"> <w:hyperlink r:id="rId31"> <w:hyperlink r:id="rId36"> <w:hyperlink r:id="rId39"> <w:hyperlink r:id="rId46"> <w:hyperlink r:id="rId49"> <w:hyperlink r:id="rId52">And I have inserted the document.xml back to the original odt archive and now it opens (There is also 1 Problem for me, because I have reformattted the document.xml in order to be able to perform the repair, so it has inserted a lot of <TAB> characters into the document, but this is not so big problem for me.)So, it seems, the problem is in the LibreOffice export procedure to docx, which created the invalid document.xml file and the importer then does not import anything, what is behind the first false (unfinished) hyperlink tag, what seems to be the expected behavior for such cases.I assumeis the already corrupted file, please attach the file before it was corrupted and the steps take to reproduce the corruption. => NEEDINFO(also please dont confirm your OWN reports by moving them from UNCONFIRMED to NEw, thanks)Sorry for changing the status.Unfortunatelly, I have reated the document in libre office directly and just saved it as docx, so there is was odt available. I will try to reproduce the steps again.Sorry for typing errors:... there was no odt created...Unfortunatelly, I canot reproduce it right now. What I remember, there was involved also the copy of the text with the links from Iceweasel (Firefox) :-(.Would close it as not reproducable usually, but making it a dupe of fdo#76316 now as they appear to be very similar.*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***

When exporting it as xlsx those cells will break when opening in Excel. Just FYI.Ah, Excel added FORMULATEXT function in Excel 2013 and we map our FORMULA to that one. Unfortunately I only have Excel 2007 here on my machine so I can't verify that part, but then this bug report is about references not the FORMULA function mapping...I'll exclude round-tripping with FORMULA functions which should be handled in a separate bug.

While the reference in the cell appears to be correct, the value displayed is incorrect. For example, in the sheet I tested, the formula in the cell appears as =$Coefficients.I20 both before and after saving.

Thanks to all who orchestrated the correction.As a note to caxilbund's, I reported a similar experience in, though it's not a bug. About the same time the sheet reference issue arose, I found that certain formulas were displaying numeric zero, even if they were simply copying a text entry from another cell. It turned out to be a manual versus automatic recalculation issue. At the guidance of m.a.riosv, I set the Recalculation-on-file-load option to Always and all is good. From the Calc menu, choose Tools > Options... > LibreOffice Calc > Formula.I think a similar issue occurs as follows:Create 2 sheets, say Sheet1 and Sheet2Type some numbers in cells of Sheet1.Then refer to them on Sheet2 e.g.: =Sheet1.A1 etc.Sum these the cells of Sheet2 e.g.: =SUM(A1:A3)Select the cell that has the sum (and the next to it) and move them lower.In Sheet2, the Sheet1 references will disappear, leaving you with =A1 !!!Sorry I meant to have theas bug reopened!I can't reproduce your issue with:VersiÃ³n: 4.2.8.2 Id. de compilaciÃ³n: 48d50dbfc06349262c9d50868e5c1f630a573ebdNot being the same issue, please open a new bug report, is the way, and best to avoid long threads.

id=76663	Example: enter following in cells A1:A4: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4. In cell C1 enter following array function: {=PRODUCT(1+A1:A4)-1}. Correct answer is 1.4024 = ((1.1)*(1.2)*(1.3)*(1.4))-1. LibreOffice Calc ver. 4.0.6.2 returns answer of 1.1840, which is equivalent to {=PRODUCT(1+A2:A4)-1} or ((1.2)*(1.3)*(1.4))-1. LibreOffice Calc is performing the computation, but ignoring the first number in cell A1. The error is not obvious on its face and might not be detected. The consequences could be devastating for users relying on LibreOffice to perform critical work.

Eagerly awaited.There was no 4.1.6.3 and the release was build before the change appeared on the branch. It would be in 4.1.7 if we released that.Verified with:Win7x64UltimateVersion: 4.2.5.0.0+ Build ID: b26b9606efa30c0a44e20dcf638fbd1e27f05089 TinderBox: Win-x86@42, Branch:libreoffice-4-2, Time: 2014-05-06_06:43:43Version: 4.3.0.0.alpha1+ Build ID: a1dd961c3093f5f7624e4d1f2240e9120fd13f23 TinderBox: Win-x86@39, Branch:master, Time: 2014-05-06_11:47:48Still in:Version: 4.2.4.2 Build ID: 63150712c6d317d27ce2db16eb94c2f3d7b699f8Filename: LibreOffice_4.2.4.2_Win_x86.msiPath: /libreoffice/old/4.2.4.2/win/x86/LibreOffice_4.2.4.2_Win_x86.msiSize: 209M (219451392 bytes)Last modified: Mon, 05 May 2014 22:19:21 GMT (Unix time: 1399328361)(In reply to)Are you sure?I have it fixed in version 4.2.4.2, Build ID: 63150712c6d317d27ce2db16eb94c2f3d7b699f8 on Windows 7-64No, please forgive me, I don't know what I did.Retrying again works for me with Version: 4.2.4.2 Build ID: 3150712c6d317d27ce2db16eb94c2f3d7b699f8Thanks Winfried.
id=76842	HelloBackground:We are a local government authority who made the decision to use an open source (StarOffice) office product when our XP desktop was deployed, back in 2006.Just over a year ago, we completed a move to Windows 7, and used this as an opportunity to replace StarOffice with LibreOffice.Current situation:On the whole, we don't receive many LibreOffice-related calls, but one which keeps plaguing us is one where LibreOffice keeps hanging on start.We've found a number of posts which suggest deleting the %appdata%\3\user\config\javasettings_windows_x86.xml file, and this does work, but due to the randomness of the fault, this isn't that great an option, seeing as we have more than 8500 users.Has this issue be fixed in more recent versions of LibreOffice?Are there any other files/registry/configurations changes which we could make to eradicate this problem?Please let me know if you need any more information.James Hi James, the version you indicated is rather old, did you test with 4.1.5 which is the last stable version? Hanging on start could depend on many different factors, so it's not easy if you don't have a recurrent case to analyse. SophieThanks for the repliesWe are using rather an old version, but on my travels whilst researching this issue, it seemed others were reporting it still exists in more recent versions too.We recently switched from Java 1.6.0_29 to 1.7.0_21 and had a huge number of calls from people who could no longer use LO.Whether these people had LO open when the Java update installed, I don't know, but this could be a good way of trying to reproduce the fault.CreatedClick on LO WriterCreatedErrorCreatedCorrupted fileCreatedFixed file after deleting duff oneCaught one in the act. This machine had Java 1.6.0_29 and was upgraded (via SCCM) to 1.7.0_21. The install routine we wrote for JRE1.7 uninstalls 1.6 and SHOULD delete the %appdata%\3\user\config\javasettings_windows_x86.xml file.The machine crashed out when trying to open ANY LibreOffice componenent, but after deleting the file and allowing it to recreate, it fired up first time.I've attached the file which was recreated after deleting the corrupted one, just for comparison. The Java folder is obviously different, but the rest of the file appears to be very similar.We've also tried unticking 'Java' in the LO settings, but it still tries checking for it. Why?If the file gets recreated each time, why store it at all?This is becoming a MASSIVE problem for us as the Java update gathers pace.Our service desk has taken over 90 calls since Monday and we've had to issue an emergency (hopefully) short-term botch which allows users to easily delete the file via a shortcut.We really need a fix for this.Can anyone help?FromHi James,On Thu, 2014-04-03 at 08:06 +0000, wrote:Of course Collabora can help - if you're willing / able to pay for support there. Just in case that's an option; it'd be interesting to have some moredetails: * why LibreOffice 3.6.x ? - is it for the legacy StarOffice binary file importers ? + assuming so - up-stream TDF do no 3.6.x releases anymore. * what deployment methods do you use to deploy fixes ? Of course, the ideal is that, assuming we can get the business pieces together, that we can find a workaround here for you that doesn't require a new build - but there's some hours of code reading & investigation needed first. Anyhow - if you're interested; we have the engineers that can do the work. ATB, Michael.Can Collabora please stop buzzing me with fake offers of help? I've already had a lengthy waste of time phone chat with Tim Isles, who, rather than wanting to help, was simply touting for business.He said Collabora couldn't help, well, not unless we spent a lot of money purchasing your 'hardened' version of LibreOffice and taking out a support contract, neither of which we are willing to do.What a great Open Source community spirit. Yeah, use our buggy software for free, but then pay us to fix the bugs.Thanks for absolutely nothing.James, can you understand that we are only volunteers here? by helping with Collabora or any other certified company you want, you are ensuring the continuity of the product you chosed to use and participate to the LibreOffice ecosystem. Now back to your bug, we need more information to understand what is happening in your particular environment and it's more than probable that with this missing information, no volunteers from the QA team will try to qualify your bug, not because he doesn't want whatever the time it will cost him, but because he can't.Back to need info - SophieThanks SophieSo what information would you like?I've posted screenshots and have posted before and after examples of the offending file.(In reply to)You didn't answer: did you test with 4.1.5 which is the last stable version?For your information, even if we provide a fix solving your problem, it will only be in our next version, we won't backport it to 3.6.1.2 which is EOL for us. This is why Collabora is not a fake offer of help, only professional support would fix a version that is EOL for the community. SophieJames; your approach to private mail is refreshingly unconventional. So, let me excerpt my reply:Sorry to waste your time; Tim works for me, I'll pass on the feedback.TDF doesn't encourage anyone to use 3.6.x - it's obsolete. TDF ingenerally encourages enterprises to engage commercial support over thelonger term to avoid exactly this sort of issue. One example might be:"The Document Foundation encourages large organizations deployingLibreOffice to do so in conjunction with a support partner, who cancarefully assess specific requirements, help manage migration andprovide bespoke fixes for identified issues. Purchasing LibreOfficesupport from a TDF partner also provides enterprises with an indirectmeans to contribute financially to the project, thereby funding itsdevelopment, improving its stability, and accelerating its growth."etc. I'm sorry for the situation you find yourself in; but on the other hand - have to sign the cheques for my engineers.All this aside - it is unlikely but possible that someone might help you for free; as such it may be useful to have more information here - particularly around what is possible for your scenario. I imagine in the absence of any new build - we'd need (somehow) to drop a new file or delete a file to work around this; as such it'd be useful to know what the capabilities of your central desktop management system is; so leaving NEEDINFO for now.It'd also be nice to confirm if the StarOffice binary file format issue is what keeps you on 3.6.x ? if not updating would be an option, if so - its a bit of a problem really.All the best.We haven't tested with 4.1.5, but if you Google the problem, there's evidence of this issue existing with other version.As I mentioned previously, upgrading 8500+ machines isn't a swift fix.I totally understand your comments about this support working on a voluntary basis, but if I was volunteering at a homeless shelter, I wouldn't be trying to sell people my brand of gravy to enhance the flavour of their free meal, I'd either give it to them for free (cos I'm kind), or not mention the gravy at all.When I posted this, I knew any help would be given on a goodwill, 'forum' type basis, and TBH I would rather nobody helped, than have people almost holding me to ransom by telling me I must purchase their services before I could or would get help.I'm grateful for your interest, but moving straight to the new version without some sort of guarantee the problem has been resoved would be too risky.Would you like some free gravy?(In reply to)

id=77080	When inserting rows in some distance to the cell containing summation, then the summation area is changed in severely wrong manner - totally unexpected.See examples (calc files and screenshot)1) Summations in row 5 and in row 9 (each column E)2) Marking some row numbers at the left border and choosing "insert rows" in the right-mouse-click context menue (and inserting nummer "5" in one of the new cells) shows correct and expected behaviour: the summations are not affected.3) Marking as much row numbers at the left border, that row 5 also is marked (to insert 4 rows above former row 3) - then the summation area is enlarged, wrongly including rows 5 to 8 (new counting), even though rows 7 and 8 are not changed, only transferred downwards.Expected behaviour: row 9 is not changed, relative adresses in the summation should still relate only to this row itself (before: row 5, afterwards: row 9) with no change into an rectangle area.4) Marking more row numbers at the left border and choosing "insert rows" leads to an even stranger behaviour: the summation area is enlarged, containing other blocks of numbers now.I proposed severity "major" and priority "high", since this behaviour really affected some complex spreasheets of mine during the last months.1) Totally wrong numbers arised (apparently in random manner)2) It was not easy to identify the source of that confusion.3) And even with that knowledge now - it is still much work to check all summations within the spreadsheet that could have been affected when inserting some rows. Createdspreadsheets before and after inserting rows, screenshots showing areas used in the formulafile upload was not successfully in the first stepHi. Your step-by-step is hard to follow, because the screenshots don't show the "ABCD" landmarks.You say that 1)-2) is right ; which is wrong, 1)-2)-3) or 1)-3) ? I didn't manage to reproduce the bug (LibO 4.2.2.1 on Win7). It would be kind of you to provide a more explicit step-by-step.Createdspreadsheet & screenshots, before & after inserting rowsload the spreadsheet and look at the screenshots to test the bugToday I updated manually (!!) LO, uninstalling vers. 4.2.2 and installing thevers. 4.2.2.3. Still the same bug exists!my OS is 64-bit Windows7 SP1edit; unistalling 4.2.2.1edit; unistalling 4.2.2.1This may be the same bug I just found. I have a spreadsheet with some cells containing sums of other cells. If I insert new rows above the sum range, the sum range is not adjusted correctly. The end of the range is correctly increased by the number of rows added, but the beginning of the range stays at the original value. The effect is that the formula now sums too many rows.I insert the rows by selecting several rows, then using Insert > Rows in the menu. The number of rows inserted does not seem to matter. If rows are deleted instead, both the start and end of the sum range are adjusted correctly.I found this in 4.2.3.3. I upgraded to 4.2.4.2, hoping that it had been fixed, but it's still there. I am using Windows 7.I tested this with version 4.0.1.2 on my old XP computer, and it does NOT have this bug.As I write this, I've done a little more playing around, and this seems to happen only if the rows I have selected in order to do the insert overlap the sum range. Example:Cell E14 contains =SUM(E4:E13)I want to add 7 rows after row 1, so I select rows 2-8 and then choose Insert > Rows in the menu.7 rows are added; cell E14 is now E21 and contains =SUM(E4:E20)It should contain =SUM(E11:E20), since the rows I added are outside the sum range.I've looked at Steffen's attachments now, and am pretty sure it is the same bug. Looking further at the bug lists, #77647 seems to be the same thing, and is listed as fixed in 4.2.5.0. That appears to be scheduled for release in June. I can probably work around the bug until then (just use multiple, smaller inserts that don't overlap the sum range).CreatedWorkflow video insertion/deletion rowsComment onWorkflow video insertion/deletion rowsLO vers. 4.2.4.2Using the command "insert rows above", after Selecting a row with a cell containing a reference to a range, the range is altered. Unexpected results, operating on the same Resulting range, even with the use of "Delete selected rows". The same thing happens with any command that uses the range.FURTHER COMMENTS:When this bug happens in a large spreadsheet, it causes the program to crash.When the crashed file is restored authomatically at the next start, in all the cells where there were functions, these are substituted by numbers!!This unaspected modification is "invisible": it happens without any warning from the program.On the contrary, using MS Office to open the restored ods file, a warning of defective file is given, and the "modified" cells are highlighted as errors.Now I'm back to using "Apache OpenOffice" vers. 4.1.0, as it does not have this very dangerous bug.Seems that enough informations provided, set UNCONFIRMEDI think we need expert opinion here.As Nancy said, perhaps duplicate to(In reply to)Following the test case, I can't reproduce under LO 4.2.5.2 - Ubuntu 12.04 x86. Perhaps related tofixing.Please REOPENED if anyone can reproduce in latest stable release(In reply to)Christian,maybe this bug was fixed under your "LO 4.2.5.2 - Ubuntu 12.04 x86".But I confirm that this bug still exists in the test ods file, opened with my LO 4.2.4.2 (Build ID: 63150712c6d317d27ce2db16eb94c2f3d7b699f8), which is the latest stable release in my Windows7 64-bit SP1 Operating system.Mariano, you can only reopen a bug if you can reproduce with same or higher version...not with older.. And don't forget to reset user profile to make sure its freshness.4.2.5 has arrived for Windows:*) Anyway, curently LO has no 64bit version for Windows
id=77328	I'm working on a rather large file (>100 pages) with a lot of footnotes (> 100 per chapter, 6 chapters).ODT format.Cross references to footnotes are all wrong, both page numbers and footnote number.If I enter a cross reference (e.g. "see footnote n. 23, at page 40"), it then outputs a reference to some other footnote and page (e.g. "see footnote n. 2, at page 5"). Usually it refers to low numbers, like in the example.Unfortunately I can not provide the file as an example, but I think the problem can be easily replicated since it shows in all computer I have worked with, since at least v. 4.1 of LO.In the file there are also Zotero references.For a research paper like mine this makes LO unusable, so please do something about it asap! Confirming this bug for a document involving 133 footnotes, the final section of which (from fn. 127 onwards) needed to repeat fn. 127 as a cross-reference 4 times, and fns. 128-129 as cross-references once each. When attempted in the original document, the cross-references would appear as references to random footnotes, often about halfway through the document (e.g., a cross-ref. intended for fn. 127 would appear -- and link to -- fn. 66). When I copied that section out of the document and into a new document, set up the cross-references as necessary with only 13 footnotes, and then copied it back to the original document, it appears to have worked. This is clearly not a solution had I needed the cross-references to be to distant sections of the document.Createdfootnotes are zero-numberedComment onfootnotes are zero-numberedI'm working on a large .odt file with 248 pages, 71870 words, 499467 characters. If I try to add a corss reference to a footnote, the list shows many of them zero-numbered.Createdfootnotes are no more zero-numbered clicking on the firstIf I click on the first zero-numbered footnote, numbers change starting from 1 and links do work.EDIT: I tried once again but it didn't work. Sorry. Footnotes numbers are still zero. Clicking on a cross reference goes to the wrong footnote.So, LibreOffice is unusable for me. Shall I remove all cross references to footnotes?I want to report similar bug for LO 4.2.4.2 debian paketIn a document with 393197 characters, 49543 words, 119 pages 26 chapters and 198 footnotes the cross references to chapter of a footnote always contains ??.cross references to footnote number and footnote page, that didn't work in 4.2.3.3 seem to be fixed in 4.2.4.2.I've tried this on 4.1.6.2 and notice no issues with a footnote 88 on page 48 (Total 77 pages). Can you all please provide the earliest version this bug is seen? The version field says 4.2.2.1 while OP says "at least v. 4.1".According to, "cross references to footnote number and footnote page, that didn't work in 4.2.3.3 seem to be fixed in 4.2.4.2." Can others confirm?Now I'm using LibreOffice 4.2.5.2.If I open an ".odt" document containing 608068 characters and 298 pages and immediately I try to add a cross-reference, footnotes numbers start always from 0, so the bug still remains.But if I try again after having done something, footnotes start from 1.It appears a random behaviour; don't know what unlock the program.Never CONFIRMED so UNCONFIRMED is the appropriate status.Please provide a sample document.

Hoping someone can duplicate this bug and suggest a work-around.CreatedSample of the DB form used when LO would not "Add Record"This a dummy of the original DB form that stopped allowing "Save Record" and "Add Record" after 17 records created. For some reason, the "dummy" will not add a record beyond #1.Any chance there's a work-around for this bug?If not, the LO database is totally USELESS.(In reply to)You have added only a form, not the database. Please attach the *.odb-file.Following Robert's comment, I put it as NEEDINFO.Judith: may I suggest you to give a try to 4.2.4 since there won't be any new official release with 4.1 branch? (last 4.1.X version is 4.1.6)No feedback since several months, I put it INVALID since we can't even give it a try.Judith: don't hesitate to reopen this tracker if you still reproduce this with last LO version (4.2.6 or 4.3.0) and please attach an example file in this case.

if not interested / available / appropriate, please remove youselves.(This is an automated message.)LibreOffice development currently prioritizes bugs with the so called MAB (most annoying bugs) -- as this bug has not run through that process (including writing a short rationale for this bug being a candidate and other who are watching the tracker bug silently approving that rationale etc.) its priority is set to high. Note this is effectively no change in the urgency assigned to this bug, as we are currently not making a difference between high and highest and severity is untouched.You can find out more about MABs and how the process works by contacting libreoffice qa on irc:The QA wiki page also gives you hints on how to get in contact with the team (if IRC fails you, your next best choice is the mailing list):And regressions () get ignored as no longer being MAB ?I give up. Seriously, what is the point of all the testing if this is the kind of "automated" response that a QAer gets ? When was this decided ?I don't see it in the minutes of the latest dev IRC, merely that a discussion took place.Alex, don't take this personally. I don't think it was done in bad intention.Raising back to "highest" since* broken core functions (or is using videos in presentations not a core functionality?)* happens frequently, 100% of times to be exactso from the flowchart this qualifies as Highest, Blocker.Maybe because it's "only" OSX makes it less bad? Also video usage in presentation is still a major pain on all platforms (linux seems to work a little if you're lucky, while OSX and windows seem to be completely broken. So it would be great of the dev team, to address this core functionality bug.(In reply to)Steve, not taking it personally at all, just a tad narked that yet again, a whole swathe of reports get the automatic whitewash treatment - surely, if the keyword regression is in the report, then the query used to decide whether or not to send out the automatic response is not working properly ?Compare that with the fact that a new feature, introduced in 4.3 development (the OSX toolbar gradient) and which happens to not work as intended gets prioritized to MAB because it is a regression. Either it is a regression because the new development, aimed at and for OSX, screwed up LO on OSX only, as in the present video mess up, or else one takes the view that as it is a newly implemented feature that doesn't work properly, and it shouldn't have made it into the mainstream product (I thought that was what we had the "experimental" setting for). In the latter case, it shouldn't then become a MAB. Anyway, I digress.Does changing the importance back to highest put back the link to MAB, it doesn't appear to have done that. Bjoern's reset appears to have removed this from the MAB list, since the link is no longer referenced.Hi Alex; Wow this is a hugely long bug to read =) I didn't have time to get to the end of it.Any mention of VLC / Mplayer is a red-herring. We tried to integrate with VLC for GSOC, and wrote some code for that, and its a nightmare in its current state.So - I'd say step #1 - check that we're not turning that on in product builds for any platform; it's likely to break stuff.If there is any program/*avmediavlc* library inside the install, can you delete it and see if that fixes things ?Beyond that - I imagine that this is something bisectable if it used to work and now is broken.Looking here on Linux for no reason I understand libavmediavlc.so exists on my system. I guess a simple fix here is to simply turn that off with extreme prejudice.please Mac users, retest with 4.3.x or 4.4.x recent buildsif bug is still present please move this from mab4.2 list to mab4.3 list since 4.2.x reached the end of lifeStill present in 4341 and master 4500 alphaVideo playback with the test files attached to the bug report :MP4 : audio and video playback in Impress preview and fullscreen mode3GP : audio and video playback In Impress preview and fullscreen modeFLV, WEBM, OGV, AVI - unsupported and can not even be inserted into Impress slideCreatedSmall 3GP test fileI tested this with TDF build 4.4.2.2 on OS X 10.9.

See(). That bug report was opened 2012-06-06. In comment number 8 there the user named Rainer Bielefeld Retired says: "Same effect with AOOo 3.4.1, so seems inherited from OOo.". He also said: "If this is a general problem that is very serious [...]".Reproduce this bug by making a fresh Writer document. Apply outline numbering to Heading 1. Save as .doc or .docx, exit. Reopen. Apply Heading 1 to some text in the middle of doc. Added chapter gets no outline number. After reapplying outline numbering to 'Heading 1' numbering is wrong (i.e. the headings formatted in this "session" get numbers starting from 1). See uploaded example doc.Comment onOutline numbering gets restarted every time doc is openedAttached file contains a doc w/ outline numbering applied to Heading 1. Every time the doc is reopened (which I call a "session") and style 'Heading 1' is applied to some text in the middle of the doc, then that heading gets no number. If one reapplies outline numbering to 'Heading 1' then the outline numbering of the text to which 'Heading 1' was applied in this session restarts at 1.(In reply to meneerjansen00 from)-- "Outline Numbering for DOCX not working when new headings inserted in between", and related-- "FILEOPEN DOC/DOCX: automatic numbering in numbered lists different from Word numbering" are both long present import/export filter issues.Native ODF format of outline numbers are not affected when kept in that format, so while annoying the bugs are not really new nor are they MAB candidates.Also, no need to attach issue specific files to the Metabugs--attachements belong with the individual issues.(In reply to V Stuart Foote from)I take it then that we do not have to count on (work starting on) a fix for this bug to come anytime soon? That will be quite disappointing for a lot of LO users I'm afraid...(In reply to meneerjansen00 from)Not at all, work on the WW8 import/export filters is continual. For example, if you follow the samples and discussion ofthere has been noted improvement. Otherwise, concise test cases with annotated comparisons in the XML of OOXML and ODF rendering of the sample documents will provide needed incentive to devs for correcting the filters. That as opposed to general statements that it is "not working".In general, differences in XML structure--in describing styles and direct formatting--is what goes awry with the filter conversion process. Microsoft handles things "differently" in OOXML to the XML LO composes in ODF. The filters have to resolve the difference--an ongoing development task. The MS .DOC formats are more robust (and less dynamic), but do also have round trip filter issues--just fewer of them.Filing useful bug reports aside, a user can put the onus back on Microsoft and export from there as ODF (e.g. .odt), rather than OOXML (e.g. .docx). Or in a more parochial sense work only in LibreOffice rendered ODF--that is what LibreOffice as a project is obliged to support.(In reply to V Stuart Foote from)I'm afraid I do not see a lot of improvement in that bub. I do see some discussions. But no patch or suggested solution. I'm sorryI'm afraid you lost me there. I'm willing to do anything youy want me to. But I do not understand what y'all would like me to give. Is the example doc not good enough? Can you not reproduce the bug? Please help me to provide you with the proper testing documents. On a side note, the description inis crystal clear to me. And very reproducable. I'm afraid I do not know waht the devs would like more. If I would, I'd provide y'all with what you want in the bug report you want. I'd like to help or provide input, but I really do not know how anymore.commnent #3 is so clear already...In this hard dog eat dog worl I'm afraid the smaller fish has to accept that the bigger fish is boss. Same thing goed for LaTeX (www.latex-project.org) and any other way to produce documents.Best regards, Jansen@V Stuart Foote I'm gonna have to read up on the Office Open XML (OOXML) format/file type (which, confusingly to me, is called .docx in LO), the native Word 2007 (and higher Word versions) file format (also called .docx) and ye 'ol .doc format. This is not to be confused w/ the 'open document file' (ODF) format which, I believe, has been used by Libre- and OpenOffice since a long time. Documents in the ODT format have the extension .odT (with the T from Text, not the D for document) which is also confusing to me (I thought that native LO and 'ye 'ol OOo documents ndend in .odF). I found a nice article about this:Sorry for all this off topic stuff by me that really belongs in a chat or support forum. I'm getting old. Back in the days there was only M$ Word (i.e. .doc) and OpenOffice (which I thought saved in the .odf extension).As for now, what I did to create a document that my Word loving friends can read, edit and save is: 1. Open Libre Office.2. Create new Writer document.3. Write some text.4. Choose: File > Save as > Microsoft Word 97/2000/XP/2003 (.doc). FYI: I used to choose .doc because I thought that .docx was less well supported in OOo/LO... 5. Or I choose: File > Save as > Microsoft Word 2007/2010/2013 XML (.docx)I never even noticed that in LO there's also an option way down at the bottom called "Office Open XML (.docx)". Until today I've never heard of this format. Until today I really couldn't give a rats *ss 'bout M$'s fiddling w/ .doc and .docx format. I just don't care. If people want to use proprietary software and operating systems that's their problem, not mine. Boy was I wrong! I'll try to create an .docx LO (that is Office Open XML, not Microsoft .docx!) document and I'll test if the outline numbering probelm is also there.As for me the question remains how MS Word 2007+ handles OOXML .docx files that were created by LO. Does it leave LO's .docx format intact or not? And how does LO handle M$ created .docx files, does the outline numbering bug appear of doesn't it? To be continued. Hope y'all will forgive me all the confusion I might have created and the overly long comments that posted here. One is never to old to learn. :-)1. Reading the blog that I mentioned earlier is highly recommended for all people who have ever used MS Office '97 to 2003! See:It clarifies why there are two ways of saving a document as .docX!2. Tried to reproduce the bug by making a document in LO and saving it in Office Open OOXML format (i.e. NOT MS's version of OOXML/docX!).3. Bug still there.4. When one saves the document in LO's native open document format (ODF, confusingly ending in .odT) bug is not there.Conclusion: the bug does not have anything to do with Microsoft's crappy implementation of the OOXML standard. The bug has to do w/ the way Libre Office generates a document in the the OPEN document standard OOXML (confusingly also called .docx, not LO's fault, see aforementioned blog).This bug, strangely enough, probably has nothing to do w/. Microsoft!CreatedTwo documets made w/ LO in OOXML format and re-saved as...Two test documents. Both made in LO. One is saved as OOXML (LO's version of OOXML, not MS's version!). The other was made in LO, saved as OOXML (it had the bug) and after that saved as .odT which only made the bug disappear after reapplying ALL outline numbered styles. So using .odt as an intermediate when ou receice a Word doc will not work.(In reply to meneerjansen00 from)No worries, only request is that comments be moved to the affected, or, and not continue on this meta issue tracker :)Its just noise here...Darn it!

id=78477	CreatedTrueType font fileGreetings, I'm using LibreOffice 4.1.4.2 from the backports repository of Debian Linux 7, with some thousand files in my ~/.font directory, which keeps growing up as I'm collecting fonts since a long time ago. It was possible to isolate, via strace, a segmentation fault in libvcllo.so, which prevented LibreOffice from starting at all. Removing from ~/.fonts just a couple of fonts (one is attached here; they seem to belong to the same family) allowed LibreOffice to start flawlessly again. Opening the fonts with gnome-font-viewer allowed to see they're made only of numeric digits and some symbol; which is not expected to cause a segmentation fault anyway. It must be something in the file structure. I'm unsure about the weakness creating this problem, apparently due to some poor handling of bad/unexpected data. If it's located in lower level components used by libvcllo.so, then I shall move the problem to the Debian maintaners for sure. If, however, it is due to LibreOffice itself, solving this problem might even close unconfirmed/unreproduceable situations sharing the same cause; which seems an opportunity too important to ignore. Is anyone capable/willing to test this with other versions of LibreOffice and/or Linux? The test isn't supposed to corrupt your system, if the behavior is the same I experienced then it will be sufficient to remove the offending font to get LibreOffice running again. Thanks. best regards Marcello Is this bug still valid / reproducible with the latest LO release? Currently 4.2.4:Please also try resetting your user profile and let us know if that helps:Should this be still reproducible for you with the latest LO release please set this bug back to UNCONFIRMED. Should this issue be solved set it to WORKSFORME.Setting to NEEDINFO until more detail is provided.(In reply to)Yes. That took more than expected, sorry for the delay.Debian 7 apparently does not allow to remove Libreoffice packages coming from their repository without taking down GNOME3 itself. I had no time to test a mixed setup on that same workstation.The tests continued within a lower priority x86_64 machine, a PearOS6.1 (Ubuntu 12.04 derivative) which was born with an old LO3 so seldom used I couldn't tell when the last time was. A freshly downloaded LO4.2.4.2 (thanks for the direct link) was put in place even before thinking to test LO3 itself. The problem turned to be reproduceable with no differences at all.Analysis details follow.The splash screen with the progress bar will just disappear while the progress bar is still incomplete and nothing more will happen. The segfault is silent, so difficult to detect that one could doubt that an error of such magnitude actually took place. If you launch LO from a terminal window, you will get nothing on stdout nor stderr. Check the dmesg command for the latest system events, and it's there.The output from 'strace -f loffice' will report the open system call for the offending font (the one provided or, supposedly, any other one causing the same effect) just a few lines before the segfault. That was the only hint suggesting to remove the last font accessed by the application.That was not needed, as the old and new version of LO on the test system are different by major release. Removing the two offending fonts (which were already on place, as I periodically rsynced some data from a network share) was sufficient.Now. Thanks for your attention.Really strange one - at first I thought it was a bug with the font but it's a regression.

JBFHi Diarmuid,Was the file originally a ms word document? And if so, can you provide us with that file.the reason is the image which has ridiculous 5 kilometer clipping area: fo:clip="rect(531404.655cm, 0cm, 0cm, 0cm)"that causes some overflow in drawing layer, a rectangle withnegative height, an IllegalArgumentException that is not handled,and then a crash...it's of course also triggered by our good friend commit 2e51675so this is related to, presumably the documentwas a WW8 doc that has been converted to ODF?looks like we need some cut-off value there too...fixed on masterMichael Stahl committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#80009: xmloff: ignore excessive fo:clip valuesThe patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

The doc is 14 pages long.If I try to insert a heading or sometimes only a text on a specific place in the doc, libreoffice is running into a loop an beginns to count page numbers.

How can we workaround the issue? (I could create a dev environment, if it helps, but would need some support on it)As you see I have managed to provide stacktraces, so I think I could provide also more details on the errors, if someone hepls me.Hi Hkais,Is it possible for you to check earlier versions of libreoffice, which you can open the document with and scramble its contents without it crashing, so that you can provide us with a sample document.You can find portable of old versions at these linksSetting this to NEW as it as a backtrace that devs can look at and i had set to to NeedAdvice.CreatedOriginal file, wich, If I open in Document writer, go on endless page creation loopWhen I open that document in .docx, or I convert it to .odt, the document go to endless page creation.Thanks for your help on that strange case.Migrating Whiteboard tags to Keywords: (needAdvice)I can't repro this in LibreOffice 5.1 with the sample file, either by adding headings and typing text, or by saving to ODT.Can you please try again with the latest version and if it still happens, try to give any more guidance on how to repro?So openingin master and the endless page counting happens without me doing any editing and it reached over 2 thousand pages before i closed the document when the document only has 56 pages and all during that time its eating 80+ percent of my cpu.In earlier versions, like the OP mentioned, once you start editing the document (i was adding page breaks on radom pages), the endless page counting happens and if it doesnt happen, attempt to go to the last page of the document and you'll see it start then.

is the same for 4.3 and 4.4 - it is somewhat unclear why this doesn't fail there too - presumably well worth investigating that =)Ideally all these pointers would have fast intrusive references on them I suppose.Pushed a patch to gerrit, awaiting review from Kohei / Markus.Michael Meeks committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-4-2":fdo#80813 - avoid FMR by re-fetch pattern after a potential re-calculation.It will be available in LibreOffice 4.2.6.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.Removing bibisectrequest - doesn't seem necessary since there is a backtrace and Michael has already pushed a patchStill not completely happy about why this doesn't happen in 4.3 / master - the code looks ~the same there; perhaps we don't do load time calculation and its just hidden; but I loaded the same doc. in valgrind and did a shift-ctrl-F9 to force re-calc and ... nothing; so ...Reluctantly closing for now; should be in the next 4.2.x ...

Build ID: 62ad5818884a2fc2e5780dd45466868d41009ec0(In reply to)Thank you,this workaround works also on GNU/Linux. The appropriate file is located in package libobasis<version>-<lang>-math_*. For me the smcs.res from libobasis4.2-cs-math_4.2.5.2-2_amd64.deb works fine.Btw.: it seems, that the libobasis4.3-en-gb-math_4.3.0.4-4_amd64.deb file also includes broken symbol definition, since it did not help me.Thaks once again.Still not fixed in 4.3.1.1 (Windows 8.1), german GUI; WorkaroundHad to adapt the workaround quirk:I've found the following workaround quirk:Replacing the "..program\resource\smde.res" resp. "smfr.res", "smes.res" etc. bythe english version *smen-US.res* (was smen.res in older vesion) will do the trick: lower case greek symbols Ã  la "%pi" are working again.Another workaround:Replacing the smde.res (or others) by an old version from 4.2 works too, and it has the advantage using the correct spelling (by replacing with the smen_US.res one must then use the english spelling of variables).(In reply to)Workaround works for me (Win 8.1). Thanx.Just to let you know: The bug occurs only when updating. A fresh installation (done on a new tablet pc with no LibreOffice installed) works as expected.With Mageia 5 ( Build ID: 4.3.1.1-1.mga5 ), I have this problem.Not reproducible for me under Ubuntu 14.04 x86-64:- Version: 4.3.2.0.0+ (Build ID: b2d54aa61607e477cb4b81f1a70e555ee3adb0af)- Version: 4.4.0.0.alpha0+ (Build ID: e6369973702286d92bfc34ab8305d4a9bcf5c27e)both versions build at home.Best regards. JBFSame problem with LO 4.3.1.1 french/Win Seven 64Dataloss : with french LO 4.3.1.11 - create a doc including a formula with a working version of LO or AOO2 - in the formula just add %pi, close the formula editor (you can see Ï)3 - with LO 4.3.1.1 open the doc (you still can see Ï), open the formula. you can see %PI has replaced %pi. Close the editor then you will see that Î  has replaced Ï4 - make any change to the doc, save and close5 - Open the doc with a working LO or AOO the Î  is definitively in the formulaAs this bug seems to be in 4.2.5.2 shouldn't it be a MAB 4.2, not a MAB 4.3 ?And, as there is an unusable function and data loss, shouldn't it be a blocker ?I have the same problem in LO 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.0.4.A bibisect would be fantastic here in helping us resolve the problem:(In reply to)@Joel: I don't know how we can do a bibisect on this bug: it appears *only* with locales, and intermediate builds are only English US (if I'm not wrong).No problem in 4.2.6.2 french LO/7x64Still broke in version 4.3.1.2 Windows 8, x64, german locale***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***All suggestions below don't work with LO for MAC OS X in pt-Br.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Yes, still buggy, also on Debian GNU/Linux x86_64, version 4.3.1.2...(In reply to)***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Can't be bibisected.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Hi, I tried all workarounds in the Italian locale with no success: any substitution of smit.res with the US version from the same install or the italian version from Openoffice 4.0.1 did not get the symbols back.I have now painstakingly readded manually all missing Greek letters one by one, I am still not sure this works with already existing formulas since in some experiments when re-editing old formulas lowercase names of symbols added manually when turned into uppercase.I have experimented a little bit more and tragically my manual effort to recreate missing symbols in the formula catalog does NOT work 100%:- when I create a formula I can insert lowercase Greek letters and they appear correctly;- upon re-editing such formulas, all Greek letters that have an UPPERCASE equivalent (for example sigma and SIGMA) are automatically turned into uppercase, corrupting your formula completely.You are then forced to reconvert manually to lower case all symbols that are actually so; but this works only until the next editing, when the devilish automatic uppercase conversion will take place again....Any workaround to this would be greatly welcome.Further, complicated, news:the problem described in the previous comment (unwanted automatic uppercase conversion) seems to appear not always but in only some instances:- when you edit the formula for the first time after opening the file where it is contained, but not in further editing instances in the same session. If you close the file and reopen it, the first editing will induce it again.- when you copy and paste the formula between two different document types: for example, if you have a formula in a Writer doc and copy and paste it into a new calc sheet, wrong uppercase conversion will take place; if you instead copy and paste it into another Writer doc, it will not. The same will happen in the opposite direction (from a calc sheet to a writer doc), and also when copying it to an Impress file etc from a different file type.For anybody needing to create and edit many formula, this a complete nightmare.Thus, creating manually the lowercase symbols is not a practically useful workaround.Thanks for your attentionI am sorry, but all efforts to clarify a defined mechanism for the problem is failing. Now I am experiencing unwanted uppercase conversion even in the same document when I copy and paste a second instance of a formula.What is happening seems to be somehow changing from time to time.As told in, this bug should be considered as a blockerUnusable function and data loss In one week 6 bugs has been marked as a duplicate of this one, 16 users are following this bugLO 4.3.2.1 should be for this week, and the bug isn't solved (is anyone working on it ?)The only workaround is to go back to 4.2.6Do you have the problem with a fresh installation (uninstall first the current version) and a clean new user profile?Still no problem for me with LO 4.3.2.0.0+ build at home under Ubuntu 14.04 x86-64 with en-US and FR langpacks.Best regards. JBFWhat do you mean by a "fresh" install? If you simply uninstall the previous version before installing the new one, all your personalized settings will be maintained, and this is probably not what you mean by a "clean new user profile".However, the problem is that I have literally dozens if not hundreds of personalised settings, and I would have to ponder carefully if this trial is worth wiping them all and restart personalizing the program again from scratch. A hell of a waste of time to be sure.I could do this experiment on an old PC in my office, maybe tomorrow I'll give it a try.In any case, to be clear all my posts refer exclusively to LibreOffice Italian localization. I have never tried any other.No need to delete - just back up the folder and delete the original. Then you can at least see if it's profile related:I have now uninstalled 4.3.1 and installed again 4.3.0.4, the missing symbols in the catalog problems - as well as the uppercase unwanted conversion - seems to be there as well.Downgrading to 4.2.6.3 the uppercase automatic conversion is NOT present.I had re-aded lowercase Greek letters manually, so I cannot tell if they would automatically be here now - however, the iGreek category that exhibited the same problem is now restored, so probably everything is Ok here with 4.2.6***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***@AndyYou said to have added all missing Greek letters. Did you add also their lowercase names? Else, they will not be recognized in your formulas.regards,JacquesActually I don't think there should be any difference between fresh install and update/reinstall, at least on GNU/Linux. Since the bug is caused by broken symbol table for Math (e.g. smcs.res in CS locale), included in package libobasisX.Y-cs-math_X.Y.A.B-C_amd64.deb and installed in /opt/libreoffice4.3/program/resource, which is not a directory changeable by user, the behaviour should be the same in both cases (unless a user-defined symbol table exists in user's profile folder).Another proof of guilt of this file is its filesize. In version 4.2.5.2, which works good for me, its filesize is 63152 bytes (in package libobasis4.2-cs-math_4.2.5.2-2_amd64.deb). In version 4.3.0.4, which is the first broken, the filesize of smcs.res shrunk to 60716 bytes, and in 4.3.1.2 the filesize is the same.A funny thing is, that the conversion from lowercase greek letters to uppercase greek letters appears ONLY with broken symbol table. When I use older smcs.res file from LO 4.2.5.2, it does not appear.My suggestion is simply to compare smXX.res files from older locales of LO and if they are larger than current ones, there is a large probability, that this locale is currently buggy.Regards,Karel Hruska(In reply to)In response to Jacques:You said to have added all missing Greek letters. Did you add also their lowercase names? Else, they will not be recognized in your formulas.Yes, I have added them in the sense that I:- clicked the "edit..." button in the Catalog window;- in the editing window I clicked on the lowercase Greek letter I wanted in the matrix showing all symbols;- then I modified its name in the first field in the lower half of the window, giving it the name it had in older releases;- for example, when you choose the lowercase sigma this fields shows "Ux03C3", I replaced this text with "sigma", then clicked on "add" the buttons on the lower right side of the windowThe same procedure was repeated manually for all other lowercase Greek letter missing, i.e. all those whose name does not begin with the prefix "var" (these are the only ones left in 4.3.1). This would have been annoying but doable if it resolved the issue while waiting for a fix; however the problem is that this manually created symbols caused the "unwanted uppercase conversion" when using the manually created symbols that I described. It looks as if there were an auto-check of formula code correctness, and this could not take into account symbols added by the user...I have partially solved the problem after I removed the LO user config files, in MAC [~/Library/Application/LibreOffice] after that the lowercase Greek letters works in default user interface. However, if I change the user interface to PT-BR the problem returns.To me, the Greek letters is more important that the user interface.Please let me for once add a comment which is "political" rather than "technical": to me, the difficulties caused by bugs such as this are not only due to my own production work with LO. If it were just for this (which is of course important) any workaround, even a difficult to implement one, would do.The problem is that I am a teacher and use LO in lectures continuously, and do this both because it a free software and to spread its usage and appreciation.So how can I go in class to teach statistics and tell students that the app is so buggy that you cannot write math formulas anymore, or that you must apply arcane procedures to be able to do that again, or that you must change locale?So I agree, to ME personally, locale is quite unimportant, but for the context where I use LO with the public, switching locale to a foreign one is simply unthinkable, unless you do not care making LO the object of blatant complaints, people not wanting to use it, etc.Unfortunately this is at present the case also with another bug, n. 83461, related to a significant bug in the "frequency" function, something that I use everyday in class. If you have a look at it and would like to express interest, it would be nice. Thanks for your attention,Confirmed in 4.3.1.2, locale LT (Lithuanian), system Kubuntu 14.04 (64b): lower-case "beta" is missing.On pc Debian x86-64 with LO Debian package 4.3.0.4, I could reproduce this.However, I don't reproduce this with master sources updated yesterday.Could someone give a try to a daily build (master sources)? (see)Hi Julien,There's no issue with master. Problems come with locale helppack installation, and errors in "smxx.res". There, uppercase letters wording only is the visible difference.JacquesAnother workaround I found with Arch Linux' s Fresh package of 4.3.1.2. If you add the symbols manually in your locale and then change the interface language to English, the lower-to-upper conversion stops somehow and even reverts. Not sure why though.Another workaround I found with Arch Linux' s Fresh package of 4.3.1.2. If you add the symbols manually in your locale and then change the interface language to English, the lower-to-upper conversion stops somehow and even reverts. Not sure why though.I can reproduce this issue on 4.3.1.2/OSX with the "de" language pack.However, if I take a fresh build from master and add the contents of the "de" language pack from 4.3.1.2*, it works as expected - e.g. a lower case %sigma is now shown correctly.Although mixing and matching versions and langpacks is probably not recommended in general, if the problem is in fact already fixed in master this might provide a path for finding where through bisection?(* Language packs don't seem to be built for the dailies and I'm not sure of the procedure for building them from source)Functionality is still broken in 4.3.2.1 French Seven/x64broken symbol tableI confirmed same problem with version 4.3.1.2 French, installed on Windows 7 (built).Uncontrolled lower to upper case modifications. Tried to uninstall, delete all personal settings in "Roaming", then re-install same built. No way, still the same mess. Old files created with with version V4.1 and read-only protected (were not modified with v4.3) are immediately contaminated when opened with v 4.3.1.2.This is a plain disaster, due to the high number of formulae that need now to be restored.I will try replace my French locale version by a US one, but hope it will support the French keyboard and already written text with accents and special character set.I hope someone will be able to fix that bug, otherwise the efforts of all non-English LO communities that need Math will become a bit vain... regards, FTfound the problemDavid Tardon committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":fdo#80650 src transl. merge must be case sensitiveThe patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

When you create a NEW document and save it password protected, than the created document is shown in the start center with as readable thumbnail! Only when you remove the thumbnail from the start center and reopen the document with "File->Open" it is recognized as a protected document an the thumbnail is iconized.(In reply to Rudolf Kollien from)Can't reproduce with 4.3.3.2 under Fedora 20. Could you please try with a clean profile?(One thing that could happen is that you had in the past some non-protected document with the same path. Each time you open the start center, it checks the availability of all the recent files. If some file is missing - it doesn't remove it from the list, but just hides it. So it's possible that the thumbnail actually left from an old file with the same name, that you had at some point in the past.)In this case unfortunately no: it's a completely new document with an unique name. Never had a document named like the one.I can confirm the following:* If you open a NEW file and save it first time round with a password, then NO content is displayed in the thumbnail. (Desired behaviour)* If you have a normal unprotected file already written before and you decide to save it with a password, then some content of the file (taken before the password implementation) is still visible in the thumbnail. (Can be undesired)Version: 4.3.2.2.0+ Build ID: 430m0(Build:2) backport on Debian Wheezy(In reply to Rudolf Kollien from)I'm repeating my request: Please try with a new profile. (You can backup your current profile, and put it in place after testing, so you won't lose any of your settings.)Can confirm this on 4.3.3.2 MacOSX.Created NEW profile with NEW user and performed the described steps. Results as described by Stamatis. (In reply to Stamatis from)So basically the issue now is with overwriting previously non-protected document, with a protected version? In that case it was kind of expected according to what I wrote in(that we don't remove old thumbnail if there's no new one). but I thought it will be only an issue when upgrading to the non-affected version, and I definitely didn't take into account this particular use-case. So I would like to know, how common is this scenario / how much is this annoying?I think, it isn't so uncommon. When writing a new document, i always emphasize my users to strictly save the document before printing. Once the (new) document is finished, the user decides if the content is confidential and password protected or not.The other point of view is: Shouldn't the thumbnail reflect the contents/layout of the document? In this case, i mean, the thumbnail must always be updated on closing/saving the document. At this point, password protection can be recognized and the thumbnail can be removed or simply updated as "confidental" or "secret" or something else. Or i'm wrong?I think that this scenario (retro-password protect an existing file) is quite common with users and I second the idea that once password is in place the thumbnail should become a generic one, independently of any previous instances.Maxim Monastirsky committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":Related: fdo#80755 Always update the thumbnailIt will be available in 4.4.0.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

id=80927	Problem description: Windows XP Pro SP3, LibreOffice 4.3.0.1 AND 4.3.0.2Despite of updating an existing version (4.2.5.2) or a clean install, LibreOffice works normally until I enable Quickstarter. With Quickstarter enabled â no matter if I try to open a document or simply try to start LibreOffice Start Center â the software crashes with no visible error message. Instead, it pops-up an empty frame which can only be dismissed via Windows Task Manager.Disabling Quickstarter allows LibreOffice to start again normally.Steps to reproduce:1. Start LibreOffice2. Enable Quickstarter and close Libreoffice leaving Quickstarter running3. Start LibreOffice againCurrent behavior: LibreOffice runs only if Quickstarter is disabledExpected behavior: LibreOffice running with Quickstarter enabled Operating System: Windows XPVersion: 4.3.0.2 rcLast worked in: 4.2.5.2 release hi, a few questions:1- did you experience the same issue in 4.3.0.1 as well?2- which exact steps you do to activate quickstarter?3- how did you disable quickstarter after the crash?Hi Tommy27,1 - I did experience de same issue in version 4.3.0.1.2 - To activate Quickstarter (because the option to activate during installation is ignored by the software): 2.1 - Tools > Options > LibreOffice > Memory > Load LibreOffice during system start-up3 - To disable I used the hardest way, I uninstalled the software and deleted all remaining traces by hand (folders, files and registry keys I was able to find) and then installed again. Probably I could simply erase the shortcut in my "Startup" folder, but I preferred do perform a clean install.I do not reproduce it with LibO 4.3.0.2 under Win7x64is there any other WinXP user who can test?I did experienced it with 4.3.0.2 in Windows 8.1 (64) environment. Had to uninstall the software and start over with a clean setup. I am not sure if I was able to have quickstarter installed with 4.3.0.1, but IÂ´m pretty sure I had trouble with it, and may be I disabled it. It definitely doesn.t work in the current release 4.3.0.2. The same happens on a machine running Windows 7.I use the spanish localized versiÃ³n of LibreOffice.By the way, if a new release is updated, the install option button does not have any effect on activating quickstarter. It has to be setup from the Tools | options | Memory menÃº as koenig.ralph explains. This is happening since a long time ago, perhaps from versiÃ³n 3. On the other hand, a completely clean installation allows the activation of quickstarter right from the install options.Hi, I reproduce with Win XP SP3, LibreOffice 4.3.0.2.Steps:1. Enable Quickstarter (tools-options-memory-Load LibreOffice during system start-up)2. Close libreoffice by clicking the "X" button. (program still running at backgound)3. Start libreoffice again.If you kill the libreoffice related process from system monitor, then LibreOffice can start up again, but if you close again you can not start it another time (you have to kill the process again to make it able to start.)With this bug, quickstarter do not work at all.Set to NEW.QuickStarter worked for me on windows in the previous versions, so REGRESSION.Bibisectrequest.do you have chance to test it over a Win7 machine?Tested and reproduced with LibreOffice 4.3.0.beta2, Windows 7 X86.It's even worse, killing the process or resetting user profile do not work.

All those, who try to tell you, that it's not needed anymore due to superfetch (windows Vista and higher) are wrong. Just take a stopwatch and try it, before telling such things!For me not having quickstart.exe is a complete showstopper, will revert back to 4.2.6_secfix.Completely agree. We user atom PC-s, and we r missing quickstart. Now it take 3-4x more times to start libre. Hope see QS soon.Anyone that can get a stack trace of the quickstarter crash, with debugging symbols - would make a large contribution to having the bug fixed =)Endless comments of the form "this feature is really important to me" combined with no activity at all around solving it are extremely counter-productive.(In reply to)How can I make it crash, when its not available??? Any way to get the quickstarter back? Its not available at install.

If it's a show stopper please consider: (1) submitting a patch, (2) finding someone that you know to submit a patch, or (3) wait for a VOLUNTEER to accept fixing the issue. This is a community, saying "this is a showstopper" doesn't inspire anyone to give their time literally for free. For people who use these kinds of words, I truly hope that you join one of our teams (not necessarily dev team) and contribute back to the community that gives tens of thousands of hours at no charge.If you're interested in QA (where we need more people quite bad) please contact me directly - it'll get you much further than going on bug reports and calling them "showstoppers"CreatedWinDBG Result of LibO 4.3.0.4 beeing unresponsive with Quickstart enabledGood Morning :)@Michael Meeks, Joel Madero and everyone else who felt me being "rude" or disrespectful yesterday: I'm very sorry, that my posts were received that way, that was not my intention. I absolutely have the highest respect of any LibO contributor and the spare-time many of them bring into the project.As requested by Michael Meeks, I just uploadet a WinDbg Result (don't know if this is what's called a stack trace?). I hope a developer can see more information in it then me, because to me it seems its missing any vital information. Problem is, that actually LibO is NOT crashing, but unresponsive. It uses almost no CPU Cycles, so I guess its waiting for something that's not happening.I also have memory dumps of soffice.bin (214MB) and soffice.exe (35MB) that were made with the hanging LibO. If this is of help to a developer, I can upload it to my ftp and share the URL with a developer over PM (don't want to make full memory-dumps public, due to privacy).CreatedWinDBG Result of LibO 4.3.0.4 beeing unresponsive with Quickstart enabledWinDBG Result of LibO 4.3.0.4 beeing unresponsive with Quickstart enabled.Hi there; thanks so much for the trace :-)So - this is tantelising =) you attached the debugger, got to the point that you could ask for a stack trace, and then continued ;-) you need to type:~* kAt least I think so by reading:Thanks !CreatedWinDBG Result of LibO 4.3.0.4 beeing unresponsive with Quickstart enabledHehe...

I tend to default to what I said just because we literally hear it every day. If you go through the few thousand bugs, at least 1 in 10 have someone screaming "this is a blocker! Fix it now!" or some such thing and . . . as you can imagine, it can become tiring/unmotivating/etc . . . reading it every day.BTW the offer still stands for you to join QA ;) We could use people with your skills (people who can follow instructions, do debugs, and write polite messages). Let me know if you have literally any free time and I'll help onboard you.That being said - thanks so much for going the extra step and helping us narrow down the problem. Moving this back to NEW@Michael - should we somehow get those large files from bugzilla2?@Joel Madero: Have you received my mail yesterday?I started to work on this, I have everything I need (Windows, debugger, reproduced problem, etc.). Let's see, if I can get anywhere with it...Thanks Andras - good luck :)So far, I bisected the problem, and it went wrong at:sfx: Use constructor feature for ShutdownIcon.At that time there were a lot commits like this, they looked like a mechanical conversions to me. Maybe this one contains a trivial error, that went in unnoticed. Maybe Stephan or Matus can see it quickly.Before this commit the quickstart icon appeared in systray, after this it did not, I only saw soffice.bin and soffice.exe in task manager. I think it is the root of the problem, quickstart component is not initialized properly.(In reply to Andras Timar from)Oh - great catch Andras, thanks!So, yes, it's wrong and somehow got unnoticed.I've tried to fix it in:(ignore that CR: -1)Could someone please verify if this works?Then we could try to fix that unit test.Matus, thanks for your patch!

Miklos chased this down and had this to say:<vmiklos> mmeeks: moment, i think i know what's the problem<vmiklos> mmeeks: so it seems word freezes if we put an anchored itage inside a textbox, even if the markup allows to do so; i changed the anchored duck to an inline one, and with that both LO and Word is happy with the docx, i updated it in SparkleShare.<vmiklos> mmeeks: if you can file a ticket for that, then later i think it would make sense to turn "anchored image in textbox" into "inline image in textbox" automatically on export, so that this works out of the box.I guess a gap between the spec. and the reality etc.My Word 2010 hangs in an infinite loop trying to load this .duckx.Createdduckness.(This is an automated message.)Setting priority to highest as this is a MAB. This is part of an effort to make the importance of MAB reflected in priority too.please retest with 4.3.x and 4.4.x and tell if a new duck file created with newer LibO releases still freezes MS Office.unfortunately I hav no MS Word to test.if bug persists please move this report to mab4.3 list since 4.2.x is end of lifemoreover was this really a mab4.2?I see the version was set to 4.4 alpha... so maybe it's a mab4.4please checkHey Michael -So I can confirm the issue with your file but if I open it with beta 2 and then save it as a new docx it opens fine.Am I missing something here or is it resolved? For now I am removing from 4.2 MAB (as it's end of life) and tossing this into NEEDINFO.If you can still confirm this issue with beta2 or master can you let us know how to create the file from scratch? Or attach an odt that we can save as docx to see the issue.Of course if it's still repro for you, we can toss it onto 4.4 mab (assuming it just popped up in 4.4 and not an earlier release, in which case 4.3 mab :) )Thanks!*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***
id=81113	The WebQuery function (Insert->Link to external data) does not work anymore.Steps to reproduce:1. New Calc;2. Insert - Link to external data3. Paste any one of the following links to the url field:...(any url which contains a table in it)4. Hit ENTER.Current Behaviour:Nothing happens.Expected Behaviour:Calc should load the webpage for a while, then a dialog pops up to ask you for import options, then available tables/ranges appear in the box.OS: Ubuntu 14.04 x86LibreOffice 4.3.0.2.It works in 4.2.5.2, -> Regression. WebQuery is a functionality that many people uses to fetch data from the web and import to calc.Hope this functionality come back in 4.3 soon.More info: WebQuery works as expected using macro in 4.3.0.2:sub myWebQuery dim document as object dim dispatcher as object document = ThisComponent.CurrentController.Frame dispatcher = createUnoService("com.sun.star.frame.DispatchHelper") dim args1(2) as new com.sun.star.beans.PropertyValue args1(0).Name = "FileName" args1(0).Value = "" args1(1).Name = "FilterName" args1(1).Value = "calc_HTML_WebQuery" args1(2).Name = "Source" args1(2).Value = "HTML_TABLES dispatcher.executeDispatch(document, ".uno:InsertExternalDataSource", "", 0,args1()) end subConfirmed it doesnt work in 4.3.1 and master, but works in 4.2.6.For this link:as provided in, it also does NOT work in LibreOffice 4.2.5.2 (when hit ENTER, no tables are shown in the "available tables/ranges" box).But it works in 3.6.7.2.However, in 4.2.5.2, all other links I tested works fine.So I keep the version as 4.3.0.2, and addas see also.Prioritizing:Critical - completely broken feature (although I think major would have been sufficient, I'll trust others judgment here :) )Highest - regression + 100% broken (mab)So I hope that this bibisect is correct - I based it on the import dialog coming up vs. nothing coming up withThat being said - with bibisect even waiting quite awhile I never saw tables come up (strange, no crash or anything, just hung, maybe had I waited longer it would have worked).ae44e45a06e1e642fc72b259e50e59837a9dda3f is the first bad commitcommit ae44e45a06e1e642fc72b259e50e59837a9dda3fAuthor: Bjoern Michaelsen <>Date: Sat May 10 21:04:53 2014 +0000 source-hash-004b403d75356e7184c24c6b51f8fef04171d3a1 commit 004b403d75356e7184c24c6b51f8fef04171d3a1 Author: Jan Holesovsky <> AuthorDate: Fri Dec 13 09:15:11 2013 +0100 Commit: Jan Holesovsky <> CommitDate: Fri Dec 13 13:01:28 2013 +0100 startcenter: Full thumbnail size (256px), upscale if necessary.

I don't think it's a show stopper, in fact there may be quite a few MABs in a .0 release. Nobody expects a perfect release. It is worth mentioning in the release notes that LibreOffice will not find its spellchecker dictionaries on Windows, and 4.3.1 will have a fix a month later.

As a fix exists, surely this is worth putting into an RC4 before public release.always think about first time users... people who's using LibO for the very first time... the first impact with a non functioning spellchecker which is a basic feature of any word processor could be detrimental for LibO reputation.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***For 4.3.0 see:ESC decided that there will be RC4 (at least on Windows, which is affected by the bug).Verified (on Windows 7 64-bit) withLibreOffice 4.3.0.4Build ID: 62ad5818884a2fc2e5780dd45466868d41009ec0.
id=81396	Open a spreadsheet and create two columns of data. Plot the data on a line chart. Annotate chart. Plot is visible and annotations including axis and grid settings are working. Save and close sheet. Re open sheet. When loaded the chart and data and grid and annotations are present but the plot is not visible on the grid. Only one point is visible and is the last data point on the columns of data. Using MS office open and save formats (xlsx in this case). Have not tried native format.Also picking a file to open from a file explorer list always opens the libra office file behind the file explorer window which is annoying.

Createdtest ods file with chartHi Tom,when I plot a line chart and save as XLSX, the plots are not missing, but the plot color are changed.Steps to observe:1. Save the attached ods file to XLSX.So: please confirm whether the plots are missing, or the plots color are changed (to white?) so that you can not see them.#1Open test chart.ods file.Plot shows diamonds as orange and squares as dark blue.Save as MS XLSx.Open xlsx file and plots are rendered in light blue for both plots not orange and dark blue as before.#2Open Test chart.ods file.Change plot to connect dots.Save as ms xlsx. Won't let me save. xlsx and other forms not on pick list. Had to save ods, close ods and reopen then save to xlsx.Open xlsx file and find no change to plots. Colors as in ods and dots connected.In my file I am plotting one column of data against another column not against the cell number as you show in the test file. In my case the plot is gone except for one dot which is the last data point in the two columns. I moved the mouse around hoping to hit another data point in case it was white but no go. Opening the data series format dialog shows the original dark blue color so it has not changed. There seem to be several bugs causing multiple but similar behavior.-Tom S.On 7/15/2014 9:32 PM,wrote:>>>>>>Tom, please attache an (ods) file from which we can reproduce the data series lost issue.

Based on his file, I can now confirm this critical bug.Steps to reproduce:1. Save the attached test ods file as xlsx;2. Reopen the xlsx file in libreoffice.Current Behaviour:All plots are not shown, except the one plot which has no formula in it's cell.A CTRL+SHIFT+F9 will bring all plots back again.The exported xlsx file opens fine in MSO 2010, so this is an XLSX IMPORT problem.This affects all chart types.Reproducibe with:Version: 4.3.1.0.0+, Build ID: 5536b127a105123de6f64dcf8f53dfa277faef3c, TinderBox: Win-x86@42, Branch:libreoffice-4-3, Time: 2014-07-16_10:15:31and 4.2.6.1, Build ID: 5fdddf655fba363e34f755715238d0943a44857eWindows XP SP3.The exported xlsx file opens file in Apache OpenOffice 4.2.

Perhaps not a regression.Tested under Ubuntu 12.04 x86With 4.2.5.2 changing the option in:Menu/Tools/Options/LibreOffice calc/Formula - Recalculation on file load Excel 2077 and newer to always recalculate, do the job.Works for me with:Win7x64Version: 4.4.0.0.alpha0+ Build ID: 32551a546c83874f08aba9c0adb7a38230fa2e36 TinderBox: Win-x86@39, Branch:master, Time: 2014-07-19_07:47:52I think this option was implemented to reduce the loading time with large files. Hard recalc is an usual action in calc, in fact some functions need it to be recalculated.OTH, It's not too much clear for me why this one is in MAB, I think we need to be more strict about that, not the first developer commenting about he doesn't take too much care on MABs. I think the problem now is how to find the patch to ask the dev for backport at least to 4.3Yes if we set "Always Recalculate" to Excel 2007 and newer, it works as expected.Confirmed in 4.3.0.3 and 4.2.6.1But I think not many users know about this, maybe some notice in release notes or documentation would be helpful to many users.(In reply to)Yes this is true, but it's only a workaround.I am not sure what you mean by "works for me". Does the chart loaded with all plots shown correctly when you open with 4.4.0.0.alpha0+?I tried with 4.4.0.0.alpha0+ TinderBox: Win-x86@42, Branch:master, Time: 2014-07-21_06:04:54, it's the same bug behaviour.Under "Menu/Tools/Options/LibreOffice calc/Formula - Recalculation on file load", it's also set as "Never" for ODS format, but chart loads OK in ODS file.I think it may be related.It's OK to implement sth to speedup the loading of xlsx file, but should make sure that what we see are corroct. (For this case, the chart shown is totally wrong!)As a normal user, they should never know this. I even do not know the "CTRL+SHIFT+F9" feature before I come to bugzilla and find it in the bug reports in which someone tells to "Hard Recalc". Also, Hald Recalc is not on the UI "Tools - Cell Contents". What a normal user may find is to use the "Recalculate" submenu, but that does not solve the problem.Just like Tom S. who reported this bug, he did not find the reason why his chart is showing only one plot. He must have tried his best to find a solution, but did not find it. I then got his test file, and spent 2 hours and finally find out the reason.If his speadsheet has formulas in all the cells, there would be not even one plot shown, which will be even harder to find the reason. See also this one in our Chinese libreoffice discuss forum:It's still reproducible in daily builds, so no patch.(In reply to)I mean, this "XLSX: always recalculate" option is not selected by default in a fresh user profile.By defalut, "ODS" is also set to "Never recalculate", but shows correct chart when load.CreatedConfiguration that makes it works. registrymodifications.xcuInvestigating a bit, I have found that with 4.4 works for me with the attached configuration file (in the root profile directory), and with a resetting of the user profile not without change the option or with a hard recalc.But I'm not able to find which option is different in Menu/Tools/Options with this file, perhaps a hidden option makes the difference.Maybe someone is able to find what it's the option making the difference with the attached file.still reproducible under Win8.1 using 4.5.0.0.alpha0+Build ID: 84a6d8eeaab540e5b2ea3baffd919903dff8c247TinderBox: Win-x86@39, Branch:master, Time: 2014-11-22_23:41:04Locale: it_ITmoving to mab4.3 list since 4.2.x is end of lifeMost likely the fix inis correct.

id=81806	CreatedWriter document which demonstrates the crashPaste/undo actions in tables with merged cells cause document corruption and crashesObserved on OSX with LO 4.2.5.2. Other platforms unknownSteps to reproduce1. Load the attached Writer document(which contains a 3x3 table in which A2:A3 and B2:C2 are merged cells, and the letters "a" "b" and "c" are placed in cells C1, B2 and C3 respectively)2. Select and cut the range C1:C3 (the three cells containing the "a" "b" and "c")3. Place the cursor in cell B24. Repeatedly paste then undoResultDespite the fact that the selection is unchanged, and the cursor is not moved, the three charaters are placed differently in each paste-undo cycle. After a couple of cycles, the table structure is corrupted and LO crashes CreatedCrash dumpStill occurs in 4.3.0.4 releaseDear Matthew,Thank you for submitting the bug. I can confirm that the bug is available in 3.3.0, 3.6.7, 4.2.5, and 4.3.1. It will crash between 2 to 4 paste and undo cycles.Createdlinux backtrace(This is an automated message.)LibreOffice development currently prioritizes bugs with the so called MAB (most annoying bugs) -- as this bug has not run through that process (including writing a short rationale for this bug being a candidate and other who are watching the tracker bug silently approving that rationale etc.) its priority is set to high. Note this is effectively no change in the urgency assigned to this bug, as we are currently not making a difference between high and highest and severity is untouched.You can find out more about MABs and how the process works by contacting libreoffice qa on irc:The QA wiki page also gives you hints on how to get in contact with the team (if IRC fails you, your next best choice is the mailing list):CreatedLinux dbg bt of TB45 dbg build with symbols and source refsBacktrace with recent 32-bit Linux TB45-debug buildOn Fedora 20, 32-bit en-US with debug buildVersion: 4.4.0.0.alpha1+Build ID: d59b9b4af36148e4d8df8f3e3492116d378642e2TinderBox: Linux-rpm_deb-x86@45-TDF-dbg, Branch:master, Time: 2014-11-06_03:11:43SIGABRT crash, assertion while finding pointer positionpBlock->pData[ nOffset...

This is part of an effort to make the importance of MAB reflected in priority too.issue remains with 4.3 and 4.4 builds. Moving to mab4.3try that with the correct bug id for mab4.3What I see is that undo always leaves a pam that points to the start of the undone area and a mark to the end of the undone area, even if that area is empty. (In the normal where there is a selection this can be seen by selecting something, deleting it, and undoing and the newly undeleted stuff is again selected)The table overwrite/paste thing looks to see if a mark is set and goes off to "do something very complex" if its set. So if after each undo cycle, you physically click at the point where the cursor is flashing (which clears the mark) and then paste, undo, *click*, paste you get a wonderfully stable experience.So it seems reasonable to me to "do the simple thing" if there is no mark, or if the mark and point are the same, i.e. there is nothing actually selected by the PaM.CaolÃ¡n McNamara committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":Resolves: tdf#81806 crash on certain table paste+undo+page cyclesIt will be available in 5.1.0.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

To use LibreOffice 4.2.6 I did a full uninstall of previous LibreOffice 4.1.6 with Revo Uninstaller and I cleaned the registry of bad entries with CCleaner. Then I deleted the entire LibreOffice folder of Program Files (if exist) and the folder Libreoffice on \Documents and Setting\<user name>\Application Data\libreoffice.I do a custom install of LibreOffice 4.2.6 only with Spanish user interface and spanish dictionary the rest of the elements are disabled. When the installation finish I run Writer, it start windowed, and LibreOffice creates its own LibreOffice folder (this is the default profile that I referred) on \Documents and Setting\<user name>\Application Data\ with default options after installation.Every works properly but when I'm going to save my document the Save as... window appears as in the image attached. No options under Name, the save and cancel button does not respond, I can only close that window by clicking the x in the upper right corner.If I uninstall version 4.2.6 and install the 4.1.6 whit same custom install options everything works correctly.CreatedSame problems opening somethingI tried doing a fresh FULL install of LibreOffice 4.2.6, not only I can not save a document but I can not open or export, I have the same problem. I did not realize before because I just tried to write something and save it.Again if I go back to version 4.1.6 I have no problem. I will try to install it on another PC and if the problem disappears I have to stay with version 4.1.6. I've been using LibreOffice since it was born and so far I have not had any problem with it.

Please help! They can't work with LO now!@Kelvin: I'm able to reproduce this with 4.3.0.4 but not with 4.3.1.0.0+ from 2014-08-02_22:03:26, so I'm closing this bug as WORKSFORME. I suspect it's related towhich was fixed recently. Please test with a recent dev build, and feel free to reopen the bug in case it didn't fix your problem (preferably set the status to UNCONFIRMED).@Stephan: Your Java code works perfectly for me with 4.3.0.4 under Fedora 20. Anyway it doesn't seem to be related to the original bug, so if you still have this problem please open a separate report. Thanks!Hi Maxim, I tested it only with Windows. I will download the latest nightly build and if that won't work, I check it on Linux. ThxI installed nightly build from 2nd August 4.3.1.0.0 on my Windows Machine and it works! I uninstalled this version and tried the current release 4.3.0.4 and it fails again! There is definitly a bug in the current version.I (and my users) can wait for 4.3.1 release - everything is fine for me!

id=81233	I just lost a document to the Cut / Paste feature not working after closing Libre Office Writer 4.2.5 RC2.In LibreOffice Writer hit Ctrl+X on some text, close the program and then attempt to paste to Google Docs or another program.My clipboard is cleared. If I didn't save my document (which I didn't) - my text in the clipboard is completly wiped out.This is a _extreemly_ critical bug for _all_ users as it diminishes functionality. Dear elecricprism,Thank you for reporting. This is a problem with the Linux clipboard system and has been reported before and its hoped that it will be fixed.*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***May I suggest that LO checks whether the Linux Clipboard is in use and if so displays a warning message on exit as this is the standard for other office suites?Something like:"There is text stored in the clipboard, this text will be deleted once Libre Writer is closed, do you want to continue?"[Yes] [No]Hi elecricprism,This is a linux problem that we hope libreoffice will decide to use a workaround to fix for its linux users. This problem effects all linux applications, which is why its recommended to use a clipboard manager like parcellite to solve it for all apps.

Did your crash really happen in Writer?(2) How do you drag a cell with the mouse? All I can accomplish is to extend the selection, in both Writer and Calc.You know what to do with bug status.Thanks,Terry.Hi Terry,Thats my mistake, its calc. In order to drag a cell, select the cells you want to drag, and then the next time you click on the selected cells, you will be able to drag it.Hi Jay.. I can't reproduce crash with LO 4.3.1.2 and 4.2.6.2 portable under Win7 x86Have you tried resetting user profile?(In reply to)Sorry..it's 4.2.6.3Though libO crashing due to the profile is still a bug, i reset it just for the fun of it and it still crashes.

Ishall look for a partition with an intermediate version of ubuntuwhich will run the bibisect-43all versions.Just for completeness, here is how to drag a cell:(*) Click in the cell and hold the mouse button down. There is little visible result.(*) Drag the mouse to another cell and continue to hold the mouse button down. The program shades a rectangle of cells as selected.(*) Drag the mous back to the original cell. The program highlights just the original cell as selected.(*) Release the mouse button. The original cell is still selected.(*) Click in the original cell and drag it where you want it to be.Can someone check if this commithas fixed this crasher?In the daily dbgutil bibisect, the crash disappears between theversions of 2014-09-02 and 2094-09-03. So, I can readily believe thatis that commit that fixed it.Please ignore my earlier comment about different versions of systemlibraries.Terry.Terry, thanks for checking. The same commit has been backported to both 4.2 and 4.3 branches.

Conclusion ***The font represantion of LibreOffice Mac differs from LibreOffice Windows as well as both differ from NeoOffice. Thus documents created with LibreOffice Mac can neither be used with LibreOffice Windows nor with NeoOffice and vice versa. The font handling of all three programs is incompatible. Additional informtion:*** LibreOffice 4.3.2.2 Mac â Slovene language ***stores the font name in a way, that is either incompable with the windows version of LibO or even loses formatting**** .odt ****uses a broken name, that contains a combination of the family-name + the number "1" and the font-adornment "Svetlo", which is the slovene UI-translation for "Light"<style:font-face style:name="Akzidenz-Grotesk Pro1" svg:font-family="&apos;Akzidenz-Grotesk Pro&apos;" style:font-adornments="Svetlo" style:font-pitch="variable"/>**** .rtf ****uses only the family-name. when saved and opened again it falls back from light to regular style, because the style-information is lost{\f5\fnil\fprq0\fcharset0 Akzidenz-Grotesk Pro;}{\f6\fnil\fprq2\fcharset0 Akzidenz-Grotesk Pro;}*** LibreOffice 4.3.1.2 Windows â German language ***uses the full-name**** .odt ****<style:font-face style:name="Akzidenz-Grotesk Pro Light" svg:font-family="&apos;Akzidenz-Grotesk Pro Light&apos;" style:font-adornments="Light" style:font-family-generic="modern" style:font-pitch="variable"/>*** NeoOffice 3.4.1 â English language ***using the full-name**** .odt ****<style:font-face style:name="Akzidenz-Grotesk Pro Light" svg:font-family="&apos;Akzidenz-Grotesk Pro Light&apos;" style:font-family-generic="swiss" style:font-pitch="variable"/>*** Microsoft Word 2008 for Mac ***both, DOCX and RTF, are usisng the full-name**** .docx ****<w:rFonts w:ascii="Akzidenz-Grotesk Pro Light" w:hAnsi="Akzidenz-Grotesk Pro Light"/>**** .rtf ***uses the full-name but show also documents using the postscript-name properly:{\f35\fbidi \fnil\fcharset0\fprq2{\*\panose 02000506040000020003}Akzidenz-Grotesk Pro Light;}*** Apple Pages PagesÂ´09 Version 4.3 (1048) ***uses the postscript-name<sf:fontName><sf:string sfa:string="AkzidenzGroteskPro-Light"/></sf:fontName>*** Bean Version 3.2.5 ***uses either the full-name or the postscript-name**** .odt ****uses the full-name<style:font-face style:name="Akzidenz-Grotesk Pro Light" svg:font-family="Akzidenz-Grotesk Pro Light"/>**** .rtf ****although using the postscript-name compatible with Microsoft Word 2008 for Mac, thus shows also documents using the full-name properly:{\fonttbl\f0\fnil\fcharset0 AkzidenzGroteskPro-Light;}Proposed solution:As NeoOffice does it the right way and is compatible with LibreOffice for Windows, copy the font handling code from NeoOffe 3.4.1 (should be GPL).Temporary solution for Mac users:Use NeoOffice instead of LibreOffice, until the problem with LibreOffice is solved.Additional information:Both, LibreOffice Windows and NeoOffice, do recognize and correctly handle postscript-names given in an ODT-file:<style:font-face style:name="AkzidenzGroteskPro-Light" svg:font-family="AkzidenzGroteskPro-Light"/><style:text-properties style:font-name="AkzidenzGroteskPro-Light"/>LibreOffice Mac doesn't and shows replacement Fonts einstead.No independent confirmation, setting status back to unconfirmed.Please, don't set your onw bugs as NEW.Best regards. JBFIs there no freely available version of this font family ? Otherwise, it is going to be hard to reproduce.@sarutat : please check the other OTF/font issues affecting Mac versions of LO via bugzilla, this one might well be a duplicate.As for using NeoOffice code, it would have to be LGPL3/MPL in order to be acceptable for the LO codebase - if it is just GPL, it won't be accepted.Dear Bug Submitter,This bug has been in NEEDINFO status with no change for at least6 months.

id=85128	CreatedThe file referred to in the descriptionIn the attached file there are three sheets with tables. Impress consistently crashes when selecting one of these tables and do a ctr-C.I find Impress to be very unstable. I encountered a lot of crashes. Not only this problem (which I submit because it is consistent and therefor repeatable) but also when simply working with objects and text blocks. This morning I was working for a few hours and had at least a dozen chrashes. Saving insanely frequent does improe this slightly.I will try the still again and if I encounter the same behaviour I am very sorry to say that I see no other option than to buy M$ Office... :-( I'm back on the still version (4.2.6.3) and I am very happy to say that the consistent crashing does not appear in this version. I will continue using Impress (intensively) and will report again if crashed start te reappear.By the way, thanks for al the great work. Although being a bit put off by the problems experienced, I am really glad to be able to continue working with LO.CreatedWindbg info (no reproduce, EH exception)I do not reproduce the crash in Win7 X64, LibreOffice 4.3.3.1Build ID: 7d55112667c8fcddb67bc3803796b46c93aa56b0However, during debuging, every time I was trying to select a table, I got the following:(ef4.a48): C++ EH exception - code e06d7363 (first chance)@ E Moen:If you have time, please follow the instructions here to attach a backtrace:This is very helpful for devs to solve this issue.

MoenCreatedBacktrace when copying the tableCreatedBacktrace copying some stuff and editing it until crashHello,Done some backtracking, resulting in two files: BT1 and BT2.BT1This is the analysis of the table copying problem.BT2This is another analysis of a crash that I also found to happen almost certain. What I did was: copying some objects (squares, arrows and some text) from one file to the other (both files obviously opened) and after that, some random editing (make squares smaller, move some text, rearrange an arrow etc.). After something like 10 to 15 of these actions Impress crashed. I have seen this happening a lot.Hope this helps.Cheers,EgbertSet to NEW as there is backtrace with symbles.@Meon: If you have time please test with version 4.3.3 RC1. There are chances this issue is fixed in this version.CreatedBacktrack table copy problem on 4.3.3 RC1Hi,Done a backtrack on 4.3.3 RC1. Ihm afraid the problem is still there. Details in the attached BT3 file.Cheers,EgbertCreatedBacktrace on Kubuntu 14.04, with LO 4.3.3.2I'm having the same problem on Kubuntu 14.04 with LO 4.3.3.2. Just uploaded the backtrace, let me know if you need an example file, or anything else that would be helpful.I get the crash copying slides that contain a table, not just copying a table. Dragging and dropping works fine.Createdbt with debug symbolsOn pc Debian x86-64 with 4.3 sources updated today, I could reproduce the crash.But I don't reproduce the crash with master sources (future 4.4.0) updated yesterday.E Moen: I compared with fdo#85113 and there's the same bt + both seem ok with master sources. Could you tell if your tables were previously animated?No. No previous animation. Interesting fact: as I had to proceed with this presentation so as a work around I used Open Office (sorry for that). Although sluggish, OO did not crash on me when copying the tables.Have you tested with a fresh profile?.If not please do so.Also this is not a blocker - please do not revert the change as blockers have a very particular meaning and this does not meet that criteria.Setting to:Critical - routine crashes with backtraceHighest - going to add this to MAB as it's a consistent crash that results in loss of data.Thanks!Some time ago I did try working with a clean profile. I did not make any difference.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***I was having the same problem in Mac OS X.

How long should any single developer be allowed to break master? We're going on a week now. A month, a year? Your blog is about demands. I did not demand. I made a suggestion with a "please" saying IF they did not "have a fix in the pipeline". How is this unreasonable? I have now reproduced this bug on a Win 8 laptop, Win 7 desktop, and Ubuntu 14.10 desktop. In addition, it seems this bug is reproducible by everyone here once they started using builds after 10/10, except oddly the commiter.And by the way, this includes you.

The row and column headings expand and the heavy outline of cell D3 expands and moves to stay aligned with the headings. The rest of the data area is not resized; without that rezising the data area still shows fragments of the cell-selection-box from smaller zoom factors. The cell borders from the smaller zoom factor are visible within the resized cell-selection-box of cell D3.(4) Another "+" in the zoom control increases the zoom factor to 100%. The data area looks good in every respect.(5) Another "+" in the zoom control increases the zoom factor to 110%. Again, the row and column headers expand, and the cell-selection-box is positioned and sized in accord with the new zoom factor. The rest of the data area remains at 100%, and it shows a fragment of the cell-selection-box as it was at 100%.(6) I dragged the About box around and closed it. Unlike the result that Stuart reports in, the data area was unchanged.When I changed the desktop area to 800 x 600 and then to 1024 by 768,results are unchanged.With the daily dbgutil bibisect version 2014-10-22, which is of course64-bit, I of course see no rendering artifacts.

I can now get back to triaging bug reports.(In reply to Joey Reid from)No, quite the contrary--the decision to revert was the ESC's, the issue is not "fixed" and if anything an apology is due to David T. and Juan P. from the community for not hanging in there while the issues with the refactoring were resolved.The boost::rational refactoring for Fraction is a nice piece of code--it just needs a bit more work and review to make it right on 32-bit implementations. It is no different than the work Kohei did with the calc refactoring at 4.3--just a little more apparent to users of 32-bit builds.The price of QA and early adopters being intolerant of regressions caused by substantive rework of the code in master is stagnation of the project, and discouragement of talented developers to attempt any of the many things that could be improved in the code.I have no doubt that given a few more build cycles, the regression would have been resolved--and we'd have the Fraction structures implemented with more robust boost::rational methods. That is a shame.Stuart***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Migrating Whiteboard tags to Keywords: (bibisected)[NinjaEdit]

Test to see if it's because I'm using a Secondary partition, installed in user titled folder. unistall 4.3.2 and install 4.3.3then tell if it fix thingsThe software has issues when installed on a secondary partition, the issue consists of the folder pertaining to my name and in this folder was the libre office installed. It seems there may be restrictions being imposed in the software preventing it from functioning in a folder with someone's name. Example: D:/Myrealname/LibreOffice4/I use other softwares in the folder, there are no Computer security rights restrictions regarding the folder and drive. There may be issues with the factor of an anti-hack measure for DOS coding i use. Example: #^@%:/MyRealname/LibreOffice4 #^@% is the name I gave the Hardrive or partition. All other software's function properly except LibreOffice. I re-installed the LibreOffice on the OS hardrive Partion, it began to function.The OS drive partition use a similar name,Example: C:/Program Files/Libre Office4/it is $%&^*:PRogram Files/Libre Office4/The Libre Office Help File will not work on another partion other than The OS drive PArtition. All in all it is working now. It would be nice if the software were able to function on the second partition, in the folder Which is my name, for copyright purposes. Thank you for your assistance any how.The Idea was to have every File Created to have the Administrator privileges and rights coding in file creation in my name for every file I type using Libre Office. Which means because the Libre Office is installed in a folder with my name it will also put the program's instalation folder information in the Key file link layer docet.If you notice when you open administrator setting each Windows comes with a code serial which translates to the Computer User name. I want that code come through Libre Office on every file I create in the Core kernel of the Libre office file. Not even if they hack the file they can't say it's their own and Libre Office can clain rights on premises to protect client user reputation on file in any legal matter.Computer forensics will identify the file as a Client user document of Libre Office with the client's name.

id=86216	CreatedVery small spreadsheet that demonstrates BUG 2Quite simply, for my spreadsheet, SORT on LibreOffice CALC (4.1 something) that shipped with Ubuntu 12.04 worked, and version 4.2.7.2 does not. I have tested it again on my Ubuntu 12.04 machine and the same operations work properly. I have included an example spreadsheet with only 6 cells of data that demonstrates BUG 2.Potential for Work AroundsIt is not convenient to use only my 12.04 machine, it is at a different geographical location. It is not convenient to downgrade my 14.04 machine to 12.04, it is a touch screen laptop and 12.04 does not give me functionality. Attempts to just downgrade LibreOffice have not been readily successful. Background: Size of my SpreadsheetMy spreadsheet is very large (12 tabs, 2500+ rows in one tab, columns up to W and Z used in two tabs), however, 4.2.7.2 cannot handle sorting even a fraction of it, where 4.1-something can still sort it. The spreadsheet saves as 1.7M in size. BUG 1: Crashes when trying to Sort:If I try to sort 2582 (actually anything more than about 1/3 of that) rows of data spread across columns A-W by column C and D, or D and C, LibreOffice 4.2.7.2 crashes outright. That was really irritating. This problem has existed since I installed 14.04 on a new machine, 4-5 months ago. I have been using filters on column C to avoid sorting as a band-aid, waiting for someone to recognize they broke it, and fix it. BUG 2: Not correctly re-referencing formuli after the sortToday I discovered another problem. LibreOffice 4.2.7.2 is mangling smaller sorts. I have about 100 rows of data in columns A to W. Column A is text. Column B is a formula that does string manipulations on A to convert one style of label to another style of label. (The labels in column A took on form historically and changed form in 2010. Column B redoes labels into a numerical number. Old labels are rendered into a number that makes them sort properly with numbers from the new style. The labels are job numbers.) The formuli in B6 is: =IF(A6="","",IF(MID(A6,7,1)=".",VALUE(MID(A6,2,7)),VALUE(MID(A6,3,1))*1000+VALUE(MID(A6,4,3))+VALUE(MID(A6,2,1))/10))Nothing terribly bizzare, and, certainly not illegal in any way. If I highlight the block A6-A8, and sort by column B ascending, then the data in column A (no formuli) is in proper order (like it remembered HOW to sort by B), but the formula in B6 is now:=IF(A8="","",IF(MID(A8,7,1)=".",VALUE(MID(A8,2,7)),VALUE(MID(A8,3,1))*1000+VALUE(MID(A8,4,3))+VALUE(MID(A8,2,1))/10))the cell numbers in formuli are not being properly preserved to refer to the data they were originally referring to in its NEW location. They are now referring to where the data was. The data in A6 was in A8 before the sort. When it was moved from A8 to A6 in the sort, the references in the formuli in the matching rows was not changed from A8 to A6. Other cells in the rows being sorted do refer to other tabs of the sheet, and use functions like SUMIF and INDEX and MATCH to get all the data referring to one job in one row. All these formuli are mucked up in exactly the same manner at column B formuli, but, they are way more complicated and a complete formuli and all dependent data cannot be pasted here as easily as the formula for column B. In my sheet, in a given column, some rows have formuli dependent on other cells or tabs, some have constants or strings. Editing the formuli to be correct on the top row and copying them down will erase the constants and strings and replace them with formuli that result in different data than existed before the sort. This goes to the very heart of what a sort is. If one does not notice it mucking up, years of work can be mangled beyond repair. Fortunately an assistant mangled this sheet once before years ago by failing to sort all columns, I managed to repair it and since then I have paranoidly saved the file with a new version number every time I save it. I was able to go back, but this is not allowing me to go forward. Attached is a small paste from my spreadsheet, a sheet with only A6-B8 in it (same formuli as above). This is what it looks like to me before shorting by B ascending:S14004.1 14004.1S12082.1 12082.1S12015.4 12015.4This is what is looks like after sorting by B ascending:S12015.4 14004.1S12082.1 12082.1S14004.1 12015.4This is obviously wrong. Please contact me atif there is some default setting of 4.2.7.2 that makes its sorts completely different than every spreadsheet program that went before it that I can correct and make it sort the way every earlier spreadsheet program sorted. Edits:edit one:(The labels in column A took ONE form historically and changed form in 2010. Column B redoes labels into a numerical number. Old labels are rendered into a number that makes them sort properly with numbers from the new style. The labels are job numbers.)edit two:Nothing terribly bizzare, and, certainly not illegal in any way. If I highlight the block A6-A8, and sort by column B ascending, then the data in column A (no formuli) is in proper order (like it remembered HOW to sort by B), but the formula in B6 is now:obviously should read:Nothing terribly bizzare, and, certainly not illegal in any way. If I highlight the block A6-B8, and sort by column B ascending, then the data in column A (no formuli) is in proper order (like it remembered HOW to sort by B), but the formula in B6 is now:(In reply to m_j_malone from)Hiya,Sorry to hear that you're experiencing a regression (and crash) in LibreOffice.Given that the 4.2 line just had its last release, could you please verify your results in our (newer) 4.3 branch? Thanks!Please attach an example of a spreadsheet that demonstrates this problem. (If the file is too large to attach, please try compressing it. If it's still too big, leave a note and we'll get the file another way :-)This sounds like it could be a separate bug. Please file a new bug report for it.Thanks!Once you've attached the example spreadsheet (and hopefully filed #2 as a new bug report), please change the status back to 'UNCONFIRMED'.Thanks!Status -> NEEDINFOHow about you just forget Bug1 and answer Bug2? I cannot post that spreadsheet, it is propriety and I did post a spreadsheet for bug 2. I have no time to go through the hassle of downloading 4.3 and testing it. I downgraded to a version that works. When Ubuntu comes out with a new long term service release, I might upgrade, if I have the time. Right now I am kind of busy fixing my mangled spreadsheets. I see bug #2 hit the news already.Too bad LibreOffice did not warn me in a really obvious way that they changed something so fundamental and standardized across other spreadsheets before the sorting mangled my spreadsheet.(In reply to m_j_malone from)We've got literally thousands of bug reports filed against LibreOffice. We're trying to go through them as quickly and efficiently as possible, so please help us out by filing just one bug per report.It's really hard for us to track down a crash or a performance problem without having the ability to reproduce the problem ourselves. This page can help you remove any proprietary information from your document before you post it:LibreOffice 4.2 will reach End of Life in 1 week:...at that point we'll need someone to reproduce this bug using a modern build of LibreOffice (either 4.3 or a pre-release/dev build of 4.4). That helps us to confirm that the problem still exists in versions we're currently shipping.Upgrading is totally up to you. If you upgrade, you can help us identify if the crashing problem still exists, which in turn will allow us to improve LibreOffice not just for you, but for everyone. I think it's a clear win-win situation for both of us.Your test file is corrupted or faulty, when I open it with LO 4.2.6 or LO 4.4.0.0.alpha2 I get Err:502 in B1:B3. If it is the result of the sorting, please attach alse the test file in its state before sorting.Set status to NEEDINFO. Please set it back to UNCONFIRMED once you have provided requested informations. Thank you for your understanding.Best regards. JBFHere is a second, even simpler spreadsheet that 4.2.7.2 cannot sort properly. Ask it to sort by column B ascending with A1-B2 as the range. As for the process described for altering a spreadsheet to remove confidential data, I have examined it. The process would not remove the uniqueness of the numbers of the spreadsheet. I might recommend that LO add a 2 functions to anonymize data in a range. The first function goes through each cell in the defined range. It examines the contents and replaces it and all identical occurences of that data (either numerical or text) with a random equivalent everywhere in all tabs of the spreadsheet. For occurrences found within the defined range, they are marked as "done" and are not doubly randomized. Text becomes random text of similar length. Numbers become random numbers (never zero) of similar parameters. So $5.45 becomes $10.71, but never 6.024E24 for instance. The second function does not make global searches and replaces, the data in each cell is just replaced with random data of similar nature. Therefore two occurences of $5.45 become different amounts. One might then randomize a spreadsheet with little manual labour while maintaining the action of MATCH and SUMIF operations. If the linking of these functions were not preserved in the randomization of my spreadsheet, it would completely change the nature of sorting it. However, someone will no doubt point out there is some other archane system for making suggestions.Returning to the problem of 4.2.7.2 not sorting correctly, In this reference:Lukebenes reportedly supplied a spreadsheet that 4.2.7 could not sort properly (the same way 4.2.6 did) with either setting of the secret setting. Luke (lukebenes) wrote (in part) on 2014-11-11: ...To be clear, with 4.2.7 there is no way to return to the old style sorting routine. Some spreadsheets that worked fine in Excel and 4.26 require UpdateRefs=True, while others require it to be false. Others are broken with either UpdateRefs setting because of bugs introduced in this new sorting routine. Is it any wonder users are confused?I recommend taking his sample spreadsheets from that thread test_offset.ods and Calc bug.ods and verify those. This matter is so urgent, I hope someone can use a little imagination and use these sources in other bug reports as tests.CreatedEven smaller file that sorting A1-B2 by column B ascending fails in 4.2.7.2Jean-Baptiste Faure, you are the same person who proposed the preposterous:That lead to all the problems and mangled my spreadsheet and many others. I do not consider you either sufficiently knowledgeable because of all the damage you have cause, nor sufficiently independent to resolve this bug. I ask that you recuse yourself from this matter. Before you go citing what various other programs promised to do with sorting, like you do here:And attack what Microsoft has written, you should know, I do not care what any other spreadsheet program developer wrote. I want 4.2.7.2 to work like 3.5 did on Ubuntu 12.04 (yes, that is a correction) because this was compatible with what Excel did. I have been told 4.2.6 is compatible with Excel also. I have downgraded to 4.1.6.2 and it behaves as Excel did. Anything that you change that makes LibreOffice incompatible with what previous versions, and other spreadsheet programs DID and leads to mangling of spreadsheets is not an enhancement, it is breaking it.(In reply to m_j_malone from)Please, explain. I reportedto show that the fix forintroduced a regression when sorting spreadsheets like.Best regards. JBFEnd the mangling that is going on right now out there in the field. That should be the #1 priority. The priority should NOT be polishing FRESH and STILL and discussing obscurities and poorly composed spreadsheets that never would have worked with a cut and paste hand-sort model of what sort is conceptually. You cannot make every stupid use of links work in every case with sort without violating the concept of what a sort is. Again, if you want something that is not a cut-and-paste model sort of records, create a new button called MANGLE for it so there is no confusion. Call it the mangle enhancement. So it appears Kohei Yoshida introduced a bug in some obscure use to correct for some badly written sheet. Then after discussion with you, and with your cooperation introduced another bug and a secret option that does not work properly (like other spreadsheet programs) in either setting. This was then pushed out to existing working versions, with your assistance and cooperation. Even after being shown proof, you defended this noconforming behaviour as an enhancement. And I have yet to see any unequivocally statement that all traces of this debacle have been withdrawn from 4.2.7.2 -- the first and the second change so that 4.2.7.2 works as previous versions and other spreadsheets do. I hear what others have said, that it is not possible, now that the bad code is in 4.2.7.2, only creating an upgrade version without any of this bad code in it, 4.2.8 for instance, will solve this problem. And you seem completely oblivious to the users out there STILL using a mangling version of 4.2.7.2 (because that is what was delivered with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) who STILL have not noticed they are mangling their old spreadsheets every time they have sorted them. What is the plan to stop the mangling that is going on right now ? If 4.2.6.2 is absent of any trace of this foolishness, then why did someone not copy it to a new directory called 4.2.8 and trigger an update of all 4.2.7.2 to code that works like other spreadsheets do ? End the mangling, that should be priority #1, not this overly detail oriented discussion referencing bug reports. WIND IT BACK. Do it now. Why was that not done several days ago? Today is Friday, a lot of people have automated backups that run on the weekend. Their hope to retrieve a non-mangled version of their years-old spreadsheet might be gone by Monday. Oh, oh, is the excuse going to be that this is free software, all software has bugs, we are just volunteers ? How long would it take to copy all of 4.2.6.2 (or whatever works like other spreadsheets do, and earlier versions of LibreOffice did) to 4.2.8 and save people years of pain. To me it seems so easily done that it would be like not helping an old lady up off the sidewalk. You just have no concept of how valuable old spreadsheets are to people, even when told, over days, over several threads, bug reports. I want to hear in all these threads, an unequivocal statement, all of this foolishness has been completely extracted from the code and will never appear in any future version. So now some plain-English questions you might be able to answer. I do not want to hear any more euphemisms like regression or gobbledy-gook about current, fresh, whatever, or citations to other bug reports that are just as difficult to read through, or have to run one more badly composed sample sheet through 4.1.6.2 to discover, there was never a problem before you started monkeying with it. When, what date and time, will it be safe to accept updates to LibreOffice through the Ubuntu software centre ?When will there be a plain English assurance that all traces of this foolishness have been completely and utterly removed from the pipeline? Or are there people at LibreOffice still clinging to this as an "enhancement" and are leaving it in in any form, even as an option? Anything less than a clear statement of a complete and utter withdrawl of all parts of this from the pipeline, will say to me, all versions of LibreOffice past 4.1.6.2 (the version I currently use) are potential years of work-destroying poison that are incompatible with every other spreadsheet program and are to be avoided at all costs. Daily I will have to uncheck to decline updates to LibreOffice through the software centre. One day that will just become too much tedium, and I will move to another office package. When others finally discover their sheets have been mangled for more than a week now, with you fully aware of it, and you have done nothing to push functional software to their machine through updates, and they read even a fraction of these pages, I doubt many of them will even give LibreOffice a second chance. End the mangling that is going on right now out there in the field. That should be the #1 priority. Then a clear statement so I believe you and all of LibreOffice finally understand.Works as expected with versions 4.3.4 and master (4.4.0.0.alpha2) whatever the value of the option UpdateReferenceOnSort is.Please, try again with the last update of the version 4.2.7 provided by Ubuntu.Closing as WorksForMe.
id=86402	Hello and thanks,I have 3 problems: two with password encrypted spreadsheet files, one withhe using English and Persian in one file, as follows:1. I have an excel 2007 file, which I've encrypted with one password for viewing and editing. LibreOffice Calc opens with the password, but won't let me edit, and although I've hit many keys, when I want to close, doesn't ask for saving, which of course means it has opened as a read-only file. I think it is because Calc accepts one password only.2. Now, I have another xlsx file, with the same password for viewing and opening, but with different name and contents from the former. When I want to open this latter while the former is open, it asks for password, but won't let me type my password in the box!I have saved these two files as .ods too, yet the same problem exists without any change.3. Another problem is that when I type in Persian, I cannot see upper part of the characters (this exists in the Writer too, and in the worst form ever possible, which I'll report right after this one), and worse than that, when I open an excel file (*.xlsx), the sheets of which have a right-to-left order, and I add another sheet, no matter what I do, this last one will have a left-to-right order!These bugs are making me use Microsoft Office yet, and I don't want to; it's an agony to do your work partially: some parts on another system with MsOffice, and some on my own Kubuntu.Thanks again for bearing with me to the end of this endless report! :-) Hello,Thank you for filing the bug.

id=86897	CreatedSample part of content.xml, double format tags after "T31" and "T32"For the third time in two months I had this Format Error in different ODS-charts. In the attached sample (part) double format tags are found after "T31" in col 3884 and again after "T32" in col 4169. It is possible to repair the chart but annojing and needs quite some knowledge about XML format and a good editor.In LO and OO Forums several help requests concerning this error can be found.I hope this bug can be fixed soon. Perhaps also a general tool to repair XML format errors would be helpful. If it exists already it should be mentioned in the help of LO.

When I start ICEWM or XFCE, the wrong high-contrast-theme appears the first time. The menue isn't black.When I open it under KDE 4.10.5 the menue disappears and the high-contrast-theme appears. I open a file and close the file (click on the black right upper corner of the window, where the 'x' should be) and the wrong theme has been gone - but the black background for menu is already there.Ok, I revert status to UNCONFIRMEDPlease read this message in its entirety and do not revert change.This is simply an update to the priority/severity of the bug. Blockers are reserved for incredibly rare cases which this bug does not meet. We use an objective standard of what is or is not a blocker and this does not count as a blocker.Setting priority:Normal - this is just a normal bug...nothing particularly special about it.High - regression.Again please do NOT change the severity back as it does not help at all in pushing the bug forward and instead only confuses our objective standards - leading to developers not trusting the system. Setting to blocker will have zero impact towards moving the bug forward.Thanks for your understanding.(In reply to Joel Madero from)This has been the first time I set a bug to "BLOCKER". Who will decide it isn't? I couldn't test this version of LO in my desktop-environmemt, because I couldn't see anything in the menue.This version is unusable for me. There are many regressions in bugs I have reported. The regressions are set to "medium" - because I could work with a workaround. But with this regression I couldn't work at all.So it definitely isn't based on "this prevents ME from using the software." Blockers must be discussed thoroughly within QA, then presented to the ESC to determine if it is indeed a blocker...to be honest in 3 years I think I've seen 2-3 blockers....it is very rare.For more information you can see:Basically we need solid proof that this affects a wide (very very wide) amount of people, affecting multiple platforms, and essentially completely preventing (lots) of people from using the software. That is the only time we'd block a release.(In reply to robert from)NOREPRO with LO 4.4.0.0.beta2 + Ubuntu 14.04 (64bit) + Unity.Hmmm...I had no issues w/previous builds either.(In reply to robert from)If I understand correctly:1) You have issues under multiple WMs2) For ICEWM and XFCE, the issues only appear the first time you load LibreOffice (?)3) The worst behavior (e.g. with black menu) is under KDEQuestion: Do you have a high-contrast theme enabled? (intentionally)(In reply to Robinson Tryon (qubit) from)This is. It appears with every WM here. Not the black menue.Yes, but only with OpenSUSE 12.3 64bit rpm. Tested it with OpenSUSE 13.1 64bit rpm on another system - there the black menu (and also the high-contrast-theme when opening first time) doesen't appear.The enabled theme is oxygen. Have opened both systems and switched all to the same behavior in KDE - but couldn't get away the black menu (and also the high-contrast-theme when opening first time).The difference between both systems: There are some other WMs installed on the system with the buggy behavior. Had to install this WMs for getting the right screenshots for LO-Base-Handbook in Germany.Confirmed w/ openSUSE 13.1, KDE4 de 4.11.5, LibreOfficeDev_4.4.0.0.beta1_Linux_x86-64_rpm installed in parallel w/o desktop integrationchanged importance according to flowchart as it makes LibO totally unusable and happens at every launch.However prio only to HIGH (and not to highest) as only one platform seems to be affected (so far)Adding self to CC if not already onLet's put this on MAB list if it's so critical.Adding now.For those of you seeing this problem, a bibisect would be really helpful to get it fixed...I'm still not convinced that this is a blocker, nor am I convinced that the problem has been clearly described...but none the less a bibisect would help.(In reply to Joel Madero from)Problem: All users, who could confirm this bug, use OpenSUSE. If I understand it the right way bibisecting isn't possible with OpenSUSE.Next problem: The bug doesn't appear on every OpenSUSE-installation. Could be the same OpenSUSE-installation on other hardware would work right with LO 4.4.*RegardsRobert(In reply to Joel Madero from)+10000. Why was this added to MAB?Because others have a different opinion and it's good to respect those too ;) Seems like for some people this bug makes LibreOffice literally unuseable. That being said - I'd prefer lowering it to major-highest, but I've already done enough fiddling with this bug....So please write down, what should be described better. I have added screenshots, which would show the problem. I wrote down the system where the bug appears. This is a system, where all version up to 4.4.0.0 alpha wouldn't show this error. First apperas with 4.4.0.0.Beta1.... and with this buggy behavior LO is totally unusable with the system I described.

Thanks for triaging this.Crash repro with 4.1, not with 4.0.5 (although it was slow) for. I'll mark as regression so far. I didn't test Stefan'sand steps fromnor.Because of the hint to(GDI problem) I have made new tests with the spreadsheet document "Test_Comment_Crash.ods" attached to.Result: I think that the first "Save" or "Autosave" creates very much GDI objects.First I have increased the GDI quote in Windows from 10000 to 60000 to prevent the crashes (and reatarted the system to activate the change). A new test with my document gave no crash (but after document was saved and LO should be closed, shutdwon of LO was hanging - see). Then I have "installed" Nirsoft GDIView to see the GDI objects counter at further tests.The counters I have seen at the several tests were not exactly the same, but they were in the same ranges always. The figures below are from one of the tests. When the document was opened and I had navigated to the first sheet ("Altix I bis III") the GDI counter ("All GDI") was 125. After the four first comments were inserted and before the document was saved the GDI counter was 255.This means that every comment has increased the counter by 27 or 28, although the comments are hidden. I don't if this correct or not. Because the comments are not shown I think only the bitmanp counter should be increased by 1. While the document was saved the GDI counter has extremly increased from 255 to 9873!!!After some additional comments have been inserted the old limit of 10.000 was exceeded.Interestingly:- Only at the first save (or maybe also Autosave) the GDI counter increases extremly. At additional saves the counter has not increased or increased only slightly. - At "Undo" the GDI counter does not decrease and at "Redo" it does not increase.These tests were made with LO 5.3.0.2 (x64).I've tested this with a build that contains fix for, and I can't reproduce the crash.Createddebug from procdump dumpConfirm. No crash and saving as before, slow. I'd kindly ask Stefan to test all those before closing. But, I get dump with procdump with error cppu3.dll!uno_type_equalData.Should that be considered the same bug?(In reply to Timur from)No. I'd treat that as a different issue.Test withVersion: 5.4.0.0.alpha0+Build ID: b41186a2fc49e440890b8c86e5367352ffaf9cd6CPU Threads: 4; OS Version: Windows 6.19; UI Render: default; TinderBox: Win-x86@42, Branch:master, Time: 2017-01-26_01:50:40Locale: de-DE (de_DE); Calc: groupFirst I have tested only the duplicate:Result:No crashes, GDI counter increases only slightly while file was saved.

id=87119	ReferenceThis spreadsheet loads correctly into 4.1.5, 4.1.6, 4.2.7, and 4.3.4. In 4.4beta (and reported by raal, on 4.5 alpha and 4.3.6) much of the spreadsheet does not load correctly (e. g. look at the T Rank sheet). Raal reports that it does load correctly on 4.4alpha.This was determined in conjunction with filing(which is not related).This spreadsheet is quite complex, using names as unparameterized macros. I can confirm:with Version: 4.4.0.0.alpha0+Build ID: dea4a3b9d7182700abeb4dc756a24a9e8dea8474I can see data on sheet TrankNo data with Version: 4.4.0.0.alpha1+Build ID: b800d0b6ad74ce4a9adb23b865dd174d1eefa47b; bibisectable with 44alpha2onlyDataloss.On the sheet are data loaded through names, for example =rr_dName : rr_dRange: IF(B12="";bk;T(OFFSET($'All results'.$E$1;$P12;0))&T(altern))Yes, that's what I've done for most of the spreadsheet, used names rather than actual formulas in cells.

id=87876	Createdoptions dialogOn the Tools > Options dialog and goto the view entry and the new entries added under graphics output are crushing the entries in the column to the left of it. This is likely being caused by the long text label 'Force OpenGL even if blacklisted (might expose driver bugs)'. How can I see these OpenCL entries? I don't have them in my LO 4.4.0.0.beta1. Do I have something to enable to see them?You have to have 4.4 or master to see them. You can easily get it from hereCreatedclip of dropdown menu open, shows full width@Jay, *,Dialog can be resized horizontally if space is available. Otherwise not really an issue as the dropdown list is fully readable. Only the exposed item in the widget is truncated, and that pretty minor. Even the 'old' view in your clip shows truncated. Resolving invalid.No regression, dropdown list items are fully readable. Also, as the dialog can be expanded or shrunk as user prefers there is no loss of function.Resolving invalid.Hi Stuart,By default, the dialog should look as we intend it to look and IMHO, that is the not case here. In the old version, we could read 'Automatic' fully, and actually looking at the older version again, there isnt a reason for 'Use system font for user interface' to be on two rows when there was so much space on the right. So if anything, 'Force OpenGL even if blacklisted (might expose driver bugs)' should be allowed to be on multiple rows so it doesnt cramp items on the left column, and the left column should be increased so 'Use system font for user interface' appears on one row.OK, back to new... if you really want to fix it.line #101The containing Gtk frames/grids have the same padding 12 left and 6 top, 6 between rows with nothing set right.So would be two ways to "fix" this visually, move the "(might expose driver bugs)" warning to its own Gtk label, or figure out a way to add a line break to the overly long label for the GtkCheckButton--I think that can be done. Adolfo?Either should relax the width truncation of the frames at the dialogs default width, I don't think we'd want to make the width any wider as it would look bad and consume too much screen.CreatedOptions Dialogue with German LocalisationThe situation is even worse in the German localisation.

Only after closing and reopening the document, changes are visible in lower cells.Attached is an example sheet. To test my issue, please open it and enter another date in A16. After pressing ENTER, A17(,A18,...) should display the same date just entered. On my system, it does not.

I'll give code pointers and findings here later.The cause was that during unsharing the formula group the grouped area listeners were discarded with mxGroup->endAllGroupListening(), as necessary, but not re-established for the newly formed two groups (or single cells, depending on length of group and split position). Here the area happened to be BCA_LISTEN_ALWAYS because of INDIRECT() being used in the originally reported document, but the same scenario is hit with ordinary areas as can be seen with the simple reproducer document I attached.In this case that happened in ScColumn::DetachFormulaCell() called via ScColumn::GetPositionToInsert() and could quite easily be fixed by letting sc::SharedFormulaUtil::unshareFormulaCell() return two ScFormulaCellGroupRef that could be used to re-establish listeners via SharedFormulaUtil::startListeningAsGroup()However, there is a bunch of other places that call sc::SharedFormulaUtil::unshareFormulaCell() or sc::SharedFormulaUtil::splitFormulaCellGroup() or sc::SharedFormulaUtil::unshareFormulaCells() or sc::SharedFormulaUtil::splitFormulaCellGroups(), also in cell mass handlers, that would either discard the group area listeners or leave the listeners unadjusted. Some of them tricky and where re-establishing the listeners after each single split would not be desirable as a resulting group could get split again in the same loop. All of them need to be inspected and adapted before the group area listeners can be reactivated. That is more work than probably can be reliably done until 4.4.0.3 on Monday, which is why I disabled the group area listeners for now.I've come up with a correct fix for this, and with it, we don't have to disable the entire group area listeners.

Especially on more complex documents with linked images that had been failing.The "svtool/GraphicManager: properly decrease mnUsedSize on unregister ops" patch was already pushed down to 4.4 and is in TBs for 4.4.2 already.And, things seem well behaved with documents with linked images on at this point with Version: 4.4.2.0.0+Build ID: dd53735c5fe98fa4f8da4bf214a04b7883bf73c8TinderBox: Win-x86@42, Branch:libreoffice-4-4, Time: 2015-02-11_15:55:36Locale: en_USBut should the "sw: avoid temporary object creation to build GraphicPrimitive2D" be cherrypicked down to 4.4 as well?(In reply to V Stuart Foote from)This patch fixes a performance regression related to image loading so it seemed a good idea to backport and it might fix this bug (so verification would be appreciated).This other change also improves the performance, but by default we backportsonly bug fixes, so if this one has no visible effect, then I would not cherrypick it.Tested on Windows 7 sp1, 64-bit en-US--against's 40 page .ODT with multiple local linked files with Version: 4.5.0.0.alpha0+Build ID: 40b1e8266e47792d354cd457c652bfb0f0a21e69TinderBox: Win-x86@62-TDF, Branch:MASTER, Time: 2015-02-11_00:13:43Locale: en_USand also with Version: 4.4.2.0.0+Build ID: dd53735c5fe98fa4f8da4bf214a04b7883bf73c8TinderBox: Win-x86@42, Branch:libreoffice-4-4, Time: 2015-02-11_15:55:36Locale: en_USwhich does not have the "sw: avoid temporary object creation to build GraphicPrimitive2D"; it seems fully functional now with just the "svtool/GraphicManager: properly decrease mnUsedSize on unregister ops" patch.Setting resolved, but if folks discover a specific case that continues to cause issue please reopen.Version: 4.4.2.0.0+Build ID: dd53735c5fe98fa4f8da4bf214a04b7883bf73c8Same environment:Tried around with the file i submitted in the 2nd comment. Now it behaves like version 4.3.6.x. Scrolling up and down the appearing image-frame shortly shows the 'Read error' before the image loads.

Thank's for the efforts.(In reply to Nicolo from)Great! Thank you for verifying.Yes, I see it also, but I don't believe the "Read error" message has ever been more than a nuisance.

Many thanks!pedroAs mentioned inand confirmed by further comments the 'Read Error' message showing up shortly was 'always there'. But i experience reguarly that the 'Read Error' stays longer and the CPU gets more and more occupied. Some times Writer is blocked for some seconds, or longer, then the menu is available again. Yesterday it was for longer and the CPU was getting hot. Writer didn't freeze completely anymore since this bug was closed, but the basically the problem seems still to be there. It happens regularly with documents containing linked images.My specs are described in(with always the latest Development Versions of LibreOffice and now with 4.4.4.3) and there is also a link to sample document.Kind regards@Nicoloplease do not change version...as written below the version field (even it seems nobody pays attention to it) it has to indicate EARLIEST AFFECTED not LATEST affected so I revert it to 4.4.0.3as the whiteboard indicate the target is 4.5.0 (now called 5.0.0) so there's no surprise you still see the bug in the 4.4.4.3 release since the fix it's only in the 5.0.x branchdid you effectively test the 5.0.0.2 RC release?if some kind of problems persist in that release I suggest to open a clean new report about that and put the current one under "see also"it's always better to open a new one instead of reopening an old fixed issue with lot of comments, expecially when the bug evolved and is not exactly the same as in the original reportso reverting status to RESOLVED FIXED(In reply to tommy27 from)....sorry, did not notice that the 4.5.0 target indicated a testcase and that the fix was already present in 4.4.2anyway I still think you should open a new report about residual issues to avoid further confusion.Migrating Whiteboard tags to Keywords: (regression)[NinjaEdit]

As this bug has not runthrough that process (including writing a short rationale forthis bug being a candidate and other who are watching thetracker bug silently approving that rationale etc), its priorityis set to high.

On the other hand LO 4.3 runs well on OSX. So anyone relying on the PDF feature (like I do) should stay with 4.3 and be happy. LO 4.3 should run problem free the next 10 years on all upcoming OSX versions.(In reply to deepflight5 from)There's a simply workaround for this bug, try to use OSX own pdf printer instead. Just press cmd+p for the printer dialog and choose save as pdf.But that's a very feature-deprived workaround as the export doesn't then include things like a table of contents, active links for cross-references, etc.I do a weekly newsletter that includes SVG vector graphics. Exported via the OSX Quartz engine all SVG ends up as garbage in Apple's Preview. Exported via the GhostScript of LibreOffice all SVG is in Preview just fine.

I could not find the 4.4 alpha series.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Two work-arounds for this ...First, the easy and obvious one, which we all no doubt already use: keep a copy of 4.3.x handy for exporting to PDF.Advantage: the output is always what we expect.Disadvantages: it's a 650MB work-around which needs to be installed somewhere, ideally in a location that won't conflict with 4.4 and may have unintended consequences when accessing user profiles, especially if both are open or active at the same time.Second, the more fiddly one, which takes a lot of trial and error to get right: it is possible to convert to PDF via Pandoc and LaTeX in a form closer to what was intended.Requirements: Pandoc (available from pandoc.org), latexdiff (available from macports.org or tug.org), latexmk (available from macports.org or tug.org), texlive-latex (available from macports.org or tug.org), texlive-latex-extra (available from macports.org or tug.org), texlive-latex-recommended (available from macports.org or tug.org). Alternatively the much smaller BasicTeX package (available from tug.org) can be substituted for a full installation, but it may require additional work to support all available fonts.Method: save ODF as Microsoft .docx, edit as necessary (at minimum remove footers and page numbering) and then in the Terminal run (in the directory where the file is):pandoc -f docx -t latex -o file.pdf file.docxNote: that images are not included, points and bullets lose their content and tables take a bit of fiddling to word wrap correctly (may require faking it with multiple table rows and hiding the borders). The output will always look like a LaTeX document, noticably different from LibreOffice and other PDFs. Page numbering is automatic by default with numbers in the centre at the bottom of the page. Also note that the best results with pandoc were achieved with Microsoft's docx format, both Docbook and HTML conversions resulted in extremely annoying editing challenges before producing the PDF (though a preliminary run using HTML could produce a LaTeX file with the relevant code to insert images to be pasted into another LaTeX conversion from a .docx file).Advantages: Does not require two versions of LibreOffice, avoids user profile conflicts, saves space from second copy of LibreOffice (if BasicTex used or if LaTeX was installed anyway).Disadvantages: LaTeX tools and libraries take more space than a second copy of LibreOffice (unless BasicTex is used), requires additional editing specific to producing the PDF, loses pictures (can be restored by exporting to LaTeX .tex first and editing the LaTeX code manually or with a LaTeX editor).Recommendation: If you don't use LaTeX for anything else already and/or have no familiarity with it, do not use this workaround. If you have used LaTeX and are cautious with available disk space, try the BasicTex variant of this work-around. If you are more familiar with LaTeX then you might consider this work-around.So, which do I use? Both, with a full LaTeX installation, it depends on the target audience of whatever the document is. If I don't use LaTeX I have to shutdown LibreOffice 4.4 before launching 4.3. I've got 4.3.7.2 installed in /Applications/ and 4.4.3.2 installed in $HOME/Applications/ (to apply the language pack I copied the pack's bzipped tarball from the installer into $HOME/Applications/LibreOffice.app/ and extracted it via the Terminal).LO 5.0 beta1 was released and no fix for this issue. Please, can any of LO developers gives us when they want to fix this? Because PDF export has becomes a bit useless function since LO 4.4 for Mac user. For me it is a crucial function.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***I managed to build 4.4.0.0alpha2 and it has the formatting error. 4.4.0.0alpha1 would not compile for me.Timeline of bug:20 Nov 2014: 4.4.0.0beta1 tag created (release has bug) 6 Nov 2014: 4.4.0.0alpha2 tag created (compile has bug)19 Oct 2014: 4.4.0.0alpha1 tag created (unknown)13 Oct 2014: 4.4 branch freezeremember 4.3 branch does not have this bug, so I want to assume the bug was introduced in October 2014.Possible files involved:vcl/source/outdev/text.cxxvcl/source/gdi/sallayout.cxx "To justify a text string, Writer calls OutputDevice::GetTextArray()"vcl/source/gdi/pdfwriter.cxxvcl/source/gdi/pdfwriter_impl.cxxI do not know enough about these files to make a judgement, but there were a lot of changes.

Click "Current Selection".Up comes a panel that offers various sorting options; leave as is and click "Ok".Libre Calc crashes. This can be confirmed by restarting Libre Calc which offers to recover from a crash on that document, and it recovers successfully.Apport is automatically triggered which filed this bug report in the first instance.Note that normally one would want to sort the entire sheet by one or more columns, but in this application I am just sorting the column to look for non-blank data and I will Undo the sort subsequently.

id=90773	CreatedSample PresentationOpening impress presentations take a very long time with LibreOffice 5. Using the small sample presentation attached LibreOffice Impress has the following response times:LibreOffice 4.4.3: 5 sLibreOffice 5.0.0: 45 sDegradiation of loading time seems to depend on the number of slides contained within the presentation:(1) With 10 or less slides loading times of LibreOffice 4.4.3 and LibreOffice 5 are similar.(2) With 30 slides (sample presentation) loading times of LibreOffice 5 are much worse than loading times of LibreOffice 4.4.3.LibreOffice 5 is compiled from the current revision from master. Loading LibreOffice itself is included within the measurements. As LibreOffice has been loaded from SSD the time allotted to loading LibreOffice is very small in relation to loading the presentation itself using LibreOffice 5.The problem has been observed on Mac OS X 10.10.3 with LibreOffice 5. It doesn't seem to be present in earlier releases of LibreOffice. @Thorsten : please indicate exactly how you opened the file so that I can test in a comparable manner, as you mention that document loading times also included app startup time.If the problem is in the app startup time, then overall times for opening a giving document are all the more relative.Setting to NEEDINFO pending requested information.

The delay is visible with a 99MB presentation (over 100 slides), which is opened by LibreOffice 4.4.3.1 in less than 5 seconds and by LibreOffice 5.0 Alpha in over 40 seconds. Actually, the file is loaded fast (more or less, the same time for both LibreOffice versions), but the visualization takes significantly longer.FWIW, my test bed :Mac mini Server (mi-2010)2,66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo4 Go 1067 MHz DDR3NVIDIA GeForce 320M 256 MoI have just tried this on one of my own Impress ODP files that contains just 35 slides of text (no images, no drawings or tables)Select file in Finder, right mouse button click, Open withLO is not running previous to launch.LO4422 : 17.5 secondsLO5 dev alpha daily 21/04/2015 : 1 minute 48.5 seconds !!!Another of my presentations contains 50 slides, coloured background, some images, but mostly text.LO4422 : 6.6 secondsLO5dev daily 21/04 : 2 minutes 33.8 secondsI have noticed that the problem is more marked when one switches application context after shutdown of LibreOffice, i.e. when one clicks on another application window before opening an ODP file.There are no blockers!I noticed more severe performance problems with Impress. Moving objects with arrow keys has very long delays and is in many cases not completed correctly. I don't know whether this is due to the same reason as opening files with long delays or another problem with a different reason.The development version of Impress is not usable for creating presentations for now. I had to switch back to LO 4.4.3.Problem is still present - with LO 5.0 beta as well as with LO 5.1 from master.The issue concerning object moves with arrow keys seems to be a different issue, because I'm able to reproduce it now. I will file a different bug.The issue seems to have disappeared using LO from master. It is still present in LO 5.0 beta. I recommend fixing it in LO 5.0 beta too.The issue seems to have disappeared in LO 5.0 beta too. There are still other performance issues with Impress. Impress seems to become slow when working for a while, e.g. 10 or 15 minutes. Compared with LO 4.4 Impress performs still worse.Significant Impress performance issues still exist in LO 5.0.1, 5.0.2, and master. Typing of characters as well as inserting objects and many other operations become very slow after a while. Creating a presentation with Impress from LO 5 is very annoying. I'm able to use LO 5 with Writer and Calc, for Impress I have to use LO 4.5.@ QA: It seems this regression is getting less attention. As the original FILEOPEN issue seems to be resolved, is it reasonable to file a dedicated new issue to raise attention?(In reply to Thorsten Wagner from)Yes, please do. The developers (and the rest of us) can easily get bogged-down in comments and bug-change history that's unrelated and irrelevant to the particular issue that remains.If the FILEOPEN problem is fixed, please mark the bug as RESOLVED WORKSFORME so we can clear it off the open pile :-)The original FILEOPEN issue seems to be resolved. I will file another bug for the general performance issue.Migrating Whiteboard tags to Keywords: (notBibisectable perf)[NinjaEdit]Dear All!I am using laptop with Core i5 3rd generation, 4GB RAM. I working with LibreOffice 5.3.0.3. My problem is the presentation files take too long to open when I open them. I opened LibreImpress file of size 9.9 MB which contains mostly charts and tables, some images, it takes around 7-8 mins. average to open the file every time. Please help to resolve the issue.Thanks,Peeyush

This results in some text being ridiculously shrunk. * Not only that, but it is comparing apples to oranges; original font ascent/descent with the bounding box of the fallback glyphs, which results in different scale ratios depending on the shape of the glyphs at hand, which leads to all sorts of funny and irregular text. * Even worse, the PDF export is completely broken in this case; it uses the scaled down glyph widths but the unscaled font size, resulting in cramped unreadable text.That commit is two years old, and I canât reproduce the crash with my 4.3 installation nor with (a few months old) master build.

Please test, but closing WFM.=-=p.s. - It might be better if the preview in a case where the glyph is not defined for the font showed a generic "not defined this font" error. But that would be a different issue.(Using Ubuntu 14.04.3 with LO 5.0.2.2)I have to second the P.S. by V. Stuart Foote.Specifically, if a character/glyph is displayed on the right side of the Insert Special Characters dialog, and a different font is then chosen that doesn't contain that character/Unicode block, the "Subset" becomes blank and the previous sample character (in the previous font) remains displayed along with the grid of lower ASCII characters from the new font.Of course, once a valid Subset for the new font is chosen, things correct themselves, but this could be confusing to many users and isn't very elegant. Clearing the sample character display upon any new selection in the Subset OR font before proceeding would seem to be called for.But the regression itself seems to have been corrected.

id=92148	Note: I spotted this bug in 5 Beta1, but it's still present in 5 Beta3 for me.When Math is started or a Math formula is inserted anywhere else, a sidebar appears on the left. I thought it takes up too much space and tried to undock or remove it, which didn't work, so I resized it to "very thin".LibreOffice then locked up, with the icons in said sidebar constantly flickering.What's worse is that LOffice REMEMBERS this resize after forced shutdown, so any future attempts to open Math result in an instantly locked up window. It happened at least acouple of times that the repainting of the leftpanel of the Draw window made my entire desktop unresponsive. Onlythrough a text console was I able to end LibreOffice. Hence I amassigning severity CRITICAL.The problem is still apparent in the daily dbgutil bibisect repositoryversion 2015-06-19.Working in the 50max bibisect repository, I see from `git bisect good` ...

id=93113	Not sure if this is fixed yet or not but I was having frequent freezes and crashes in the LO 4.4.x so I decided to upgrade to 5.0.4 to see if the bug had been fixed.It hasn't. I'm making a document that uses lots of special characters. The dialog window used to insert them often becomes slow and unresponsive. Often this completely freezes LO. I have to kill the application, restart it, and recover the document.Sometimes, a special character is inserted and it disappears too.

I use Draw daily for all of my work so when something is broken I usually notice quickly.Also, I am using Linux not Windoze so I would not be surprised if this only affects 64bit linux users.Thanks for test.I can't reproduce also with Draw.Please, does it happen with all Fonts and any subset?, could be useful for devs.Createdincorrect font table (5.0.0.x)CreatedCorrect font table (4.4.5.2)It is an intermittent bug unfortunately.I migrated to the 5.0.0.x release candidates because the freezes were affecting my work so often I was afraid I would corrupt my work document with the frequent document recovery processes.Unfortunately, the freezes also affect the upcoming 5 series.What I have managed to determine is that the font table problem reported in my other bug (probably related to this bug) affects 5.0.0.2, 5.0.0.4, and 5.0.0.5I have downgraded to 4.4.5.2 and the tables are now rendered correctly.

At this point there is two graphics. The undo seems to be "out" by the number of nodes involved in a graphic.Seems to me that all would be a lot easier if anchored to paragraph acted like anchored to last character of the paragraphI confirm this still exists, by following the steps in, in LO5.3.0alpha.I note the instructions had to be interpreted a bit - when "insert image", actually needed an extra paragraph (blank for me) at the end, before copying.I inserted a GIF file.I've seen this before and did not know why it happened, very good we have steps to reproduce.Debian. Local build:Build ID: 01cad4990d41ed06bb9c0504cef397121ee470f3(2016-08-25)would be great to have a trace with debugging symbols on Linux or Windows - ultimately it looks like a NULL pointer de-reference =) could we bisect it ? =)@MichaelWhat kind of trace do you want? We have backtraces on Linux andWindows. In a recent dbgutil build on Linux, I see the same functionnames from the assertion down to about (IIRC) frame 48.In, Matthew Francis reports reproducing the problem withversions "back to the year dot". I think this forecloses thepossibility of bisecting the bug, right?I note that this bug covers at least an assertion (comments 12 and19), an access violation (comments 4 and 7), and "Fatal Error"(description and), as well as unspecific "crash". Would itbe useful to split off the assertion, for example, into a separate bugreport? My rationale for including the assertion, back at,was merely that it happened with the same STR.Ah - yes, I see your nice trace now Terrence - thanks for that =) if it is an ancient bug, then yes no point in bisecting. The last thing that would be useful would be a valgrind trace - in case it is a memory corruption issue (it seems un-reliable - so quite possibly) rather than a simple logic bug.Thanks !crashreport.libreoffice.org/stats/crash_details/beeff8a3-445c-4f90-8354-7929bd97ba46 forCreatedDrMemory logs.zipAre those of help instead of valgrind? It's Windows access violation.Unfortunately the drmemory trace doesn't appear to show the crash itself, but has a lot of leak reports instead, many of which may be false positives.

id=94772	CreatedSample fileLibreoffice cannot save certain .odt files. These files were all created with earlier versions of Libreoffice (< 4.3) and contain a large number of mathematical formulas. I first noticed this problem after upgrading to Libreoffice 5.0, however I have also experienced the same problem after downgrading to 4.4.5.Libreoffice has no problem opening the files. However, once the file is modified and a save attempt is made, the following error window comes up:"Error saving the document XXX: General Error: General input/output error." Versions: This bug appears when using Libreoffice 5.0.* and 4.4.5. Openoffice 4.1.1 has no problem opening and saving the same file.OS: This bug was reproducible on MAC-OSX 10.9 and 10.11. I attempted to reproduce the bug using Libreoffice 5.0.2 on Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 but could not.I tried to create a new empty writer file using Libreoffice 5.0.2.2, and paste the contents of the old file into the new file. I am unable to save the new file (same error). I also tried completely wiping Libreoffice from the disk (including Library/Application Support/Libreoffice) and reinstalling, but this made no difference.Interestingly enough, I can open one of these files, select "Save As", choose a new filename, and I am able to save the file. However, if I close and reopen Libreoffice, and then try to edit the new file, the same bug reappears.I have attached a sample file "NOTES1.odt". In addition, Libreoffice appears to create a log file when the save fails called "document_io_logring.txt". I have pasted the contents below.**********************37b43f919e4de5eeaca9b9755ed688758a8251feRethrowBad Zip File, ZipException: Zip END signature not found!RethrowElement does not exist and cannot be created: "Meta.xml"RethrowRethrow/lo/rel50/sfx2/source/doc/objstor.cxx:414: Rethrow/lo/rel50/sfx2/source/doc/objmisc.cxx:260: Resetting Error.Bad Zip File, ZipException: Zip END signature not found!RethrowBad Zip File, ZipException: Zip END signature not found!RethrowElement does not exist and cannot be created: "Meta.xml"Rethrow(THIS REPEATS MANY TIMES)Rethrow/lo/rel50/sfx2/source/doc/objstor.cxx:414: Rethrow/lo/rel50/sfx2/source/doc/objmisc.cxx:260: Resetting Error.Bad Zip File, ZipException: Zip END signature not found!Rethrow/lo/rel50/sw/source/uibase/app/docsh.cxx:498: /lo/rel50/sfx2/source/doc/objmisc.cxx:260: Resetting Error./lo/rel50/sfx2/source/doc/sfxbasemodel.cxx:3124: Storing failed!

A bibisect would really help move this forward.Did a test with the release candidate LibreOffice 5.1.0.3. That version complained that the file was corrupt. It asked if I wanted to repair the file, so I did and after that everything seems fine. I haven't looked to closely at the file but it seems all formulas etc. is there. Could someone try it with the latest version of LibreOffice Fresh to see if this is fixed there as well.I tested the file with the released version 5.0.1.3, and it worked (no complaints of a corrupt file, it just appeared to save normally). I also tried with several other files that I had which had similar problems, and they all appear to work with the latest release version.

Save, Close, Reopen > references are shown in a flash, but then it is destroyed.TODOCheck duplicatesCheck version (bibisect)No problem in 4.4.3.2, problem in all later versions***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Createdcross-reference-numbered paragraphThe same behavior in LO 5.0.1 and 5.0.2 and also if you use cross-reference directly to numbered paragraph - see attached file (open and update fields).This is a critical bug, because every .odt file with cross-references is broken after re-opening it.Createdbibisect logSee bibisect log for details.Each time a new cross reference is inserted a new bookmark is put around the source. These duplicated bookmarks are removed by the patch of 90808 Such duplicates should not be created. The reason for the duplicates is that the inserted mark is of type MarkType::CROSSREF_NUMITEM_BOOKMARK but after save&reload this is converted to a MarkType::CROSSREF_HEADING_BOOKMARK.Now the next insertion cannot find the CROSSREF_NUMITEM_BOOKMARK at the given position and inserts a new one.I am seeing this extensively in Writer for Windows, all versions of LO5 and it was in later releases of 4 as well. About a third of cross-references typically affected.Interestingly, there can be several references to one target, and some fail while others work properly.Also, if you construct a cross-reference of several parts (eg "see clause 26.1(a)(i)" where each part of the clause number is individually referenced) you can get partial failure eg the above reference could appear as:"See clause 26.1[Error-not found!](i)"If you delete and recreate a broken reference, it will fail again every time. But a reference that survives the first reload is stable forever.Normally, if you open the affected file in LO for Mac, there's no problem. The Windows version is far worse affected.This is an important one. In our case, it makes LO unusable in a law office.The only way I could fix the problems was:1) Revert back to LO 3.4.72) Completely remove the faulty cross-references from the document3) Close the document; quit LO4) Reopen everything5) Insert the x-references anewConclusion from these observations: x-references have been erratic all through LO 4 and 5 (thus far). Thank you big time for addressing that.thanks Oliver for fixing the root cause.regression from commit 679faffc68bb854af0f55d0f218698e2f372f00blooks to me there are 2 problems here, firstly the merge problem abovecausing heading-reference to be created instead of numbering-references,second is that in 4.4.x the heading-references stopped working inthis case.commit 9d0c51daea67104349cac26de9839afa8baeb099Author: Michael Stahl <>AuthorDate: Fri May 15 23:57:04 2015 +0200 tdf#90808: sw: fix detection of duplicate CrossRefBookmarks The check for existing bookmark positions is using the wrong position. It must use the Start of the pam, because the constructor of CrossRefBookmark only uses the Start of the pam.so the versions since 4.2.0 or so would create these documentswhere there can be more than one "__RefHeading__" bookmarks on a singleparagraph: every time you try to insert a new CROSSREF_NUMITEM_BOOKMARKit will find that there is no CROSSREF_NUMITEM_BOOKMARK on the paragraphand then wrongly insert another CROSSREF_HEADING_BOOKMARK on it.then with the fix for, we will import only the first of theseCROSSREF_HEADING_BOOKMARK in ODF import, and throw the rest of them awaybecause they are duplicates.if you're lucky then the bookmark that survives is the one that isreferenced by all the fields; if not, then you get lots of"Error: Reference source not found" once you update fields.i'm afraid we'll have to add some horrible hack to load all these corrupted documents.i've added something sufficiently ugly on master now.Oliver Specht committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":tdf#94804: prefix to save cross reference bookmark fixedIt will be available in 5.1.0.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

I do not know if you understand, how CRITICAL this bug is. I work in a small office using LO, but almost every document we use contains Cross-references, which caused we CAN NOT WORK on existing documents in LO. Downgrading LO is not a solution, because the upgrade from 4.X to 5.X caused loss of all added personal icons in the Toolbars which was horrible, so we are now back on MS Office (using one LO 4.3 and saving everything as .doc) and waiting for fixing the bug in a stable version. My propose for the future - such (from the viewpoint of a user) CRITICAL bugs which causes LO NOT WORKING (because we really can not use the Writer now) should be fixed in a stable version ASAP although in the way the new stable version contains only this one fix...I second Orwel's plea. I am a business technology journalist, and I have raved about LO in the media, so I felt obliged to issue a warning in the national Australian press when this bug hit. It's that damaging to business usersI'm on-side too. But at the same time want to thank you all involved for helping with that nasty bug.Oliver Specht committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "libreoffice-5-0-3":tdf#94804: prefix to save cross reference bookmark fixedIt will be available in 5.0.3.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours. Moreinformation about daily builds can be found at:Affected users are encouraged to test the fix and report feedback.Thank you very much!I just installed the 5.0.3.2 (RC2) and the bug is still present although(should be not present yet). Tested on x64 version (Win7) with the().Could you take a look at this, because it is not fixed as mentioned.I confirm this from my end as well. The bug is still present in the fresh versions of the application.Looking further into this, it may be that references created with older (buggy) versions are the ones that get corrupted. If this is the case, and all we need to do is recreate them one last time, this could be a decent compromise (to many, I hope). However, I cannot find information about this anywhere. Thank you for your further input about this.I confirm the bug occurs on documents of older versions. A manual delete of a cross reference and setting a new one solve the problem. The problem is not solved, if you only re-change the cross-reference (this means, double click it and set it one more time, you have to delete it completely before).I am not sure if recreating the CR one last time suggested by Yvan Rose is meant as an automatically or manually process. It is a good solution if the process will be done automatically by LO. If you suggest to make it manual, this is a horrible vision for me and my colleagues.Imagine, there are hundreds of documents created/re-saved in older LO Version. Some of these documents have more than 10 sites. Doing it manually would cost us hours and hours of work, you have to read all the documents through and think where the cross reference should point to.Sorry for my next words as they are not directly concerned with the solution of the case:I was a big fan of LO, trying to support the LO team mainly with my free time (tests of beta versions, reporting bugs...) and sometimes also with small contributions, but this BUG (present for more than a month) is so terrible that I slowly loose my faith into this product, really. Understand, there are people using LO as the sole office suite. I do not think each bug has the same "weight". There are CRITICAL bugs (causing LO is NOT WORKING in its basic functions properly) and other bugs. This kind of bug is CRITICAL (in my eyes) and makes LO really unworkable with (at least in our small office where almost each document contains cross references and we often go back to old documents).The problem with cross references is long-continuing (let see the bug reports of the past), I remember problems with cross-references in LO 3.5. And the problem occurs repeatedly (solved and than again occurred) in many versions. I think a new Version of LO should be released after more testing. I can not believe this kind of CRITICAL bug where CROSS REFERENCES ARE NOT WORKING could be overlooked and not solved for a such long time.I stopped to use Microsoft Office many years ago because it drove me crazy with repeated bugs of formatting. I feel myself now the same.One more time sorry for this post, but I felt I have to write this words hoping some developers will read it and discuss it in the higher level of Document foundation...there were 2 fixes for this bug, one to fix the creation of new cross references, and one to fix the import of existing documents written by older versions that contain the bad cross references.unfortunately only the first fix got sufficient reviewers to be includedin time for the 5.0.3 release, while the second fix will only be in the 5.0.4release.since this obviously causes confusion i will remove the 5.0.3 from the bugzilla whiteboard.if you are affected by the bug then use LO 4.4.6 or wait for LO 5.0.4.(In reply to Michael Stahl from)Thanks for clarifying, Michael!checked in 4.4.6.3Both this issue and 94063 are fixed there.Adding my thanks here. I have been a supporter of LO for years now, providing my yearly donation and encouraging my students to join in. On the other hand, I too have been experiencing a little bit of what Orwel was voicing earlier, about the quality control side of things. Given my experience as software developer (designer --I don't to programming), I am fully aware that innovation typically comes at the cost of instability. But perhaps The Document Foundation could work on strengthening the testing side of things a little more. If I could anything to help in that respect, for example in terms of voicing my opinion to the right people, I certainly would. (Thank you for any input there, if any.)In the meantime, I am grateful for all the work that everyone has poured in LO, by far the best office suite out there.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Varun Dhall committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":Added Test for tdf#94804 cross ref bookmarks created with wrong prefixIt will be available in 5.2.0.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

They say at the first step that "correct result displays" but don't say what that correct result should be. (For me, if I follow the instructions exactly, L2 on the Sheet3 displays #N/A. I assume that is not what is expected?)Please, if you want to provide a test document, just provide a sheet where doing a Ctrl-Shift-F9 after toggling "Tools:Options:OpenCL:Allow use of OpenCL" changes calculation results. That is all that is needed. No need to describe multiple steps of saving, loading, copying and pasting. (Having over 100 copies of a formula in sequential rows in a column will make OpenCL be used, as long as the formula uses only operators and functions from the OpenCL-enable-subset.)I assume the problem in the instructions is that the formula should use Movtos.A2, not just A2? Then I see the issue.Anyway, I am not sure if we want to mark all problems in OpenCL as duplicate of this bug or not?

id=95573	I can't install any extension since I upgrade on El Capitan (OS X 10.11)because the add-on manager freeze when I try. I try lot version of LO and I reset my configuration every time.@shunesburg : please indicate which version of LibreOffice you are using and whether it is AppStore or TDF downloadI use only the TDF LO.I try with the 4.4 and the 5.0, the both can't install any addon.Thanks.Well, I managed to install the Danger Sign gallery extension onVersion: 5.0.2.2Build ID: 37b43f919e4de5eeaca9b9755ed688758a8251feLocale : fr-FR (fr.UTF-8)but something is indeed not right.If I drag and drop an extension file onto the StartCenter, the Extension Manager UI launches and attempts to start the installation of the extension, but then appears to freeze indefintely, yet OSX doesn't see this as a hung app. When I tried to force quit the application via the Dock, I then a request to confirm installation of the extension. If I OK that request, the extension is then installed, so it would seem that the confirmation dialog is not displayed when it should be, or rather it is hidden from the user. Further testing required to nail down the exact problem.Confirming - tried with another gallery extension, the problem was even worse.Context switching seems to help a little, but I couldn't ever get the confirmation to install dialog to appear.This worked previously in OSX 10.10 ==>> regressionCreatedlldb outputokay, so context switching between desktops and other apps, eventually allows the confirmaiton dialog to be displayed, and then activated, but the whole LibreOffice app seems to grind to a hal and become unresponsive.I have enclosed the lldb output from my debug master build, hopefully that should enable one of the devs to see what is going wrong.@Michael: there's a lot of vcl calling in that lldb output, any idea ?when I'm in lldb and the freeze occurs in LO, I don't have access to input any commands to lldb (or at least, I haven't found a way of doing so), lldb appears to be waiting for the LO process to return some further token of information, which never happens (well, at least not until I can regain the focus of the app when the confirmation dialog OK button press is finally accepted.Looks odd; I'd love to see it bibisected (if we have a suitable repo). Sadly there is no easy environment variable for disabling grabs on Mac (that I know of).Also - any chance of a stack trace with debugging symbols (of all threads ?) =) thanks !There is something new?A patch or a future commit?It will be good if the bug could be solved before the 5.1 release.Noticed this before but now looking at it it seems to have gone to far:Clicking "Check for updates" in Extensions Manager on OSX in 5.1RC1 takes ages to check for updates of already installed extensions. I never got it to finish so it might be just stuck. The Extensions Manager just gets unresponsive.Since this could signal a problem of some kind of Internet connection, I manually downloaded LanguageTool 3.2 and installed it in Extension Manager manually over 3.1 by clicking "Add...". And again this installation takes ages, after more than 10 minutes the status is stuck somewhere around 10 % in the graphic representation ... The fans of the laptop started to work so it seems there is some "hard computational work" happening somewhere. Cannot figure out what is happening, but it obviously it is not due to Internet firewall or anything like that.I tried the same with LibreOffice Vanilla 5.0.2.2 (for OSX, the Collabora version in the iTunes) and I am seeing the same problems with updating included spelling/thesaurus extensions (LT cannot be installed since Vanilla does not support use of Java, so I cannot check that).I guess there is some serious error in the updating/checking for updates of extensions on OSX and this is a serious functionality flaw, that should be marked as a stopper on OSX, IMHO.Relatively few of us have Macs unfortunately; making this hard to test. I suspect some threading / event madness - provoked by the new main-loop work. Can you get a dbgutil build and get a log file with SAL_LOG=1 set - or at least the vcl.schedule log domain (both warn and info) is what I'm most interested in =)Norbert, and/or Andras - is that something that's easy to get ?So, testing this again on my latest master dbgutl build (20160104)I started unopkg gui in a lldb session.I was able to add an extension package, e.g. BaseTools-0.0.5.oxtThe extension installed for all users successfully, there was no stall or freeze.I then tried clicking on the Check for updates button, which gave the following console output :warn:sal.osl:60084:4:sal/osl/unx/socket.cxx:951: undefined addressand that is when the GUI freezes. Normally, what should happen is that a window is drawn with a list of all available updates, or else an empty window if none are available. However, this window never gets drawn, and that is why the app appears frozen.lldb remains in an expectant state, apparently waiting for something to happen, but not returning to the active debugging cli (how do I get that back, forcibly, if necessary, to input commands ?)The Mac process monitor app shows that LO has 5 running threads, and is occupying approximately 1.5% CPU, but dropping to 0% when switching context away from app.What I do notice in the Memory usage tab of the Monitor.app, is that the LO process has spawned 238 ports !!However, none of these ports appear to have had any network traffic.Hi Alex; nice debugging - can you get stack traces (even roughly) of all the live threads ? =)Thanks !In that previous test, I left LOdev running a full 6 minutes with no activity, in a seemingly frozen state. None of the buttons on the dialog would respond, I couldn't close the dialog by any means, I couldn't even quit LOdev via the normal menu entry or the dock entry. I had to force quit the app to regain lldb cli debugging control.(In reply to Michael Meeks from)How do I do that, lldb doesn't allow me to input anything from the cli session when LOdev is in that state ?Createdunopkg lldb output plus backtraceSo, forcing a break and killing the process allowed me to return to lldb and request a bt. Had to repeat this though, as lldb re-enters a kind of zombie mode, so the bt output might not be relevant to the particular state.Very odd, the trace you give seems to suggest that there are two dialogs concurrently running, one in each thread: frame #7: 0x000000010974b943 libdeploymentgui.dylib`dp_gui::UpdateDialog::Execute(this=0x0000000106244000) + 83 at dp_gui_updatedialog.cxx:600and frame #14: 0x00000001097280f7 libdeploymentgui.dylib`dp_gui::ServiceImpl::startExecuteModal(this=0x0000000108bdce70, xListener=0x00007fff5fbff3f0) + 2807 at dp_gui_service.cxx:284Which is somewhat interesting and unusual in itself; that 'bWait' is set is good - the app is waiting for events to do something.Are you sure there is no hidden window somewhere ? perhaps the transience / layering is wrong for them somehow ?(In reply to Michael Meeks from)Therein lies the problem - the window although initiated, is never displayed. In my testing with just unopkg (which of course starts an instance of the office in the background and causes the LO icon to appear in the dock), I had just two windows on my screen, the lldb terminal session and unopkg gui window - no amount of context switching, or moving windows around the desktop could make the update check window appear. I fear it is the same for the confirmation dialog window that is supposed to be displayed when installing an extension (as was reported initially in this bug report). Quite why these windows do not appear, or at least do not appear in a sufficient time frame for the user not to give up on the whole experience and kill the office, is beyond my knowledge.It could be the same or similar bug as that which afflicts the first opening of the Finder dialog when attempting a first open or save of a document after launch of LO (see)Hi Alex - thanks so much for persisting =) can we take a new approach ? I'd love to see the output from:export SAL_LOG=1on a dbgutil build. That should show us what the scheduler and quartz backends are doing - either for this case, or for the file-selector one. That is assuming you have a dbgutil build somewhere ?Thanks !I can reproduce the freeze under Fedora 23 too, if installing extensions using File->Open, instead of opening the extension manager first. Reproduced with my own 5.1/master builds, and only with gtk/gtk3 vclplugs, not with gen. Oddly I reproduce the same with Fedora's 5.0.4.2, but not with TDF's 5.0.4.2, nor with my own 5-0 build.Can be of course unrelated to the Mac problem.(In reply to Michael Meeks from)Hi Michael, yes, I have a dbgutil build, but where do I stick the export SAL_LOG=1 ?Do I add it to the sofficerc or some other file or is this something I can pass to lldb in some way ?Oh - you need the SAL_LOG in the environment - so I guess run from a shell and do:export SAL_LOG=1and then re-direct the output of LibreOffice to a file; no idea how to do that on Mac but on Linux:SAL_LOG=1 soffice >& /tmp/sal-log.txtMaxim - could you do the same ? - it'd be great to have that log.Thanks !CreatedSAL_LOG from Fedora 23CreatedSAL_LOG from OSX 10.11.2Shouldn't this be a stopper/blocker for 5.1?Maxim - your linux trace seems to show a live loop - most likely caused by an Invalidate occuring during the Paint of a Window.Any chance you could put a breakpoint in vcl/source/window/paint.cxx (Window::ImplInvalidate) - and get some stack-traces from there - when it is live-locked ?That would give the same symptoms (of not making progress) that we see on Mac, but the mac trace doesn't show the same symptoms - oddly.Thanks !Createdbacktrace 1Createdbacktrace 2Why the progress bar is updated, if I didn't accept the installation yet?Lovely; thanks Maxim ! =) there is (in a nutshell) a busy loop re-setting the progress bar's status there from an idle handler; not great ! but then again the priority of that idle handler is low so it shouldn't -really- affect rendering or making progress here I think - I'm surprised that it seems to.And - wow, this code is just horrific =) again a load of state being updated at 'idle' (ie. now in a busy loop) that is simply not changed from one iteration to the next. Horrors.IMPL_LINK_NOARG_TYPED(ExtMgrDialog, TimeOutHdl, Idle *, void)and the cut/paste coded:IMPL_LINK_NOARG_TYPED(UpdateRequiredDialog, TimeOutHdl, Idle *, void)are inexcusable bad.Michael Meeks committed a patch related to this issue.It has been pushed to "master":tdf#95573 - stop (crazy) busy loop from blocking rendering.It will be available in 5.2.0.The patch should be included in the daily builds available atin the next 24-48 hours.

The status of this report should rightly now be VERIFIED.VERIFIED: This option is only available when the current bug status is RESOLVED. You can mark a RESOLVED FIXED bug as VERIFIED, when you can confirm it is fixed with the version mentioned in the bug report. It is also pleasant for the developer who fixed the issue, and is a confirmation the problem is solved now. Otherwise a bug reporter can mark their own bug that is in RESOLVED WORKSFORME state as VERIFIED WORKSFORME to verify it is somehow fixed.If I'm not wrong it's pending for revision in versions 4.4 and 5.0., and I don't see your verification for those versions.

This will help us a lot in fixing this. Thanks.Maxim Monastirsky, i'm sorry, but I have no chance: the bug occurs randomly. Today I changed the document three times: twice it went well, once was corrupt.I suspect that my document has problems, because the frequency with which it is corrupt is unacceptable.(With Writer: Version 3 <-> 4 I never had problems)(In reply to Paolo Meozzi from)That's unfortunate. Adding Michael to CC. Maybe he has an idea why is this duplicate fo:background-color="transparent" added to styles.CreatedDocument template and macroI found a pattern! But I do not know how useful.The problem happens when I paste code fragment from Visual Studio (2013), but only when using a particular document template.Since version 4.x (I think), the pasted code from VS maintains the white background and thus change the background that I have assigned to the style "code" in my documents.For this reason I created a macro that applies the style and sets the background transparent the selected text.Everything works fine except in one case:1) I paste a snippet of code from VS (OK)2) applying macro (OK)3) paste the new fragment of VS within the code already formatted. (OK)4) apply the macro again (only) to the fragment just pasted (oh oh!)Save to disk ... and the document is corrupt: the background is set twice, transparent and white.I added the document templates and macros that format text.(In reply to Paolo Meozzi from)Very useful!

Could you try this?(In reply to Yousuf (Jay) Philips from)Can't find it right now, but I remember I saw it mentioned somewhere.Createdwindbg(In reply to Maxim Monastirsky from)Here's another try.Createdwindbg2i assume this backtrace is better.I'm getting this in 5.1.3.2. Not sure if it's the same crash, but it occurs under the exact same circumstances as reported here: in x64 build with deleted profile.Even then it doesn't occur every time, but it's been happening regularly.@Meeks: Can you check my backtrace for this first startup crash for windows x64?Hi Jay - so - you sure this is a crash ? ultimately your GL device looks like it should be black-listed so there should be no GL in-use.When we do the first-ever start; on some platforms it is expected that the first run installs and initializes extensions and then the main binary exits with a given return code and should be re-started by the wrapper =) [ at least this used to be the case left & right ].Whether that happens via ZwTerminateProcess I forget =) perhaps not - but ... then again - this trace:does indeed show some GL crash / badness. Can you confirm you generated that trace with this device:because at least my master blacklist has: <blacklist> <entry os="all" vendor="intel" compare="less" version="10.18.14.4264"> <device id="all"/> </entry>Which should knock out your intel 8.15.10.1930 driver ... very strange.Thanks !(In reply to Michael Meeks from)Hi Michael, yes sure.Yes i only run windows 7 on my laptop, which is where this crash report came from.Yes this is quite strange to me as this same thing doesnt happen on the x86 build.I might be encountering a slightly different version of this issue in master, but can't say for sure. Nevertheless, I openedon that, any hints are welcome.Is it better thanks to this?+ <entry os="7" vendor="intel">+ <device id="all"/>+ </entry>See tdf#101138Intel/GL - their windows / GL driver quality is something awful before that date I suspect. It is also quite possible/probable that the 64bit drivers are worse than the 32bit ones ;-) Having said that - as Julien says - if you're running Windows 7 + Intel - the driver should be black-listed by -commit 97fb2a8a43f11dba7c3e82380589b2334d09865aAuthor: TomaÅ¾ Vajngerl <>Date: Tue Jul 26 16:21:13 2016 +0900 tdf#101138 opengl: blacklist intel drivers for Win 7So is this still an issue in a recent 5.1.x ? I'd hope not -> marking fixed. Please re-open if you can reproduce with a recent 5.1.xThanks !

Unfortunately, users do not have neither Still nor the Fresh LibreOffice releases in the current Debian official branches (stable and testing, I mean). Therefore, it is impossible to install 5.0.x (Still) via package into Debian infrastructure.The release plan for LibreOffice and Debian are different, and there are no obvious proposals as for Firefox ESR/Debian, for example:"Mozilla releases new Firefox releases every 6 to 8 weeks.In parallel of these rapid releases, Mozilla proposes a version calledESR which is maintained for about 9 months.On the contrary, Debian having a longer release cycle (about every twoyears), release cycles don't align.Because of the complexity of backporting security fixes, Debian cannotmaintain a deprecated ESR release.To address this packaging issue, once a ESR cycle is over, Debian hasbeen accepting uploads of new ESR releases in the stable release." [1][1]:(In reply to Stanislav from)You can grab 5.0.x from libreoffice.org () or you can wait till next month when debian testing has 5.1.3 in the repo.

Note the profile is relatively smooth at the beginning, when LO is launched. The memory heap increases continuously when I drag and drop an extension onto the LO app icon in the dock and the install extension dialog appears (at which point the app stops responding).CreatedCall tree after dropping extension file onto LO app iconEnclosed is a compressed file with the call tree obtained via the Instruments.app with LO master on OSX. This represents all calls made up to the point where the extensions UI is displayed after having dropped an OXT file onto the LO app icon in the dock.CreatedTime profile of user callsThis file is a compressed text file of a time profile of user calls when LO-dev master is already running and an extension (OXT) file is dropped onto the app icon in the dock.I am having the same exact problem.LO Version: 5.1.4.2Mac 10.11.5I followed the procedure of going to the Extension Manager and choosing an extension from the open file dialog. The same exact thing happens where it starts for a few seconds but then hangs. If I leave it running, I get a memory error from my Mac stating that my system is about to run out of memory.This happens regardless of what extension I try to install.Hi, I'm just a whiner with nothing new to provide. But *please*, can this be assigned and fixed? I've been waiting and hoping for months now. I promise a $20USD donation to document foundation upon this bug being fixed and released.Ricky CharletI have this very same problem in OSX 10.11.6 with LibreOffice 5.1.4.2, and the Add button on the extension manager do NOT work either, so it seems I cannot install extensions at all.This problem is still there also in LO 5.2.0.4 (on OSX 10.11.6).As well as the update of existing extensions.This is a blocker for OSX releases.Until this is solved no LO releases should go out.The extensions system is a basic subsystem of LibreOffice, it must work or there should be a warning in the install/release notes and download page that this major feature is not working on OSX at all.We don't have blockers I'm afraid - time-based releases don't allow them.Coercing others into solving your favourite problems is not going to work. So - lets think of more positive ways.The ultimate reason why this bug is not fixed is: I don't have a Mac, I don't have access to a Mac, I'm not going to buy a Mac on my own $, and I don't have much time - even if I could solve the above.If someone can give me remote access to a Mac with a pre-build LibreOffice with debugging symbols, a console, and so on - then it would be easy enough to make progress here I think.Can you provide that ? (NB. if Apple were not quite so hyper-lame about forbidding virtualisation - then we could all debug and fix Mac problems, as we can do for Windows & Linux).Alex - the time profile looks interesting, but nothing jumps out of it. The bug is almost certainly quite trivial - an Idle handler or Timeout is being created inside another Idle handler or Timeout - and is starving the UI from being re-rendered. We just need to catch that and re-prioritise.(In reply to Michael Meeks from)Hi Michael,Is there any tool that you know of and which does not involve jumping through hoops to get it to work on OSX that I might be able to use to bring this along further ?CreatedApple traceFWIW, I am enclosing an Apple trace against my master 530 build which is produced when I force kill a hung LO process after dropping an OXT file onto the LO icon in the OSX Dock - don't know whether that helps muchI'm on Mac. If you said me what you need (log, testâ¦) to fix the problem, I can made it for you. If you need I have Teamviewer and I can let you made some test by yourself.Hi shunesberg - it would be awesome if you could do some of this remote debugging. Getting a build of master with --enable-dbgutil configured into it (from clean) would be really helpful; and then doing:export SAL_LOG=+INFO.vcl.schedule+WARN.vcl.scheduleinto the environment, and running and stashing the output of that while making it hang. Clearly it's a priority problem.If you could get that - I think we'd make some progress. Failing that - putting some breakpoints into vcl/source/app/scheduler.cxx to see what new Idle/Timeout task is being added, at what priority in order to make these bad things happen - would be great to find out =)Thanks !@Michael : I added a scheduler trace containing the output from the terminal with the SAL command you indicated. I don't think that is going to help much as it doesn't seem to identify which code path is responsible. This is just a short sample of the output, as I managed to bring my Mac mini to its knees by letting it run for 2 minutes or so. The same messages just seem to get respawned constantly.CreatedSAL schedule exportI ran that SAL export against my master debug enabled build@Michael Meeks: What would I do to run with "--enable-dbgutil".Where I type "export SAL_LOG=+INFO.vcl.schedule+WARN.vcl.schedule"I'm not a hacker, I don't know what to do. And the English it's not my native language.When I run in a terminal with:/Applications/LibreOfficeDev.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice(the option "--enable-dbgutil" is not recognized)But When I try to a

before compiling the software ;-) so - not a run-time parameter - it builds a -much- larger build with symbols, and logging and so on inside itself.Alex - thanks for the trace; if you are churning debug that fast from that place - then it is indeed an idle handling issue; it is strange that we get:info:vcl.schedule:1182:1:vcl/source/app/scheduler.cxx:242: Have active idle vcl::Window maPaintIdleso frequently - and yet (apparently) no UI update. I guess I need access to a Mac to poke at this one.I now have access to a remote Mac (thanks to Cloph), but - unfortunately - a truck-load of extraordinarily time-consuming business problems to solve - which can't wait, so getting a Mac setup, learning XCode, debugging etc. is not something I can get to in the next week or two I think; sorry ...***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***(In reply to Michael Meeks from)@Michael : I have a VM allocation trace profile produced with Apple XCode Instruments.The trace itself is 1.36Gb of data, it can be opened and analysed in the Instruments.app provided with the XCode developer tools.I have compressed this trace to a zip file, but even then, it weighs in at 300Mb.I am providing a link to this on my Dropbox account for anyone that is interested, has access to the XCode tools, and likes to poke around ;-)FWIW, the profile is of interest with regard to this bug from approximately 1.19 minutes from the start. What precedes that is LO starting up, and the call up and display of the StartCenter. The OpenGL code called just before malloc goes wild is the graphical UI action of dragging and dropping an OXT file via the UI onto the StartCenter window (this is actually really slow to do physically on a debug build but I got there in the end).The problems, at least with the mallocs, and the stalling of the application, appear to start after that, so the calls that you are probably interested in will be from 1.19 min onwards.Hi Alex; wow - sounds awesome. Is there any chance of some screencast / video of what goes on / wrong here ? - also I'm surprised to hear of OpenGL being used (by us) on the Mac - I believe it is off by default there - but of course, it's prolly used by the backend.

Without that this is very much a "something leaks" type report.Thanks !(In reply to Michael Meeks from)Hi Michael,That is precisely what the Instruments.trace file is for. It contains a hierarchical tree list of all calls made, but as far as I can tell, you can only exploit this file via the Instruments.app. In reality, the trace file is a compressed folder containing various objects that Instruments.app knows how to read and display and allows the user to pinpoint the calls being made at any given point along the profile. If the trace is coupled to symbols and source code, which it can be, and which I haven't undertaken, one can apparently examine the code path in even greater detail, but all of that is beyond me, I'm afraid.It seems to me that the problem isn't just a LO regression, but also affected by changes introduced with MacOS El Capitan.- Mavericks 10.9.5 & Yosemite 10.10.5: the problem described starts between LO 5.0.6.3 (working) - 5.1.0.1 (failing), without high CPU usage.- MacOS Sierra 10.12: haven't found a working version yet.CreatedXcode Instruments Memory Allocation LO 5.0.6.3 on Sierra 10.12Memory Allocation after double click on the extension.(In reply to Alex Thurgood from)I have a longer more - informative - SAL schedule trace output.

Only a forced kill allows the user to shut all app windows. None of the toolbars react to clicks, whether in the unopkg gui or any other LO open windows, even the main application menu at the top of the screen is unresponsive.Soo - looking at the code quickly which is in:desktop/source/deployment/gui/dp_gui_extensioncmdqueue.cxxIt -looks- strongly as if this is some threaded use of VCL that is assuming that things are thread-safe that are not:void ProgressCmdEnv::progressSection( const OUString &rText, const uno::Reference< task::XAbortChannel > &xAbortChannel ){ m_xAbortChannel = xAbortChannel; m_nCurrentProgress = 0; if ( m_pDialogHelper ) { m_pDialogHelper->updateProgress( rText, xAbortChannel ); m_pDialogHelper->updateProgress( 5 ); }}Which does all manner of dodgy stuff like: DialogHelper::PostUserEvent( LINK( this, UpdateRequiredDialog, startProgress ), reinterpret_cast<void*>(bStart) );which ultimately does:m_nEventID = Application::PostUserEvent( rLink, pCaller, true/*bReferenceLink*/ )Which does some somewhat 'optimistic' code around in Application::PostUserEvent - which may well deadlock; it requires the SolarMutex for this case.Looks like another instance of people assuming that the vcl main-loop and event posting is thread-safe.Still - there are so few events, and so little going on this is unlikely to be the cause of the issue.I imagine that PostUserEvent is (somehow) not working nicely on Mac when called from a different thread in this case - but impossible to debug without a mac.CreatedLLDB BacktraceCreatedLLDB BacktraceI did try to step somewhat through opening process of an OXT, but I haven't really a clue what i'm searching for.

For a general impression I would advice to search for: 'bt' (Match Whole Word Only) and 'unwind'Backtrace looks normal enough - it looks like the thread that does the install is getting on with its business - not blocking, and the main UI thread is in the process of doing / pushing some deferred rendering events; so - nothing too surprising there.

Should I tell the students to change LibreOffice version?Please help me the students are very disappointed with this experience.Thank you!Since this bug is continuing to cause confusion, I would like to post the following workaround. These are generic instructions â your operating system might have slightly different ways of doing things (eg. using a Linux package manager), but hopefully the general principle will make sense.Workaround- Go to the main LibreOffice download site at- Scroll down to the heading "Available Versions".- If a version starting with 5.3 (or any version higher than that) is available as a 'released' version (not a 'development' version), download that.*- If there is no version 5.3 or higher, download version 5.1.5.- Uninstall LibreOffice 5.2.x (where x is some version number).- Install LibreOffice 5.1.5 in its place.- Follow the steps in(above) to see if the problem still occurs. It should not occur now.What's going on here:- The bug described on this page exists only in LibreOffice 5.2.x. Any other version of LibreOffice should not have the bug.*note: at time of writing, this version is no yet available, but it will be available in the futureGeorge: you installed the *SDK*, not the actual LibreOffice: LibreOfficeDev_5.2.3.0.0_Win_x86_sdk.msi <- this is the wrong file.This would have been the correct file:***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***

id=100303	After updating to LO 5.1.3.2 on Ubuntu Xenial, Base Reports (built with ORB) crash when trying to apply conditional formatting to a field.

Create a condition, select a format (bold, color, italics, whatever)5. ApplyA message box pops-up with "std::bad_cast" and the whole of LO Base crashes.Existing reports containing conditional formatting created before the update to LO 5.1.3.2 do run properly, with fields being conditionally applied. However, when trying to edit these and modify their conditional formatting, the same bug happens and LO Base crashes.

I do apply updates on a very regular basis.Hello all,I conducted further testing. I set up a Debian Jessie VM in which I upgraded LO to 5.1.3.2 and again, same crashes when trying to use some conditional formatting in reports.Still in Debian Jessie, I then reverted back to LO 4.3.3 (official version in the official repo) and there, perfect, no crash. I saved the odb, opened it up in LO 5.1.3.2 and it ran fine, with conditional format. But again, it crashed if I tried to modify anything relative to conditional formatting.Back in Ubuntu Xenial, I installed a snap version of LO 5.2.0 beta and again, ORB crashed repeatedly when defining conditional formatting.Every time, with those different distros and those different LO versions, I tested both with my existing ODB file and with a new, blank one. Crashes occurred every single time, be it with my existing ODB or with a new one.I am surprised nobody can reproduce the crash -- I tried it on 2 different linux distros (although related -- Ubuntu Xenial and Debian Jessie), and on both distros ORB crashed exactly in the same way when trying to define a conditional format on a field, as previously described.Fred : which JDK is running on those machines when the crash occurs ?are you using the distrib provided ORB or have you installed the ORB from the extensions download site ?Unfortunately, my Ubuntu provided version of LO 503rc2 on LinuxMint 17.3 is so unstable that it crashes as soon as I try and create any kind of database report. Just starting the wizard is enough to bring it to its knees.

Hi Tim, FYI, this is a known issue, but I need to find the previous report.Hmm, the previous issue I was looking for was the fact that the Save button always appears as if changes were made even if the form had been saved and no other changes were made, whereas you are saying that there is no Save entry in the menu.I will check against my master build.Version: 5.3.0.0.alpha0+Build ID: 637371d4d90c2403f02d588ebe745368014b1032CPU Threads: 2; OS Version: Mac OS X 10.11.5; UI Render: default; Locale: fr-FR (fr.UTF-8)Tim, there should be an entry in the main File menu called "Update -", the keyboard shortcut for which is Ctrl-S (or Cmd-S on the Mac). This saves the form changes for me. Quite why the wording was changed to Update is beyond me, that was clearly a UX decision, probably because of the new Save button with the dropdown menu.The fact that the Save button doesn't change to represent the new state of the form is.Setting as WFM unless there is something I have missed.(In reply to Alex Thurgood from)I tried 'update'. It doesn't work, and the 'save' button still indicates that there are outstanding edits. On closing the edit form and re-opening it has not changed.And if I do an edit and close the form without attempting to update/save it doesn't ask if I want to save the form.I have reopened this (apologies if that's a break in protocol).There is no method by which I can save an edited form.

id=100883	Amazingly on Windows adding a *((int *)42) = 42; into the OpenCL code paths to test crash recovery - results in the CL driver passing the test - but not on master/4.3.This is due to the SEH exception handling throwing an exception there, which is caught; we fall-back to traditional calculation - and "life is good" ;-) unfortunately this mis-tags a failing CL kernel as a passing one.Need a way to count such failures in the shared opencl/ module.

id=101771	In my master debug build LO530 alpha on OSX 10.11.6, I can not save a form in which I have added a control from the control toolbar. When I attempt to save the form, LO hangs, requiring a forced kill.Steps to reproduce:1) Open a database file2) Create a new blank form3) Select a control from the control toolbar with the mouse, and then draw a rectangle on the form to insert the control.4) Now try and save the form by clicking on the Save icon in the main toolbar (Cmd-S).5) The Save dialog window is displayed. Both the "Help" and "Save" buttons are highlighted.6) Click on the "Save" button.7) The dialog does not disappear, and LO hangs (spinning beachball mode). lldb output seems to suggest that a thread gets stuck waiting for a mutex sync operation (something is not releasing the mutex) ?We seem to be beset by these mutex release/locking problems.Createdbacktrace from lldb debugging sessionTested against production release :Version: 5.2.0.4Build ID: 066b007f5ebcc236395c7d282ba488bca6720265Threads CPU : 2; Version de l'OS :Mac OS X 10.11.6; UI Render : par dÃ©faut; Locale : fr-FR (fr.UTF-8)No repro.So either a recent regression in master, or else the problem only shows in debug builds.Tested against :Version: 5.3.0.0.alpha0+Build ID: d7ce684cae03e97b23f916a90db55e49f17a1601Threads CPU : 4; Version de l'OS :Linux 4.4; UI Render : par dÃ©faut; Locale : fr-FR (fr_FR.UTF-8); Calc: groupon LinuxMint 18 and reproducible.In this build, the Save dialog disappears, but then the Form design window becomes unresponsive, and the mouse cursor displays as crosshairs as if one could draw a new control, but in fact it is impossible to click anywhere in the window other than on the window border "Close" icon.

If all goes right a number of parallel threads is executed then (CPU monitor shows User, IO Wait, and System processes ) and finally the UI is refreshed. In the bad case, which happens, say, every 10th save attempt (could be every other save attempt on bad days) I don't see the parallel processes at the end. The UI is frozen then and I have to kill it forcefully.I saw this behavior in the 4.x.x versions already, even on Windows 8.1, where the behavior was even worse. Interestingly, I used to run SuSE 13.2 in VirtualBox and there the behavior was better. When I moved on to a native SuSE 13.2 installation I saw problems increasing again.Reproducible: SometimesSteps to Reproduce:1. Open large document2. Do some (even minor) modifications3. Save4. Repeat until freeze is seen (about 10 times)Actual Results: UI frozen. Needs to be closed forcefully. The document needs to be recovered after the next start. The changes that were supposed to be saved are lost.Expected Results: Save file including changes done after last successful save.This bug looks similar to 100281 and 98750, but I hope I can provide some new information.SuSE Linux 13.2, Kernel 3.16.7-42-desktop, x86_64=> gdb reports a segmentation fault in the freeze case:[New Thread 0x7fffd28c5700 (LWP 25024)][Thread 0x7fffd28c5700 (LWP 25024) exited][New Thread 0x7fffd28c5700 (LWP 25025)][Thread 0x7fffd28c5700 (LWP 25025) exited]Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.[Switching to Thread 0x7fffbadf2700 (LWP 24910)]0x00007fffb40a7990 in ??

I cannot provide a sample presentation because it is all copyrighted material which must not become public. I could provide such an individual contributor given the recipient understands this restriction and promises to keep this presentation to himself/herself.Changing it to NEW as the backtrace has been providedHello Gizze,Is it possible that you attach a complete backtraceor a minimal document to reproduce the bug?I could only provide a sample file on a private basis outside this public bug tracking tool because it is subject to copyright. I can produce further traces if needed.CreatedBacktrace produced with soffice --backtraceGizze: would be interesting to hear, if the hangs continue with LibreOffice 5.2.x.(I unpacked the gdbtrace.log and reattached. I don't know why our wiki advised to pack it. I changed the wiki)(In reply to Buovjaga from)Thanks for this suggestion, Buovjaga.I did some further tests with LibreOffice 5.0.6.3:On an old 32-bit Pentium M machine (single threaded) with openSUSE 13.2I was not able to reproduce the problem.With 64-bit openSUSE 13.2 on a virtual machine I saw no crashes in a configuration with just one logical CPU. I observed regular crashes in a configuration with four logical CPUs.Conclusion: Maybe this is a race condition among several processes.This goes in line with the observation that the saving process always crashes towards the end when multiple parallel processes run on separate (logical) CPUs.This is what I found with LibreOffice 5.2.2.2:No crashes seen with 64-bit openSUSE on a virtual machine even in a configuration with four logical CPUsNo crashes seen with a 64-bit openSUSE bare bone installation on a four core CPU.Windows 8.1Frequent crashes still. I don't care about Windows, though. I compiled this presentation on Linux. Maybe we are seeing yet another problem at this point.So this looks good so far. Let me continue my daily work with this setup and see how reliable this LibreOffice version works now.Ok, I changed the OS field to Windows.You could get a backtrace with WinDbg:We should try and care about Windows as well ;)CreatedWindows BacktraceIndeed, we should care about Windows as well if we care about LibreOffice. Note that I usually do not work on Windows. Therefore the problem at hand may be an interoperability issue different from the problem I had on Linux originally.Anyway, I created a Windows backtrace following the instructions on the "How to get a backtrace with WinDbg" page. The symbol resolution does not seem to work properly yet. If this backtrace is not good enough let me know and include some hints to improve its quality.CreatedDebian BacktraceI have the same problem with Version 5.2.2.2.0+ from the Jessie Backports under Debian 8.6.Impress hangs ALWAYS. For example, when I open a new document and am going to save it, Impress freezes. This bug can be reproduced and makes Impress completely useless.I did not have problems with former versions.Not sure, how to proceed, but we seem to have a confirmation with bbugs's experience, so setting to NEW.the stack trace in the description matchessame for the one inis quite clever, yes this crash is a racestack apparently shows an error-box being displayed, not sure what to make of that, maybe the race didn't cause a crash but some exception instead...back-trace is useless, something killed soffice.bin before the stack could be obtainedi think the multi-threaded zip problem reported by "Gizze" should be fixed in current 5.1 / 5.2 releases, so maybe "bbugs" is seeing a different bug, but hard to tell without a proper backtrace.hello bbugs,could it be possible that you provide a backtrace with debugging symbols? You can download it fromand get the backtrace followingSetting the bug to NEEDINFO for the time being. Change it to NEW once the backtrace is providedcould be the same issue.(In reply to Michael Stahl from)Good news from my side:I have been working on Linux with 5.1 for a week now and I have not seen a single crash on save.Resolving - as presumed fixed - is that ok Gizze - would love to know if it continues to work for you ? if other similar (or even different ;-) problems recur - it would be great to open new bugs for them and mark this one as 'See Also' if they're related.Thanks !(In reply to Michael Meeks from)I have not seen a single crash on save on Linux ever since I went to version 5.1.So the Linux part of this can be closed from my side. That's what I cared about most, so this ticket could be closed.However, the Windows side does not seem to be clean yet, but that could be another issue (e.g. interoperability since I compiled the respective presentation on Linux). The Windows save operation seems to freeze earlier. So maybe it would be better to follow up on tickets related to the save operation which were submitted by Windows users.I am wondering, though, whether bbugs' observations should be handled further on this ticket.Thanks a lot for your support on this!(In reply to Gizze from)The Windows side can be followed up on in.(In reply to Aron Budea from)OK! Thanks again for all the support on this.

I put back version back because this field corresponds to the oldest LO version where the bug can be encountered.billy78: in your lab with Win7 if you install LO 5.2.2, it should be ok thanks toIndeed, this patch blacklist Intel drivers for Windows 7.Michael: should we blacklist Intel drivers for XP too?Julien, I think that I *did* try 5.2.2 and also crashed in my lab. However, since now I'm not really sure for the earliest version that the probleam appeared, on Monday I'll do a completely fresh install of LO 5.0.0, 5.1.0, 5.2.0 and 5.2.2 in my lab and also report opengl data.(In reply to billy78 from)Ok, think about renaming your LO directory profile (seehttps://wiki.documentfoundation.org/UserProfile#Windows) so it'll force LO to check Windows config during its next launch.Certainly - for anything < Windows 10 - the -Intel- drivers appear un-enumbered by things like thread-safety, testing, reliability.A patch to the XML to implement that much appreciated ! =)Then again - I could swear that GL should not be enabled on Windows XP at all - if it is that worries me generally, we should disable it there completely I think.Thanks.(In reply to Michael Meeks from)I agreeIndeed, I just noticed this: 47 <entry os="xp" vendor="all"> 48 <device id="all"/>So at least on XP, OpenGL should be disabled.(see)Would there be some bug on blacklist management?Billy: just to be sure, Force OpenGL option isn't checked, is it?Julien, Force OpenGL is not checked. Only "Use hardware acceleration" and "Use anti-aliasing" are checked, but these make no difference if I uncheck them too.I've done some tests with portable LO versions on my XP SP3 and I suspect that tomorrow I'll experience the same results for Win7:v5.0.0 does not crash (complex transitions just don't do anything)v5.1.0 and v5.1.5 do not crash (complex transitions just don't do anything)v5.2.0, v5.2.1 and v5.2.2 crash with the transitions that I have mentioned.I will change the earliest LO version affected to 5.2.0 (release, since I don't know about beta and RC) and I'll post the results with Win7 tomorrow.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Here's my comment from the other bug report:"Reproduced with v5.2.1.2 / Windows 7.Filing crash report wasn't offered, and WinDbg backtrace was useless, the only result of the analysis was that the application had exited.This is the content of opengl_device.log:DriverVersion: 2.7.1.6DriverDate: 6-18-2010DeviceID: PCI\VEN_102B&DEV_2539&SUBSYS_0040102B&REV_01AdapterVendorID: 0x102bAdapterDeviceID: 0x2539AdapterSubsysID: 0x0040102bDeviceKey: System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Video\{CC00E15A-1A8D-4171-B4B3-930DEB562651}\0000DeviceString: Matrox Millennium P690 PCIe x16"I have just finished my tests in a Win7 SP1 32-bit laptop.Transitions work up to v5.2.0 beta1 (alpha1 and beta1).

they don't make Impress crash. They actually do nothing during preview.CreatedODP with Fade on the 2nd slideI too have Impress crashing LO upon custom slide transition. Test file attached above. OpenGL disabled.However I recall not having this problem with 5.0 seriesI first encountered it on 5.1.5 (Still!)Then upon upgrading to the latest release 5.2.2, the same happens.I too have Impress crashing LO upon custom slide transition. Test file attached above. OpenGL disabled.However I recall not having this problem with 5.0 seriesI first encountered it on 5.1.5 (Still!)Then upon upgrading to the latest release 5.2.2, the same happens.Windows 7 + Intel GL is known to be a horror gallery. We should black-list that, the problem I guess is that we need to disable GL for presentations as well - separately somehow.Probably - we should disable Impress GL transitions for actively black-listed hardware/os/version combinations - that would solve this bug, rather than over-complicating things.Patches most welcome.(In reply to Michael Meeks from)That's one way to solve it, but I've also seen those fancy transitions working perfectly on my computer (Win7). It seems when some patch is made to fix a bug for another OS, things go down on this one: either some custom animation effects don't work properly (like popping in when "Fly In" is chosen), or crashing.Btw, I recall now that 5.0.6 was ok for me.I don't know why I set 5.0.0.5 as earliest version... adjusting to beta 2 based on Billy78's triage in. Thanks!***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***(In reply to Aron Budea from)That saves me (and probably many others) the confusion. :-)I'm still puzzled by "that is not supported (maybe because of low OPENGL version)". I can't see how OpenGL got "lowered" on 5.2. If this is unrelated, I suggest removing this part.Are you mixing up OpenGL with OpenCL?(In reply to KumÄra from)I don't have any knowledge about Impress transitions and I thought that the crashes occurred due to not high enough OpenGL version in my system. I have no idea what OpenCL is and how it is related. If you think that this part should be removed from the title, please do so :-)(In reply to billy78 from)Thanks for clarifying, Billy.I asked because you wrote: "Various OPENGL versions". What do you mean?Another thing: What do you mean by "They actually do nothing during preview." in?I'd like to make the Summary clearer, but before that please confirm this: You have "Automatic Preview" enabled?(In reply to KumÄra from)Actually, this report was set to 5.0.0.5 originally.Also, it seems to vary based on GPU capabilities, since the system I reproduced this with () crashes with 5.1.0.3, but not with 5.0.0.5.GLView reports 1.3 for the card.(In reply to KumÄra from)I have "Automatic Preview" enabled. Clicking in a non-crashing transition, makes the grey background around the slide to go black for a second (like a transition for the slide is being displayed, but actually there is no effect, the contents appear in their place) and then the slide becomes active again. No visible effect is being applied to the slide. During slideshow, no transition is being applied, the slides appear like they have no transition.The matter is probably explained here:Hello,experiencing the same on all Windows computers I tried (all Win 7). On Linux this works without issues.I can confirm with 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 is broken on Win, GL is reported to be disabled.

I hope the crash reports leaves enough of a trail to stop this from happening.It seems LibreOffice keeps my GPU pegged to discrete, which sucks, but might be an unrelated issue. Why does an office suite need my heavy, energy-hungry GPU?User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.71 Safari/537.36 I am of a mind to flag this as DUPLICATE ofEither it is a dup of that bug, which was seemingly resolved for most people when Apple updated OSX to 10.12.1, or in the alternative, the problem no longer exists for you as you indicate that LO no longer crashes, so this would be WFM.*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of***@Nicolas : if you want to open a new bug report requesting that LO not require the discrete graphics chip (request for enhancement), be my guest - someone might hopefully take an interest one day.Unfortunately, it happened again today. So this might not be the same thing. Note that I _am_ running OSX 10.12.1 and LO 5.2.3 (release). I'll attach another crash report.CreatedSecond crash, macOS reportFunny observation, when I start "soffice" from the command-line, it starts up normally. Perhaps that's what I did earlier when I sad it started to work. Starting it from the Dock or Finder makes it crash reliably.This works:$ /Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/sofficeRegrettably, starting it via Instruments (from xcode) also doesn't crash.My internet is too slow to download the gigantic LO repo so I loaded up LO in a debugger and disassembled Application::GetSolarMutex(), the function in which the sefault (NULL pointer) dereference happened:(lldb) disaslibvcllo.dylib`Application::GetSolarMutex:-> 0x102a823c0 <+0>: pushq %rbp 0x102a823c1 <+1>: movq %rsp, %rbp 0x102a823c4 <+4>: callq 0x102a85050 ; ImplGetSVData() 0x102a823c9 <+9>: movq 0x8(%rax), %rdi 0x102a823cd <+13>: movq (%rdi), %rax ; THIS IS THE OFFENDING LINE 0x102a823d0 <+16>: popq %rbp 0x102a823d1 <+17>: jmpq *0xa8(%rax) 0x102a823d7 <+23>: nopw (%rax,%rax)So, we expect to see a NULL pointer in %rdi, because it's trying to dereference that and placing it into %rax.

Normally in such a short function I'd assume %rdi is the first argument, as detailed in the calling convention (). However, we can see that %rdi is actually *(%rax + 8). And %rax is the return value of the call to ImplGetSVData(). We know from the thread state that %rax contains 0x000000010b3989d0, which isn't very useful right now since we don't have a core dump. How is ImplGetSVData() implemented?EDIT: Got the sources.comphelper::SolarMutex& Application::GetSolarMutex(){ ImplSVData* pSVData = ImplGetSVData(); return *(pSVData->mpDefInst->GetYieldMutex());}So mpDefInst is somehow NULL.

The code?ImplSVData* ImplGetSVData() { return &private_aImplSVData::get();}Heavily inlined. And private_aImplSVData is?namespace{ struct private_aImplSVData : public rtl::Static<ImplSVData, private_aImplSVData> {};}What the...? I have no idea what this is. A class inheriting from a class that takes two template parameters, including itself (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern?). Sure. The strange thing is that private_aImplSVData is mentioned only on the 3 lines I've already printed out. It's empty. I suppose ImplSVData is the true meat here, then. It's defined as:struct ImplSVData{ SalData* mpSalData = nullptr; SalInstance* mpDefInst = nullptr; // Default SalInstance Application* mpApp = nullptr; // pApp VclPtr<WorkWindow> mpDefaultWin; // Default-Window bool mbDeInit = false; // Is VCL deinitializing // Tons of stuff more.}Right, so the second pointer plainly never gets initialized.Anyway, back to this rtl::Static thingy, which I assume is some sort of fancy wrapper to make a singleton out of everything, the Java programmers' dream. It's a doozy, we find it in core/include/rtl/instance.hxx:/** Helper base class for a late-initialized (default-constructed) static variable, implementing the double-checked locking pattern correctly. @derive Derive from this class (common practice), e.g. <pre> struct MyStatic : public rtl::Static<MyType, MyStatic> {}; ...

Which means that for some reason on macOS Sierra, something thinks we don't HAVE_THREADSAFE_STATICS. I'm pretty sure we do on macOS Sierra, with any recent GCC or Clang for sure, and I bet this one was built with xcode (thus Clang).This () SO answer implies that -f(no-)threadsafe-statics flag is GCC specific. Indeed I can't find it in my clang(1) man page. So that might be another "bug", basically assuming that the compiler is GCC.I won't even paste the code of rtl_Instance here (it's in the same file), but suffice to say that a lot of text is spent on indicating how/why it can be optimized on which compilers. Just avoiding this shenanigans would thus be a good optimization, it seems.Anyhow. It's pretty clear that our ImplSVData is just not being initialized, and it's being called for the first time by GetSolarMutex, which obviously didn't expect an uninitialized ImplSVData back.The LO codebase is not familiar to me, so I'll leave it to someone with experience to figure out why ImplSVData is not being initialized.ThanksBy the way, normally I'd set a watchpoint on the variable I want within a successful run to see how it's supposed to be initialized. Sadly, I'd need to set a watchpoint on this now: 0x102a850e1 <+145>: movq %rbx, 0x2758e0(%rip) ; (anonymous namespace)::rtl_Instance<ImplSVData, rtl::Static<ImplSVData, (anonymous namespace)::private_aImplSVData>::StaticInstance, osl::Guard<osl::Mutex>, osl::GetGlobalMutex, int, int>::m_pInstanceMore anaonymous namespaces than I can count. This is where my knowledge of LLDB stops. If anyone has an idea how to set a watchpoint on that, I'm all ears.I'm getting more and more the feeling like this is some weird synchronization issue.GOOD: /Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/sofficeGOOD: lldb /Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/sofficeBAD: Open from dockBAD: Open from spotlightSo I couldn't debug it while it was in a bad state, I thought. Then I tried the next best thing: debug it as fast as possible. while : ; do if pgrep soffice ; then lldb -p $(pgrep soffice) ; fi ; doneIt's crude, but it works. Basically, attach to libreoffice as fast as possible after startup.I did: lldb> b CreateSalInstanceTo see whether it was actually being called (that's the thing that creates the object that gets assigned to mpDefInst). See core/vcl/source/app/svmain.cxx: // Initialize Sal pSVData->mpDefInst = CreateSalInstance(); if ( !pSVData->mpDefInst ) return false;It's also one of only 3 lines that modify it: $ ag 'mpDefInst =' core/vcl/inc/svdata.hxx:312: SalInstance* mpDefInst = nullptr; // Default SalInstance core/vcl/source/app/svmain.cxx:290: pSVData->mpDefInst = CreateSalInstance(); core/vcl/source/app/svmain.cxx:587: pSVData->mpDefInst = nullptr;Anyway, I ran it and it stopped at CreateSalInstance, indicating it was being called. Continuing the process afterwards made it keep going without a crash. Rats, I seem to have turned a "bad" invocation into a good one by debugging it.Next time, I tried putting a breakpoint on DeInitVCL, which is where mpDefInst gets reset to NULL. However, after setting the breakpoint, the process crashed with the well known bad access. So not every bad invocation turns good... or was it because I set the breakpoint on a different function?

That's done here: Application::Application() { // useful for themes at least, perhaps extensions too OUString aVar("LIBO_VERSION"), aValue(LIBO_VERSION_DOTTED); osl_setEnvironment(aVar.pData, aValue.pData); ImplGetSVData()->mpApp = this; InitSalData(); }Apparently, a global variable is set with the object that's being constructed (->mpApp = this). Neat. InitSalData() does something similar, but for ->mpSalData.At this point I'm pretty sure that the InitVCL() code ran: bool InitVCL() { if( pExceptionHandler != nullptr ) return false; EmbeddedFontsHelper::clearTemporaryFontFiles(); if( !ImplGetSVData()->mpApp ) { pOwnSvApp = new Application(); } InitSalMain(); ImplSVData* pSVData = ImplGetSVData(); // remember Main-Thread-Id pSVData->mnMainThreadId = ::osl::Thread::getCurrentIdentifier(); // Initialize Sal pSVData->mpDefInst = CreateSalInstance(); if ( !pSVData->mpDefInst ) return false; // ...But why is mpDefInst NULL then, in our bad runs? Are two threads racing? One trying to initialize everything (InitVCL) and the other somewhere calling GetSolarMutex()? If that's the case, that should be visible in our other thread stacktraces. It was a good theory, but using "thread backtrace all" tells me that's not the case. Argh.Wow, quite a lot of debugging information there.

Presumably this was never documented back when it was done. Was it ericb who did this work back in the days? Or Sun people? Did they leave any readable longer documentation or even some a condensed rationale?My guess is that they wanted the VCL code on Mac, once contortions at start-up have been done, to behave as if it was on an X-style windowing system, and they did some ugly hacks to make it seem so while having to touch as little code elsewhere as possible.Possibly it would have made more sense to actually make OOo be structured like a canonical Mac app, and instead adapt more code all over the place (vcl, framework, whatever) to work both in that case and in the X and Win32 cases.Not sure whether the Windows code manages more successfully to merge concepts of two fundamentally different windowing systems?Or am I confused/misguided, is it in fact so that it is the X code that jumps through hoops to be Windows-like? (And the Mac code too, then.) And the Windows code which is most "native" and has least weird tricks?I suspect hdu could be the best person to spread some light here, but he is not involved any more, is he?Useful keyword to google for are: ericb, ooo, aqua, port. (For some reason the OOo project to make it run natively (as opposed to using X11) on Mac OS X was called the "Aqua" port, even if, as far as I understand it, "Aqua" was just the name of the desktop theme of the time, and never has been the name of any API.)Iâm far of an expert, and I donât want to intrude. But maybe itâs wise to investigate the cause a bit more deeply, before acting. I should note that:- I have two macOS 10.12.1 installations: one for testing, one for regular usage. Only the testing system, on which I installed XCode, is badly affected. It seems to be some sort of file corruption, because I have trouble with all versions I tested (4.4/5.0)- On my regular system I have had some issues with a few daily builds (around 5 November) crashing SIGSEGV 11 on launch, but I havenât had an issue with LO 5.2.3.3 or more recent daily builds.- On my regular system Iâm able to crash Activity Monitor with SIGSEGV 11 in some circumstances while starting LibreOfficeDev, but Iâm not sure whether itâs related.CreatedmacOS crashreports Activity MonitorIn my experience LO runs once after installing and then crashes every time afterwards. For a time I also associated this with installing the language pack (PL in my case), but it seems to have no bearing (I was simply installing LO, running it once and then installing the language pack, running it again and crash).The workaround mentioned by someone on IRC to disable graphics card switching in power saving options works for me.I'm on MBP 6,2 (dual graphics Intel and Nvidia 330M), macOS Sierra 10.12.1, trying to use LO 5.2.3.3.I also have a Mac Pro at work which I think had the crashing, too, despite not having dual graphics. I'll try to look into it tomorrow.Is it time to confirm the bug?@Dominik: Thanks for the additional input. This bug is NEW since it has been confirmed on 2016-11-07. No need to confirm further.Using a newly created User Account seems to fix the issue ()(In reply to Telesto from)Ah, that is interesting. I'll try in a sec.My Mac Pro runs LO just fine. It doesn't come with switching graphics.I just tested with a new user profile on my MBP. LO ran just fine, but it turns out the new account had graphics switching turned off by default. Turning it on, LO started crashing at once.(In reply to Dominik from)Sounds like.***has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ******has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***Alex How can this be a duplicate? I can reproduce the problem and the solution every time. I'm running MACOS X 10.12.2 and LibreOffice 5.2.4 (Newly Released).These are the steps I go through every time and if I bring it up this way it works.Closing the Terminal.app, under the Utilities folder, will terminate the entire "LIbreOffice" program, but The Terminal Window remains open.I don't know if I'm explaining this so anyone can understand it, because I'm not (by profession), a programmer. However, I can see somewhere in the compiled version of "soffice" Exec file, the script is telling the Terminal.app to exec first, THEN to execute LIbreOffice.Here's how I now have to use this application:1. I execute "soffice" from the MacOS folder in the Contents folder2. I Wait for the Terminal.app to execute and bring up the Terminal Window3. I keep the Terminal.app running paying attention to the messages printed in the window.4. After a short time Maybe 5 second) LibreOffice comes up "Normally"5. Using the "Quit LIbreOffice" on the menu file, I can see the Terminal.app being told to exit and LibreOffice ends.If the Terminal.app is not running, LibreOffice will crash every time.Also, if you try and execute LibreOffice in the Applications Folder, it will crash every time.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:Below is what I saw on the "Terminal" Window as LibreOffice executes from the MAC OS directory using the soffice Exec file."Last login: Sat Jan 7 13:12:59 on console-bash: PATH: command not found-bash: PATH: command not found/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice ; exit;Macintosh:~ millersranch$ /Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice ; exit;"Below are the results returned and printed to the Terminal window screen after you've pressed "Quit LibreOffice" in the application.logoutSaving session......copying shared history......saving history...truncating history files......completed.Deleting expired sessions...none found.[Process completed]Please NOTE: After the [Process completed] statement, the Terminal App stays open. You have to close it manually.This Bug reports something about the "User Profile" and something about a "Switch" being set to "ON". I don't know where this switch is and I have deleted previous User profiles from the LibreOffice/4/user directory. If there is a "Patch" for this, I don't know where to find it. Seeing how this Bug is also happening under MacOS 10.12.2 and continues under LibreOffice 5.2.4.1, tells me this can't be the same problem as reported here. I don't need to change a "Switch" or my "User Profile" to use the application as described above. This problem appears to be a PATH statement problem as indicated by the Terminal Results:-bash: PATH: command not found-bash: PATH: command not foundI can use the application this way without changing any of the things mentioned in this Bug report. I don't have any stack trace/backtrace software to print out the errors or how the program is executing. I just know it works every time when I apply the procedure above. I will continue to use it this way, until someone figures out why the "LibreOffice.app doesn't work from the Applications directory.The crash seems to occur in three situations:1. Systems with dual graphics chips and "Automatic graphics switching" enabled2. A change in the default profile configuration (I suspect non-default bash settings)3. Restarting a Mac while running LibreOffice and "Reopening windows when logging back in" selected (and the first two situations donât apply)I donât have a dual graphic system. So can't help there. I can confirm howeveris working for point 2.

Select Preferences3. Select Advanced4. Under Java Options, Uncheck "Use Java Runtime Environment"5. ....Here it should be noted whether you need to restart your Computer or just LibreOffice to have these changes take effect.After this box was unchecked, I closed LO and tried to restart the program without shutting down the Computer. The results were LO still crashed.I feel these types of comments will help everyone track this problem.Update:After Deselecting the JAVA Runtime environment, LO did work on the first try after the MAC was restarted. However, further attempts to use the application failed. I've gone back to starting/using LO the way it works for me.In 5.2.2, I was able to work around the problem by reopening. It would stay open the second time each day.In 5.2.5, I am not able to work around the problem.Each time, MacOS verifies LibreOffice, then LibreOffice opens and crashes.(In reply to Telesto from)I don't ever remember selecting that, but I reinstalled 5.2.2, found and deselected that, reopened 5.2.5 in the dmg, and had it crash again.
id=104107	Description:Opening any Base file in LO5233 previously created with an older version of LibreOffice, i.e. before 5233, causes that file to become corrupted on closing and shutting down of LibreOffice, even if no changes have occurred in the database file. Even LO5233 can no longer display any of the objects within the file if is subsequently re-opened in LO5233. An error message is displayed.Steps to Reproduce:1. Open an ODB file created with a previous version of Base in LO52332. Click on Tables3. Make no changes, close the file.4. Close LibreOffice5. Re-start LibreOffice6. Load the same ODB file7. Try clicking on the Tables icon - an error message is displayed, but no table list8. Try any other db object that was previously available in the file (queries, reports, etc) - the same error message is displayed.Actual Results: The ODB file has been corrupted and will not open in any other version of LibreOffice.Expected Results:The file should open in any other version of LibreOffice without incident.Reproducible: AlwaysUser Profile Reset: NoAdditional Info:User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:49.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/49.0 Seeing this in lldb :Process 877 launched: '/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice' (x86_64)2016-11-22T12:43:27.530+0100 SEVERE DataFileCache.reset commitjava.io.IOException: No OutputStream at com.sun.star.sdbcx.comp.hsqldb.NativeStorageAccess.write(Native Method) at com.sun.star.sdbcx.comp.hsqldb.StorageAccess.write(StorageAccess.java:86) at com.sun.star.sdbcx.comp.hsqldb.StorageAccess.writeLong(StorageAccess.java:124) at org.hsqldb.persist.RAStorageWrapper.writeLong(Unknown Source) at org.hsqldb.persist.DataFileCache.reset(Unknown Source) at org.hsqldb.persist.Log.checkpointClose(Unknown Source) at org.hsqldb.persist.Log.checkpoint(Unknown Source) at org.hsqldb.persist.Log.checkpoint(Unknown Source) at org.hsqldb.persist.Logger.checkpointInternal(Unknown Source) at org.hsqldb.persist.Logger.checkpoint(Unknown Source) at org.hsqldb.persist.Logger.open(Unknown Source) at org.hsqldb.Database.reopen(Unknown Source) at org.hsqldb.Database.open(Unknown Source) at org.hsqldb.DatabaseManager.getDatabase(Unknown Source) at org.hsqldb.DatabaseManager.newSession(Unknown Source) at org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCConnection.<init>(Unknown Source) at org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver.getConnection(Unknown Source) at org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver.connect(Unknown Source)2016-11-22T12:43:27.559+0100 SEVERE checkpoint failed -

Hope it'll help for tdf#104481 too.Concerning gtk2, thank you for your feedback, I wasn't sure about it.With master sources updated yesterday (which includes the fix for this bugtracker), I don't reproduce the crash.The weird thing is I don't see any log corresponding to this part:catch (const uno::Exception& e) { SAL_INFO("vcl.a11y", "exception: " << e.Message);}After changing locally SAL_INFO to SAL_WARN for the test, I got this:warn:vcl.a11y:17405:1:vcl/unx/gtk/a11y/atkutil.cxx:106: exception: so no exception message here.(idem for tdf#104481)
